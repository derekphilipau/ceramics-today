        <p><b><a href="books/artful_teapot.html">The Artful Teapot</a></b><br>
          Garth Clark's newest book on the teapot was published to accompany the 
          major travelling show of the same name. The book offers not only the 
          opportunity to view many of the works in 2D, but also gives various 
          insights into the discourses surrounding the world of tea - a fitting 
          addition to the tea lover's or teapot enthusiast's library.</p>
        <p><b><a href="articles/040201.html">Teapots Transformed, Exploration of
          an Object</a></b><br>
          Leslie Ferrin's publication is a tour-de-force of contemporary teapot 
          design. A beautifully crafted 128 page, full-color book with over 120 
          illustrations - a wonderful book for anyone with an interest in The 
          Contemporary Teapot.</p>
        <p><b><a href="articles/102797.html">The Eccentric Teapot, Four Hundred
          Years of Innovation</a></b><br>
          Garth Clark takes a look at the more gregarious manifestations of that 
          humble but universal domestic appliance, the teapot. Far from the simpler 
          examples, as may e.g. be found in your average Chinese restaurant (ever 
          seen one with the lid attached with fishing line?), this survey of teapots 
          of the past four centuries covers everything from Yixing pots to the 
          Japanese Book of Tea, the Boston Tea Party to the famous &quot;Suprematist 
          Teapot&quot; by Kasemir Malevich. </p>
