The slide I have sent depicts a piece tiled 'The Eye of the Beholder'. It is from an exhibition of my work last year which was titled 'The Visual Arts -Specific Views'.
<P>
Presently my work explores very literal physical attributes of 'how we see'. While there are often humourous overtones the main concern is a 'double-take' type of reaction from the viewer as well as a 'double-think'.
<P>
This year my work has moved to require physical interation with the viewer... I wish I'd made this departure sooner -then again, now is good!
