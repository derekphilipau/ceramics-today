This series of functional tableware includes teapots, teacups, serving platters, communal bowls, individual plates, bowls, soup dishes, sauce and condiment dishes, cannisters.
<P>
The style combines narrow-footed asian ceramic influences with some futuristic images. It suits asian foods and incorporates a pierced rim which functions as a rest for chop sticks.
<P>
The uneven rim frames and draws the eye to the chop stick holder. This element is continued in the vessels, where the hole would not be useful (eg teacups) and also provides for eye catching lidded containers (eg teapot).
<P>
I have been influenced by some similarly shaped wooden bowls, each one in the set turned from different Australian timbers, seen on a visit to the north coast of New South Wales.
<P>
The glaze is a talc white over a highly glossy and very dark green, known among my recent fellow students as 'Liam's Green'. This was chosen as a strong plain colour was needed, with variations occuring through the use of the talc showing areas breaking up softly.
<P>
I plan to further develop this concept of pierced shapes in uneven rims with the Australian icons and motifs for decoration on platters, serving bowls and presentation pieces.
