 My work takes its inspiration from the natural world. It
reflects both my personal history of living on the Kansas prairie
and the geologic history of the land itself. Thus the titles and
forms of "Prairie Memories" refer to specific sites or events as
well as the land's memory of earlier forms and forces. Elements of, the landscape
undulating hills, water-worn gullies, or waving wheatfields
are abstracted and combined to express specific
memories as well as the distilled essence of nature.
<P>
 I want others who view my work to respond to it on both a
personal and universal level. I hope viewers recall glimpses from
their own past as well as recognize the greater scope of history
when seen from the viewpoint of geologic memory. The other obvious
concern evident in my work is a fascination with sensuous forms
expressing graceful movement and balance. Even in the post-modern
artworld, I believe that art can still be valid in contemplation of
the Beautiful. Clay is a natural medium for these ideas because it
not only represents the earth, but is of the earth.
