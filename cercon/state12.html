Have been working in ceramics since 1981 and have exhibited nationally
and internationally since 1988. My techniques, forms and ideas have
changed and taken many different directions over the years. Recently,
have been working with ceramic paper, using a technique I developed
myself to produce a flexible, thin porcelain paper which can be folded
or cut just like ordinary paper. After firing, the paper becomes a
translucent ceramic object.
