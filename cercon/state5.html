My primary interests lie in exploring the intimate relationships that
Ceramists have with clay.<P>
Clay appeares passive, offering little or no resistance to our intrustions. It
lavishes in being twiddled and rubbed. Shiny surfaces glow with excitment.
The malleable material is readily accepted into close subjective spaces, as
we uninhibitedly project our fantasies onto it, anticipating lasting
relationships. It responds to our touching by holding traces of these events.
The end product : a representation of the bonding, encases our most telling
tales. Moments of complete and utter trust.<P>
Clay has the ability to mimick certain traits that are characteristic of other
materials. It is accepted not as a substitute, but as a replacement. Affinitive
relationships are built on chosen characteristics that have appealled to our
senses. Compositions are limitless, and infinite options are available to the
Ceramist, offering a new experience with each encounter.
Freud and Stokes, amongst others, suggested that an Artist's need to
respond to tactile materials lies deep in the subconscious and can be traced
back to childhood.
<P>
Paul Gauguin proclaimed himself the first Ceramic-Artist, and that his
affintity with clay came from a childhood surrounded by his mother's
collection of Peruvian pots. Bernard Leach recalled his youth in Singapore,
and the action and imaginary interaction of playing with worm casts before
they could harden. More recently Ceramists, such as Lawson Oyekan, have
been producing work that brings their national and instinctual identity to the
fore. While others, such as Grayson Ferry, fetishise their relationships with
clay. Speaking personally, I retreated to the bottom of the garden, where in
the dry African heat I made mud-pies with my little watering-can.
<P>
I have a passion for squeezing, squelching and slopping clay. My pieces are
imbued with imagery from my past : both distant and near. The structures
are influenced by English medieval buildings : showing strength and
durability despite fragility. Occassional impressions reveal history. Surface
patterns come from a vast range of sources that I have encountered
throughout life :tomb paintings, massonic and universal symbols. Internal
paintings is deeply personal and based on sensation.
My work is constructed quickly, in a bid to hold in freshness. I am told the
wobbly bits have a quality of immediacy which reflects my impatient nature:
an eagerness to retu m to the material and a desire to reinvestigate the
relationship.
<P>
Whether it is to continue a fantasy or to explore a different approach, the
attraction to clay is as strong as when it was first encountered. The
compulsion is propelled by additional qualities invested as the relationship
progresses.
Fissile reactions held within the impressionable bodies of clay clearly reflect
the ceramist's state of mind. Tensions lead to ecstatic visionary trances that
carry dreams, a lapse of time while dreams are transfixed into matter.
There is a desire to be compelled...
<P>
<I>Return often and take me,<BR>
beloved sensation, return and take me -<BR>
when the memory of the body awakens,<BR>
and old desire again runs through the blood,<BR>
when the lips and the skin remember,<BR>
and the hands feel as if they touch again.
<P>
Return often and take me at night,<BR>
when the lips and the skin remember...</I><P>
