The "B- ware"series
<P>
'I"he "B-ware" series is inspired by non ceramic sources. The forms are
influenced by "water tanks", metal fabrication, pop rivetin~ and
welding. Pieces are joined in ways unorthodox to functional ceramics.
There is a play on the seeming strength of joins used in metalwork,
with the precariousness of them when used in clay. "B-ware" can come
to mean "Beware" in warning of the need for care when using these
pieces.<P>
The series is questioning the attitudes of society where glass and
crystal are afforded the utmost care, and their delicacy treasured;
hoFuesrer ceramics are expected to be solid and robust. Therefore,
perhaps, in the world of functional ceramics these pieces could be
considered "B" class ware, where their functionality is not their
primary concern. This is treated in a humorous way in the design of
the saucers of this series, the radiation sign cut into the base of them
