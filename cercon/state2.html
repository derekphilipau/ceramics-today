TONGUE IN CHEEK
<P>
My ceramic animals are playfully confrontational. The viewer is presented with
pink fleshy tongues, puckered-up lips and gaping mouths, and is left with a smile
on the face, and perhaps a slightly raised eyebrow. My work is a light-hearted
dig in the ribs at serious 'Art', and at people's sensibilities about what is
'proper'. There is a cheeky slightly eccentric sensuality with a hint of kitsch.
<P>
Giraffes have protruding tongues, chimpanzees offer smooches, and elephants
wave sinuous trunks. A lion's tongue lolls between pointed teeth, and a zebra
looks you in the eye as it licks its thick black lips. Sensual hippopotami bare
gaping pink mouths festooned with crooked teeth, or lie partly submerged,
casually observing passers-by. Also present is a shark, a platypus, and echidnas
with pointy tongues flicking out the end of pliable snouts.
<P>
I usually brew an idea for an animal caricature in my mind for quite some time,
until I can visualise it clearly. It is exciting watching my mental image take
shape. I like to work with radio national on to occupy my rational mind. Ifnot,
it tends to interfere and get overjudgmental and fussy about what I'm making.
When given free reign, my creative mind works in a purposeful, serene almost
meditative way, forging a direct link between mind's eye and hands.
<P>
I work in stages, on a number of sculptures at one time. Using coils 1 build up
the basic form, leave it to firm up, then refine the shape and add the details of
eyes, ears, tongues etc. The work is then painted with coloured slips, dried very
slowly and fired to earthenware temperatures. Various post-firing processes are
sometimes employed to complete the sculpture.
<P>
The fact that I have a lot of fun making these animals is evident in their cheeky
ribaldry. It is a delight to feel new ideas brewing in my mind and a challenge to
bring those ideas into the physical world.
