Method of Construction
<P>
Work is hand thrown using limoges porcelain.  At the leather hard stage bases are removed and the forms are altered.  New bases are then attached.  Surfaces are carefully refined to enhance and clarify forms.  The soft edges and flowing lines of theses vessels follow the contours of the hand and invite the touch of the viewer.  After bisque firing, glaze is applied by spraying to give a subtle and even result.
The forms are then fired to 1280ï¿½C to vitrify the porcelain.

Statement
<P>
My work explores the ability of volume to define and modify the space it occupies, with the intention of guiding the viewers vision and challenging their perception.
