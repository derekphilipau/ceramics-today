              Ashraf</a></b> is an Egyptian-born studio potter resident in Britain. 
              Ashraf studied art and design at El-Minya College of Fine Art in 
              Egypt from 1986-1989 and theater design at Central St. Martins College 
              of Art &amp; Design in London from 1991-1994. He began working with 
              clay in 1997 and established a studio in 1998. He has been a member 
              of the British Craft Potters Association since 1999.

            <p>Inspired by ancient forms and techniques, Ashraf hand-builds his 
              earthenware vessels which are burnished and then smoke-fired. Decorative 
              effects are achieved with the help of resist techniques.
            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p>Work is concerned with achieving the balance of creating ceramics 
              which are inextricably linked to the forms and techniques of the 
              ancient world yet utterly contemporary in their personality. I am 
              always excited by the prospects of the interaction between the precision 
              of my designs and the spontaneity of the fire. The technique of 
              Raku, smoke-fired ceramics poses many challenges, it is seemingly 
              simple yet one that is quite laborious and often fraught with difficulties. 
              One can never take the results for granted since a successful piece 
              is essentially the result of a collaboration between design and 
              chance, precision and spontaneity, artist and elements for it is 
              the flames which ultimately breath life into the work.</p>

            <p> <b>Technical Notes</b></p>
            <p> Clay bodies: Earthstone, smooth white stoneware.</p>
            <p> The form is started as a pinch pot then developed using slabs. 
              Once completed the form is refined with metal and rubber kidneys. 
              Burnishing is very important to the final result, I therefore meticulously 
              repeat the process until the desired surface is achieved . After 
              a biscuit firing to 1000 c, the piece is subjected to the smoke 
              firing using a variety of resist techniques, currently I am exploring 
              the technique of naked raku where the biscuit fired ware is covered 
              with a thick layer of slip,once dried a thin layer of glaze is brushed 
              on and the required pattern is incised through both clay and glaze 
              with a sharp skewer stick. Work would normally be fired to 850c 
              or until the glaze has matured. The piece is then removed to a reducing 
              chamber where it would be covered by sawdust . After cleaning a 
              layer of wax is applied to enhance and seal the surface.</p>
