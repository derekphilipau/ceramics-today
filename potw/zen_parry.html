            <p><a href="images/zen_parry/Madonna_Wore_Pigtails.jpg"><img src="images/zen_parry/Madonna_Wore_Pigtails_sm.jpg" alt="Madonna Wore  Pigtails" width="160" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>With 
              an art practice based on pilgrimages, Australian ceramist Zen Parry&#8217;s 
              haunting archetypes seem to carry a message that transcends an individuals&#8217; 
              cultural reference or heritage. Zen&#8217;s signature triangular 
              form is a metaphor for the dark corners of the human psyche, i.e. 
              those thoughts that you would rather not confront. These pilgrimages 
              can take up to 4 months to complete, and are often grueling exercises 
              in discipline and physicality involving endurance and mental focus. 
              It is when the walking cycle has been completed that she retreats 
              to her studio so that the real journey may begin. Her latest works 
              include the cult of the Black Madonna in Poland, inspiration from 
              walking along the River Ganges in India and completing the 88 temple 
              circular pilgrimage on Shikoku island, Japan. 
            <p>Zen&#8217;s educational background is non-art focused, however, 
              her working method is entirely craft based. Her application of ceramic 
              principles is minimal, preferring instead to work with pit-fired 
              clay, and components that are hand made and assembled, borne of 
              process and ritual, not wheel and kiln. She was received numerous 
              grants and awards for her sculptural work, and prefers a lifestyle 
              based on experiencing different cultures directly when ever possible. 
              Currently she is balancing her art career between the USA, Eastern 
              Europe and Korea. </p>
            <p><b>Artist Statement</b>:<br>
              Archetypal forms, and their undercurrents, have always inspired 
              me, and have now become the primary form of expression in the artwork 
              that I create. As a global Artist these forms create a universal 
              language that is understood or sensed well beyond geographic or 
              political borders.</p>
            <p>As a Sculptor, I am focused on &#8216;making by hand&#8217;, preferring 
              to incorporate the marks of each process boldly and actively, and 
              to present commonplace craft traditions in surprising and contemporary 
              ways. These traditions are often learnt and studied in cultures 
              outside of my own.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/zen_parry/Installation_Ceske_Krumlov.jpg"><img src="images/zen_parry/Installation_Ceske_Krumlov_sm.jpg" alt="Installation view from Ceske Krumlov, Czech Republic, 2004" width="154" height="231" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/zen_parry/Red_Saree.jpg"><img src="images/zen_parry/Red_Saree_sm.jpg" alt="Red Saree" width="154" height="231" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Preferred materials are pit-fired or raku ceramics and natural 
              fibers, both of which respond to intimate touch that creates a bond 
              with the maker that can then be transmitted to the viewer. As a 
              counterpoint to that aesthetic, the same forms are also constructed 
              using glass, electronic sensors and fiber optics. The glass components 
              are constructed using torchwork techniques, and the fiber optics 
              and sensors are incorporated inside each pod. These independent 
              works are often combined in large installations. The audience is 
              invited into the environment so that they may experience the tactile 
              qualities and ponder the sculptural and conceptual qualities of 
              the work in that space.</p>
            <p>These sculptures are like personal signposts and mementos from 
              each journey and adventure that is undertaken. They can imply different 
              emotions or experiences, and never fail to engage the viewer on 
              some level. Where the ceramic works might draw the viewer to them, 
              the glass works arrest the audience in their passage, creating a 
              very different visual relationship. I always hope that both forms 
              will entice the audience to return, again and again.</p>
