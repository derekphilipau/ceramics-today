              Rasmussen<br>
              </b></font>Danish studio potter 
            <p><img src="../images/clickable.gif" width="85" height="54"> 
            <p>Danish ceramist Peder Rasmussen&acute;s twelve sphere-shaped vases 
              in the museum <a href="http://www.keramion.de">KERAMION</a> in Frechen 
              have evolved over the past two years. They emerged as a reaction 
              to twenty years of working with form and ornamental decoration solely. 
              In the early eighties the Danish artist worked a lot with the human 
              figure, with a kind of post-pop painting on the pots. Now again 
              he recognized a need to induct story, content and sometimes meaning 
              into the works. But the overall intention still is &#8211; as it 
              always was - the making of beautiful, decorative pots.<br>
              <br>
              The shape had to be simple to make room for the decoration, and 
              the sphere has the advantage, that it almost automatically leads 
              the spectator to take a tour around it. And it is a shape that provides 
              you with a lot of painting space. A small foot and a hole at the 
              top: there you have the perfect three-dimensional background &#8211; 
              as ideal for the potter as the square canvas is for the painter.
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Peder_Rasmussen/Vase1.jpg"><img src="images/Peder_Rasmussen/thumbs/Vase1.jpg" width="208" height="240" border="0"></a><a href="images/Peder_Rasmussen/Vase2.jpg"><img src="images/Peder_Rasmussen/thumbs/Vase2.jpg" width="222" height="240" border="0"></a>
            <p>Some of the decorations on this new series of vases derive from 
              Rasmussen&acute;s interest in the connection between ornament, letters 
              &#8211; sometimes text - and the human figure. However they are 
              not linked up by a general, continuing story &#8211; they are all 
              individual works with each their special motif and atmosphere. </p>
            <p>Some motifs are very straightforward: A man walking, jumping, tumbling 
              and falling &#8211; accompanied by these same words. Other motifs 
              tell simple stories about relations between boys and girls - or 
              men and women. One motif directs you around the pot to discover 
              the content of a spiral shaped, continuing story; another can be 
              read as a four-chapter story. And others depict dreamy conditions 
              - like people flying around in their own peaceful worlds. The atmosphere 
              of some of the motifs is indeed one of weightlessness and tranquillity.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Peder_Rasmussen/Vase3.jpg"><img src="images/Peder_Rasmussen/thumbs/Vase3.jpg" width="206" height="240" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>All the vases are made in a plaster mould, and all are more or 
              less the same size &#8211; ca. 55 cm (21.7 in.). A black German 
              earthenware clay is used under a slip-decoration, which has been 
              both painted and engraved &#8211; the so called sgrafitto technique. 
              All vases are glazed with a classic, glossy lead-glaze fired at 
              1025 C.</p>
