              Kazuya</b></a> (b. 1976) is the son of <a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/furutani-michio-memorial.html"><b>Furutani 
              Michio</b></a> (1946-2000), a Shigaraki potter greatly respected 
              for his work with the anagama, or wood-burning tunnel kiln. Before 
              his death, Michio could lay claim to having the best firings in 
              Shigaraki. Actually, it was Furutani who reintroduced the anagama 
              to Shigaraki since medieval times, and had built more anagama than 
              any other potter during his time (30 since 1970). His studies into 
              anagama led him to write a highly influential book as well. For 
              Furutani each kiln was built with a specific firing effect in mind 
              and it is no exaggeration to say he had the most varied, controlled 
              and amazing yohen effects Shigaraki has ever known. His sudden death 
              in 2000 shocked the ceramic art world. 
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya7.jpg" width="285" height="171">
            <p>However, his son Kazuya has spiritedly taken over the kiln of his 
              father/master, and his valiant firings have already labeled Kazuya 
              a master of the anagama, and certainly heir to the throne. A glance 
              at Kazuya's work will quickly call to mind the firings of his father 
              -in many ways, Kazuya has achieved what took his father decades 
              of experimentation to produce. He has learned well from his father, 
              even building his own kilns where all the current works were fired.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya8.jpg" width="400" height="178"></p>
            <p>Born in Shigaraki, Kazuya went to Shigaraki High School focusing 
              on design. He then studied at the Yamaguchi Art School for 2 years, 
              then the Kyoto Prefecture Ceramic Art School. It was in Kyoto that 
              many told him to hurry back to Shigaraki to be with his ill father. 
              He apprenticed with his father for two and half years, yet much 
              was learned as a youngster by just 'being around' and you'll read 
              an interesting Japanese proverb to illustrate that point in the 
              first link below.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya3.jpg" width="165" height="220"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya2.jpg" width="190" height="220"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya4.jpg" width="163" height="220"></p>
            <p> The secret to the Furutani family's pottery is through the Furutani 
              formula of clay processing (they have a cache of the best kinose 
              Shigaraki clay), kiln loading (Michio calls this the most important 
              aspect), and kiln firing -Michio's technique lives on in his son 
              Kazuya. Kazuya has also been studying 'The Way of Tea' for a few 
              years now and plans to introduce chawan next year.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya5.jpg" width="238" height="220"><img src="images/Furutani_Kazuya/Furutani_Kazuya6.jpg" width="251" height="220"></p>
            <p>Kazuya is a humble young man yet already has a large following 
              here in Japan. His yearly exhibitions in Tokyo have all been near 
              or full sell-outs. It's easy to see why and we hope you enjoy his 
              warm hi-iro fire colors and intensely beautiful hikidashi pulled 
              out of the kiln Iga pieces with mesmerizing greens.</p>
