              ceramist <a href="http://home.clara.net/peterbeard/index.html"><b>Peter
              Beard</b></a> has been a Fellow of the Craft Potters Association 
              since 1976 and a member of the International Academy of Ceramics 
              since 1999. Beard studied industrial design and furniture design 
              at Ravensbourne College of Art in London from 1970&#8211;73. In 
              1975 he opened his first studio in Kent, making one-of-a-kind pieces. 
            <p>Beard is known for his wheel-thrown vessels and hand-built biomorphic 
              stoneware sculpture with layered shiny, matt and semi-matt glazes. 
              Some works are inticately carved in unglazed black stoneware or 
              white porcelain and bone china. Beard also works in bronze and glass. 
              He cites as his main source of inspiration landscape in all forms 
              and the art of ancient Egypt. In 1996 he was awarded the INAX European 
              Design Prize in Japan and in 2002 he won a Silver Medal at the International 
              Biennale of Ceramic Art in Vallauris, France. He also published 
              a book, <i>Resist and Masking Techniques</i> in 1996.

<p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p>&quot;The objective of my work is to produce beautiful objects 
              that are modern, yet owe an allegiance to history, giving them a 
              timeless quality.
            <p>Strong simple shapes are decorated with complex glaze surfaces 
              to complement and excite the eye. Landscape in all forms is my main 
              source of inspiration, along with the art of ancient Egypt. Combinations 
              of shiny, matt and semi-matt glazes are built up in layers to create 
              the textural surfaces during firing. Wax is used to isolate areas 
              during glaze application&quot;.</p>

            <p><b>An Insight to Peter Beard, his Work and his Philosophy</b><br>
            </p>
            <p>Art communicates by combining process, materials and concept, this 
              fusion is particularly poignant in the world of ceramics. Peter 
              Beard has explored this area through his ceramics for many years 
              and his success is verified by international reputation.</p>
            <p>Making is central to the crafts and arguably it defines the nature 
              of the man, the toolmaker. The earliest ceramics took the form of 
              idols offered to the gods on a fire, thus proving that the act of 
              making has spiritual and aesthetic considerations equalling, or 
              perhaps exceeding, its utilitarian ones.</p>
            <p>Peter Beard is primarily interested in aesthetic considerations; 
              his experience transcends the skill needed to create an object. 
              It is his ability to define and create a beautiful object that singles 
              him out. Although Peter is a master of the processes he employs, 
              (usually slab building or throwing) he is not a slave to technique. 
              He draws together slabs of clay to form an elegantly twisting line 
              along the edge of a pot, yet he is brave enough to leave the rim 
              pinched and fresh, acknowledging the act of forming the clay.</p>
            <p>If a process is to speak of anything then it must speak unabashedly 
              of itself; the hand forming the clay. Every pot Peter makes bears 
              testimony to this.</p>
            <p>Ceramics is one of the few areas where art meets science. The selection 
              of materials is often based on empirical as much as on personal 
              preference. It is when the research and preferences meet that a 
              true sense of the maker&#8217;s intentions become clear. This is 
              especially evident in Peter&#8217;s work with glazes.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/peter_beard/image4115.jpg" width="510" height="192"></p>
            <p>He is a man who takes risks, glazes bubbling here and running there. 
              These risks have their dividend; the run of the glaze inform us 
              directly of the subtle curves of a form, as gravity takes an opportune 
              moment to intervene before being frozen as the kiln cools. The blisters 
              represent a meeting of the two opposing glazes along a boundary 
              defined by the makers hand; a pattern being too crude a word to 
              articulate the juxtaposition of these two volcanic forces. It is 
              Peter's combination of research, risk taking and self-criticism 
              that enables him to keep up his fearless standard, right to the 
              edge of what even he thinks possible.</p>
            <p>Peter is aware of historical ceramic precedents, the ancient art 
              of Egypt is a touchstone for a lot of his recent work. He is no 
              imitator though, and his work is a personal reinvention of the past, 
              at once contemporary yet imbued with an archaic authority.</p>
            <p>This reinvention is born of Peter&#8217;s approach to his work. 
              He sees himself as firstly a maker. It is by making that ideas reveal 
              themselves and are refined. The act of making distils Peter&#8217;s 
              experiences, be they a favourite landscape or a pre-Raphelite painting. 
              The results bear no direct lineage to any one precedent, but they 
              are a pretty potent brew.</p>
            <p> In Peter Beard's work the trinity of process, material and concept 
              are so closely woven that it is almost impossible to tease them 
              apart. Peter's ability to twist such tightly spun cloth shows his 
              immense skill and determination. The end results speak clearly of 
              the potter himself. It is no surprise that his pots have garnered 
              such acclaim.</p>
