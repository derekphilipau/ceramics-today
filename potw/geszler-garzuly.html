              ceramist Maria Geszler-Garzuly completed her studies at the Academy 
              of Art and Craft in Budapest in 1965. She worked as an industrial 
              designer between 1966-80, setting up her own studio in 1975. Geszler-Garzuly 
              has become widely known for her humanoid bottle shapes, onto which 
              she transfers surface designs and which are then salt-glazed. She 
              has won several awards, including the international competition 
              'Salt-glazed Ceramics' in 1993, a bronze medal at the Mino International 
              Ceramics Award in 2003 and a bronze medal at the Taipei Ceramics 
              Award in 2004.

            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p> &quot;Portraits - china portraits - as my diaries - for decades 
              I have experimented to express my own personality in simple, concentrated 
              &quot;minimal art&quot; form (technical difficulties, too big forms 
              for china, high temperature (1300C), wood heated killn, saltglaze) 
              and with glowing contents (Poetry of industrial landscape, Rousseau's 
              garden, Lonely bank, Blue bush etc). 
            <p> These figures I imagine living in the landscape, hiding in a bush, 
              lying in the grass, standing in water. In the exhibition hall, on 
              plinths, I see a dissonant phenomenon. 
            <ol>
              <li> That's why I tried to put them on ceramic &quot;stones&quot; 
                or to build half of them in stone-forms - so that they may return 
                to nature even in these sterile surroundings.</li>
              <li> A new formal problem started to excite me - the contradiction 
                of hard and soft, natural and constructed.</li>
              <li> And referring to the contents: the unrevelling cloudy ideas. 
                How to create an object out of sculpture born within us? How had 
                these happened before? Michelangelo went to Carrara and was standing 
                in the quarry in the glowing heat - finally he pointed at the 
                marble rock at the side of the mountain and said &quot;that's 
                my David&quot;. </li>
            </ol>
            <p> He implanted his perfect vision of David into the amorph marble 
              rock or otherwise the white gleaming marble formed Michelangelo's 
              spirit?<br>
              Thus I feel my way towards the surrealistic transformation of stones 
              and statues, china stones, not heavier than some grams, egg-shell 
              white with sieved pictures. But what kind of pictures?

            <p><a href="images/geszler-garzuly1.jpg"><img src="images/geszler-garzuly1_sm.gif" alt="Maria Geszler-Garzuly" width="108" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>I 
              am from Eastern Europe, the daughter of a ideological and social 
              experiment gone wrong - socialism. 
            <p> Having graduated at the College of Applied Art's in Budapest, 
              I started to work as designer in a pure, neglected &quot;out of 
              the world&quot; ceramic factory. 
            <p> But what a factory? 
            <p> From this time on I started to feel the smoke of the cooling towers, 
              the lines of the factory's broken windows, the conveyer belts, the 
              women metal-workers with their varicose legs, the electricity centers, 
              the crane-cemetery and the loneliness of the huge, badly lit factory 
              halls. The poles, the bottom of aeroplanes, the sky red from poisonous 
              gas, had a special meaning for me. I started to photograph these 
              impressions and transfered them on via sieves onto china, I formed 
              and crumpled them together with the material. 
            <p> I was lead by two feelings: adoration and horror. Admiration and 
              appreciation at the sight of human spirit and technique and fear 
              and anxiety at the sight of those huge, isolated, creaking steel 
              plants. 
            <p> What will the future hold?
