              British ceramist <b><a href="http://www.halimacassell.co.uk/">Halima 
              Cassell</a></b> graduated from the University of Lancashire with 
              a BA in 1997 and an MA in 3D Design in 2002. Her deeply carved, 
              large-scale, contoured sculptural vessels are made from a heavily 
              grogged, unglazed clay and are inspired by Islamic and African art 
              and architectural geometry. Cassell utilises dramatic lines and 
              angles in an attempt to manifest the universal language of numbers. 
              Her awards include an East Lancashire Creativity Development Award 
              and a Craft Council Development Award, both in 2005.

            <p><b>Artist Statement</b></p>
            <p>Where does my pre-occupation with carved form spring from? What 
              are the roots of my fascination with carved space? These all-embracing 
              obsessions of bringing into being the poetry of faceted forms are 
              my creations.</p>
            <p>They are buried in layers of forgotten history, like subcutaneous 
              memories waiting to be plumbed; like the ocean deep they float in 
              darkness waiting to be revealed by the light. I carve out parts 
              of my history, an exorcism of thought forms, a compulsion to make 
              manifest the intangible, transmuting it into something hard and 
              permanent. Like life everything begins with the energy of a thought.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Crystaline.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Crystaline.jpg" width="222" height="180" border="0"></a><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Citadel.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Citadel.jpg" width="206" height="180" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>My forms are energetic expressions of my psyche linking two cultures, 
              like left and right hemispheres of the brain; logic and reason married 
              to irrationality in order to formulate a style of working. Like 
              slightly shifting sands my work refuses to stand still.</p>
            <p>I want my work to be on the edge of reason yet speaking with an 
              eloquence that is understood by the universal consciousness &#8211; 
              altered states yet accessible tectonic plates in dialogue, setting 
              up tensions, the &#8216;Ley Lines&#8217; of my world made visible 
              within the forms and folds of my beloved earth.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Converse_Petals.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Converse_Petals.jpg" width="194" height="180" border="0"></a><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Chain_of_Diamonds.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Chain_of_Diamonds.jpg" width="216" height="180" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Artists in general create their own mood and feeling through the 
              use of colour, line and texture in their work, I try to do the same 
              through my pieces but through playfully manipulating the planes 
              and facets of the pattern, one against the other. This juxtaposition 
              helps me to create the maximum impact within the overall design. 
              The most exciting moment for me is when my flat designs become dramatically 
              transformed when charted over a structure taking on a different 
              life. The hue of the clay body is crucial because I rarely use glazes, 
              I solely rely on the piece itself to dramatise the tones and textures 
              through the effects of light, shadow and rain.</p>
            <p>In my early work I was exploring the boundaries of my new found 
              &#8216;modus operandi&#8217;, which was infused with Islamic influences 
              drawn from heavily carved architecture. This led me to look to other 
              examples of intricately carved and constructed buildings from all 
              around the world. In addition, I was inspired by the repetitive 
              motifs of pattern derived from the influences of African surface 
              design.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Celestial_Star.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Celestial_Star.jpg" width="224" height="180" border="0"></a><a href="images/Halima_Cassell/Mancunian_Roofscape.jpg"><img src="images/Halima_Cassell/thumbs/Mancunian_Roofscape.jpg" width="210" height="180" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>My recent work has been influenced by the structures of past and 
              contemporary building styles. I was intrigued by internal space 
              and construction, which are articulated together on the external 
              surface envelope. These relationships have informed my own work 
              as I strive to unify not only internal and external forms but also 
              the parts to the whole. In this respect I am reminded of the Greek 
              principle of the Golden Section, namely that, &#8216;the smaller 
              is to the larger as the larger is to the whole&#8217;.</p>
            <p>Over the past year, my new work has been conceived as a direct 
              result of being attentive to observations and comments of visitors 
              to my work. There appeared to be a distinct pattern of behaviour 
              of the viewers emerging solely based on gender. In general, women 
              gravitated towards the spherical forms whereas the square form tended 
              to elicit more interest from men. Drawing from these observations 
              my new work consists of the same design elements but with a novel 
              emphasis on the balance between masculine and feminine forms.</p>
