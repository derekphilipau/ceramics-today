              has become known for her figurative porcelain sculpture, mainly 
              of the female figure. Each work is a sensitive character study. 
            <p>Dietz studied ceramics and sculpture under Professor Leinfellner 
              at the University of Applied Art in Vienna from 1965&#8211;70. She 
              has also worked with the Viennese Porcelain Manufactory in Augarten. 
              She has won several prizes, including an &#8216;Honorary Silver 
              Needle&#8217;, awarded by the Province of Lower Austria and in 2001 
              was awarded the title &#8216;Professor&#8217;, by the Office of 
              the Chancellor of Austria. She has been a member of the International 
              Academy of Ceramics since 1993.

            <p>Few artists succeed in achieving an unmistakably independent style 
              in figurative porcelain. Dietz has succeeded in developing such 
              a style, in the process establishing her own making techniques.

              <i>Zillie</i>
            <p>Her technical skills point towards her preference for the material 
              porcelain, with which she creates her unique figures - standing, 
              lying or sitting up. Her work revolves around the female figure 
              in her most natural form - naked, or semi-naked - but never seductive, 
              rather natural and humorous. Dietz also makes <a href="http://www.gundi-dietz.at/tierskulpturen.html"><b>animal 
              figures</b></a> and has been involved in <a href="http://www.gundi-dietz.at/outdoor.html"><b>public 
              commissions</b></a>.

            <p align="left"><b>Artist's Statement</b> 
            <p align="left"><i>Zillie</i> is a spiritual vessel. A discourse with 
              beauty and life's misunderstandings. I had a vision of a simple 
              sculptural form. Strong and energetic. She was looking at her thoughts 
              running through her fingers. While building and assembling her, 
              my vision intensified, the picture in the mind's eye took form. 
            <p align="left">From the variety of my ideas, the sculpture was reduced 
              to its essence. This reduction of form, motion and color is central 
              to my work. <i>Zillie</i> is in various stages of transition, of 
              peeling and shedding skin, smoothing, tearing, all became central. 
              <i>She</i> showed me, where she wanted to go. 
            <p align="left">During this process of development, iIt takes semsibility 
              to hone in on the <i>inner picture</i>. The material is seductive 
              and technical problems loom large. I have to go into a meditatative 
              and concentrated state to stop my visions from running amok. After 
              the inner struggle, I am in agreement with my creation, which I 
              have brought to life via various processes. Now I can be amazed 
              at these immortal beings that move us. This is a wonderful process.
            <p align="left">The studio is as if a crime scene. Again and again, 
              I am drawn there, right into the work. Add to that the natural rythym, 
              dictated by the nature of the living, breathing material - porcelain. 
              I can't just leave work sitting there, once started. Here is a concentrated 
              energy that has to be brought to its conclusion.
            <p align="left">With <i>Zillie</i>, this process took several weeks. 
              It was an exciting and happy time. <i>Zillie</i> was an instant 
              success. She was pliable, she adapted to my needs. It is always 
              a challenge to find the right balance between sensitive and strong, 
              light and dark, soft and hard, smooth and rough. One little slip 
              while incising a line and the balance may be lost.
            <p align="left"><i>She</i> is like a soul map you can read, but leaves 
              plenty to the imagination. <i>She</i> is authentic. I love <i>her</i>.
