                Look a Gift Shoppe in the Mouth&quot; intones the inscription 
                on one of Seattle artist <a href="http://antiquesatoz.com/artatoz/krafft/index.html"><b>Charles
                Krafft</b></a>&#8217;s porcelain collector plates. So, it should 
                come as no surprise that the creator of delft <a href="http://antiquesatoz.com/artatoz/krafft/delft.html"><b>Disasterware</b></a><sup><font size=-1>tm</font></sup>
                took advantage of a gift -- in the form of a grant jointly administered 
                by the NEA, the Citizens Exchange Council, and the Soros Foundation 
                -- to travel to the battle-scarred remains of the former Yugoslavia. 
                His diplomatic mission to the Balkans was the topic of discussion 
                at the February installment of Reflex magazine&#8217;s superb 
                Third Tuesday presentations at the Two Bells Tavern.</p>
              <p align="left">Krafft has toiled for years in obscurity as a painter 
                and writer in the Northwest, earning himself the dubious distinction 
                of being &quot;The oldest promising young artist in Seattle.&quot; 
                Five years ago he joined a guild of lady china painters and acquired 
                the skills to launch a line of hand painted disasters in delft. 
                His career has since taken off like the space shuttle Challenger. 
                &quot;Collector plates are something we&#8217;ve all seen in souvenir 
                shops, or advertised in the back pages of supermarket tabloids 
                and Sunday papers&quot;, Krafft explains.<i>&quot;</i>After wading 
                through the usual swill of bad news and lurid gossip, you can 
                usually find one of those limited editions of a maudlin portrait 
                or a rhapsodic pastoral scene to send away for. But you never 
                find the pictures of the gritty life most of us are living in 
                the late 20th century on ornamental china because no one would 
                want to hang it on their walls<i>, </i>much less eat off it<i>&quot;.</i></p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/krafft4.jpg" alt="Delft handgrenades by Charlie Krafft" width="355" height="199"></p>
               
              <p align="left">While that may be true for many people, a growing 
                number of adventurous patrons soon discovered the twisted irony 
                of his Disasterware <sup><font size=1>tm</font></sup>; resulting 
                in a burgeoning international reputation for this often overlooked 
                Northwest master. His plates debuted at the Davidson Galleries 
                in 1991, and much to the artist&#8217;s surprise, they were instantly 
                snapped up by some of Seattle&#8217;s most prestigious collectors. 
                Following a few more successful shows in the Northwest, including 
                a &quot;Metropolitan Mobile Museum&quot; show mounted in the back 
                of a traveling semi-truck, Krafft turned to the traditional method 
                of marketing these curios, creating a mail order catalog that 
                he sent to dealers across the country. The response was phenomenal. 
                He was commissioned to create a series of plates commemorating 
                the tragic relationship between the late Sinclair Lewis and Dorothy 
                Thompson for permanent display at their former Vermont estate, 
                now a bed and breakfast inn. The catalog also generated interest 
                among some of America's most prominent galleries, and led to a 
                one person exhibit at the Garth Clark Gallery in New York. His 
                work was included in a traveling exhibit of printed pottery, and 
                slated for display at the London Crafts Council.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/krafft2.jpg" alt="Watercolor by Charlie Krafft" width="281" height="197"></p>
               
              <p align="left"> Krafft's quirky sensibilities eventually came to 
                the attention of an equally eccentric group of artists in the 
                former Yugoslav Federation. Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) is a 
                Slovenian artists collective whose activities were inspired by 
                the Socialists regime&#8217;s banishment in 1983 of the provocative 
                Slovenian industrial rock band Laibach. In response to the government 
                edict, a group of young artists, actors, designers and writers 
                collectively called what their activities Laibach Kunst, to keep 
                the name of the band before the public. As Laibach achieved international 
                acclaim, they became a source of national pride, and the ban was 
                grudgingly lifted after four years. The rebellious collective 
                then became known as NSK.
              <p align="left">NSK contains several diverse elements: LAIBACH, 
                the Music Department; IRWIN, the Painting Department; a Theater 
                Department known as NOORDUNG; NEW COLLECTIVISM Graphics; and the 
                Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy. In accordance with 
                the Eastern European trend of the time, NSK formally declared 
                itself an autonomous transglobal state in 1993, complete with 
                their own passports, currency, postage stamps, diplomats and embassies. 
                To date, embassies have been established in Moscow, Ghent, Berlin, 
                Venice and most recently, Sarajevo. The primary purpose of Kraftt's 
                residency with the group was to help create commemorative china 
                for use at official NSK embassy functions and state occasions. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/krafft5.jpg" alt="Disasterware platter by Charlie Krafft" width="207" height="163" align="left">Krafft 
                was on hand for the declaration of an NSK State Territory in Sarajevo 
                where Laibach performed two free concerts at the National Theater 
                of Bosnia coinciding with the announcement from the U.S. of the 
                Dayton Peace Accords. The activities included an art exhibition, 
                computer links to the NSK Electronic Embassy in Tokyo, and the 
                issuance of 300 passports. As Krafft observed: <i>&quot;</i>Keeping 
                culture alive in a situation that severe becomes a means of sharing 
                in the dignity of purpose that is the real spirit of art after 
                its pretensions are all stripped away. NSK delivered a musical 
                and conceptual payload that couldn't have been more perfect for 
                that time and place. They turned the city&#8217;s trauma into 
                a laboratory where the audience, without being patronized for 
                its plight, was invited to engineer its own understanding of the 
                multi-media event they were participating in. Outside the theater, 
                the world media voraciously harvested sound bites from war victims 
                about the news from Dayton. Inside, new citizens of an alternative 
                mental territory were busy digging the loaded irony of Laibach&#8217;s 
                techno deconstruction of Serbian army anthems<i>&quot;.</i></p>
              <p align="left"> The effect of this event on Krafft was profound. 
                <i>&quot;</i>The people of Sarajevo were so isolated. It renewed 
                my faith in art as a means of connecting people to contemporary 
                culture<i>&quot;.</i> </p>

                used the occasion of his talk at the Two Bells to announce that 
                the NSK painters group and three Russian guests will visit Seattle 
                this summer for a summit meeting. As part of Atlanta's international 
                Cultural Olympiad, the group will travel in two RVs to New York, 
                Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle. They plan to engage local 
                artists, writers and philosophers from different cultural and 
                political backgrounds along the way in discussions and actions 
                which will be linked by computer to their exhibitions in Atlanta 
                and Rotterdam. The event entitled TRANSNACIONALA promises to provide 
                an important forum for a collaborative exchange with this extraordinary 
                group of visionaries.</p>
