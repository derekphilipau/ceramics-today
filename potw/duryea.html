              ceramist Lynn Duryea is known for her minimalist sculpture, incorporating 
              references to architectural, mechanical and industrial elements.
            <p>Duryea had already been a studio-artist in Maine for over 20 years 
              before earning an MFA from the University of Florida in 2002. In 
              1986 she co-founded the <a href="http://www.watershedcenterceramicarts.org/"><b>Watershed 
              Center for the Ceramic Arts</b></a> in Newcastle, Maine, where she 
              was Program Coordinator and Artist-in-Residence for the Watershed 
              Workshop for People with HIV/AIDS from 1992&#8211;2004. 
            <p>She taught at the Sam Houston State University in Texas in 2003 
              and accepted a tenured position as Assistant Professor of Art, Appalachian 
              State University in Boone, North Carolina in 2004. 
            <p align="center"><a href="images/duryea/duryea3.jpg"><img src="images/duryea/thumbs/duryea3.jpg" width="100" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/duryea/duryea2.jpg"><img src="images/duryea/thumbs/duryea2.jpg" width="95" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/duryea/duryea4.jpg"><img src="images/duryea/thumbs/duryea4.jpg" width="101" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a>
            <p>Duryea was also a co-founder of the Sawyer Street Studios, an artist-owned 
              ceramic facility in South Portland, Maine. In 1998 she received 
              Portland, Maine&#8217;s YWCA Women of Achievement Award, the first 
              visual artist to do so. 
            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b> 
            <p> The ordinary is quite extraordinary. Through elemental shape and 
              form, my reference is to architectural and mechanical elements as 
              well as large scale industrial objects and sites. The representation 
              of function is in an allusive and enigmatic sense, suggestive of 
              the past. The objects are evocative of abandoned sites of human 
              activity, generating feelings of melancholy and stillness. 
            <p>When viewed from a distance, these objects present insistent profile 
              and reductive form, images of simplicity and stillness. Closer consideration 
              reveals a sense of history, traces of transformation that generate 
              narratives of accretion and deterioration. Surfaces are generated 
              by means of building up and wearing away, a layering and removal 
              of materials that implies processes occurring over time, suggesting 
              previous use and depicting the effects of decay, erosion and weathering.</p>

            <p>Through a vocabulary of form of softened geometry, I investigate 
              subtlety and nuance, and the method and manner of connection. Simplicity 
              and clarity function as an expression, and as an invitation to contemplate 
              the complexity and richness that can exist in the apparently straightforward. 
              Subtle shifts and changes, seeing images from slightly differing 
              angles and views, lends a depth to the consideration of objects. 
            </p>
            <p>Transition zones, borders, places where one reality shifts to another, 
              are compelling in their quiet drama. Great energy exists along an 
              edge. I grew up in a small town on the extreme end of Long Island, 
              New York, knowing the feeling of a littoral, a place where land 
              stopped and seemingly endless water began. Land and the landscape 
              have been encountered in visceral as well as visual ways. The nature 
              and essence of the feelings generated by a particular place are 
              as inspiring to me as the structure and color of land, buildings 
              and vegetation.<br>
              <br>
              Joy in the physicality of constructing is part of what compels me 
              to create objects. I am interested in how structure as well as the 
              methods of construction and assembly can become part of the visual 
              language of an object. More than serving a compositional function, 
              for me these elements become part of a record of making, connections 
              in time as well as material.</p>
