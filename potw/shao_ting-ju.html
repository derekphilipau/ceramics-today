            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p><img src="images/shao/Shao_Ting-Ju.jpg" alt="Portrait" width="71" height="70" align="left">&quot;Being 
              a participant in this universe, I have been asking these questions 
              ever since my younger days; Why was I born? Why am I here? For the 
              very reason that I am strongly interested in our species, my work 
              in ceramics has always used the sculpting of human figures to reflect 
              the artists concepts. 
            <p>I recorded a single shape to explore the suffering and imprisonment 
              of souls and bodies, as well as the desire to free the minds. Using 
              different combinations of clay figures, I demonstrate the tension, 
              hostility and dependence of people with their society, as with the 
              harmonious or destructive relationship between man and nature. Enlarging 
              the limbs of the human figures is to project a freeze frame record 
              of the environment and myself. It is a continuous recording of my 
              realization of my position in this universe, what I touched and 
              what I saw. Recently, I became very interested in the destination 
              of souls and have tried to explore this.</p>
            <p>According to the bible, God created the image of man from earth. 
              Every individual is thus unique and precious. My ceramic works are 
              all handmade, whether they be an individual figure, or hundreds 
              of birds, or indeed anything else. Each piece retains its own uniqueness 
              while they may share an overall similarity. I have chosen wood fired 
              kilns whenever possible wherever I travel. During firing, my work 
              was placed in the Noborigama or Anagram at random, with some pleasant 
              surprises in the result. This reflects the fact that we cannot choose 
              our sex, race or nationality in advance when we are born. Each element 
              is unique, this constitutes the universe and the nature of our existence.</p>
            <p><a href="images/shao/Shao_Ting-Ju2.jpg"><img src="images/shao/Shao_Ting-Ju2_sm.jpg" alt="At Chopin`s funeral, I heard Mozart's requiem-2" width="239" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>In 
              recent years, people have abused the resources in this world. A 
              lot of damages have been done to nature, and that resulted in a 
              lot of disasters of magnitude. This is a warning signaled by Mother 
              Nature to us. For this very reason, the exhibition in Kyoto, Japan, 
              2002, was meant to be a reflection of the respective relationship 
              between nature and us, with birds representing Mother Nature. For 
              a bird that is manifested to 100 centimeters, and a human figure 
              shrink to 10 centimeters, their relative ratio is a reminder for 
              us who are the guests passing this world. The work was titled &quot; 
              The Seventy-Seven Gentle Warnings', and its theme was represented 
              by seventy-seven birds positioned in a circle around the small human 
              figure in the middle. The number seventy-seven is taken from the 
              bible, in which Jesus once told Peter to forgive seventy-seven times. 
              Effectively, it is telling us to be generous in our forgiveness, 
              which is what Mother Nature has been to us as well.</p>
            <p>'Meeting the beautiful green light of the universe &quot;is another 
              work, represented by a human figure of 68 centimeters. He was looking 
              at the small Angel positioned in the middle of his palm with a mutual 
              understanding. Only when people can understand this intricacy of 
              wonders created by God, and through his own humbling, then we can 
              achieve a balance in the geo-cycle with Mother Cycle.</p>
            <p>For the past 18 years, the clay figures always took on a small 
              head with a fat body. The toes protruding from underneath. This 
              is a reflection of the greed in this polluted world, people have 
              lost their innocence, and all the efforts were used to think of 
              obtaining small advantages. The size of the head became relatively 
              small in this disproportion of energy. Yet, the toes are a remainder 
              of the true nature of ourselves, one that cannot be hidden and should 
              be drawn back into focus.</p>
            <p><a href="images/shao/Shao_Ting-Ju5.jpg"><img src="images/shao/Shao_Ting-Ju5_sm.jpg" alt="The solo exhibition at Maronia gallery, Kyoto, Japan,2002" width="117" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              use of multimedia is also a reflection of the contrast between material 
              substance and the concept of time, just as the physical existence 
              and the time of existence of all life on earth. The final disappearance 
              of the physical body mirrors the fact that one day, the ceramic 
              bird or figure can also be broken. The use of iron and wooden frame 
              denotes the eternity of time. The use of feathers, which could represent 
              the feather on the back of the angels, or the little wings on the 
              angles; in turn draws on the symbolic representation of our faith 
              in trust, hope and aspiration. While there are something in this 
              universe which does not take on a physical form, our faith will 
              remain the striving force that seek to maintain a balance with the 
              universe.</p>
            <p>The title of the work also constitutes an important poetic element; 
              it is in itself like a narrative poem, revealing the in-depth meaning 
              of the ceramic art.&quot;</p>
