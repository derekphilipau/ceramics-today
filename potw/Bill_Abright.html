            <p>Abright&#8217;s sculptures are constructed post-firing by combining 
              related elements with adhesives into a cohesive whole, and are finished 
              with a variety of media, including glaze, steel, paint and pencil.

                  <p><b>Artists Statement</b> 
                  <p>Art should represent the leap as well as the landing of an 
                    idea. My best work doesn&#8217;t know its end in the beginning. 
                    The urge to create has always been a part of me and the ability 
                    of clay to record impressions and accept a variety of input 
                    resonates with my fingertips. The process of firing this once 
                    soft mass to permanence draws me to it like a moth to a primal 
                    flame. After working in clay for 34 years I like the feel 
                    of it more than ever.</p>
                  <p> As an art student I thought I would be a painter, but after 
                    two years of exploring mediums at Delta College I started 
                    focusing on ceramics. I finished my education at San Francisco 
                    State in the early 70&#8217;s working on large nature inspired 
                    vessel forms. Now I merge mediums as needed to complete my 
                    work with clay, glaze, steel, paint and pencil. I have pioneered 
                    the technique of post-fired constructed ceramic sculpture 
                    by combining related elements with adhesives into a cohesive 
                    whole.</p>
                  <p>Inspired by the complexity of the natural world, acute observations 
                    of species are often my starting points. Paleobiology is fascinating 
                    to me and I take extinction very seriously. My most recent 
                    series of sculptures has focused on fish, insects and human 
                    figures. I merge the morphology of nature into my figurative 
                    work to communicate parallels with man&#8217;s existence, 
                    and I insert human contradictions among animal species to 
                    emphasize a link between their fate and ours.</p>

              process is one of exploring my own imagination. I will initiate 
              a form with deliberate intent; however, it is always the unexpected 
              discovery that I hope will occur. Clay surfaces are my canvases 
              yet my forms contain space and I open them up and use their interiors 
              to add complexity and depth. I am ever curious about what&#8217;s 
              inside and what makes things work. This investigation into the interior 
              of my figures parallels my own search for a better understanding 
              of myself.</p>
            <p> Creative realization often occurs when I&#8217;m not looking for 
              it as I seek balance in the activities of my life. I have made a 
              living teaching and making art. Having a family has expanded my 
              heart and deepened my empathy for mankind. Being active outdoors 
              has given me some profoundly beautiful experiences with nature. 
              I am lucky to have had moments of &#8220;Oneness.&#8221; I continue 
              to live and work in search of these moments. </p>
