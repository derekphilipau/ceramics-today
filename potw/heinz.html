              Heinz</a></b> originally trained as a painter at the academy of

              in Geneva from 1988-89 and at London Guildhall University from 1989-93. 
              She was awarded a Post-graduate Diploma by Goldsmith&#8217;s College, 
              London, in 1991 and an MA in Sculpture by the Wimbledon School of 
              Art in 1995. She has been a member of the * Craft Potters Association 
              since 1998. Regina makes hand-built, abstract sculpture, reliefs 
              and wall pieces decorated with colored glazes, *slips and oxides. 
              She cites as her inspiration the mountainous landscapes of her home 
              country Austria. 
            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b><br>
              Regina Heinz specialises in hand built ceramic art. Exploring the 
              malleability of wet clay, Regina has developed a special slab building 
              technique to create free standing ceramic sculptures and relief 
              pieces for wall hanging. 
            <p><a href="images/heinz1.jpg"><img src="images/heinz1_sm.jpg" alt="Sculpture by Regina Heinz - click to enlarge" width="220" height="170" border="0" align="left"></a>Slabs 
              are rolled out and then &quot;tailored&quot;: joined, pushed, folded, 
              stretched and incised until the piece has taken on it's final shape 
              and expression, yet the material has retained it's original softness 
              and surface texture. This technique is paramount to Regina's work 
              and requires spontaneity and control as the soft slabs react to 
              every touch and record every imprint of the hand.</p>
            <p>Originally trained in fine arts, painting still plays an important 
              part in the creation process. Vibrant primary colours are applied 
              over a base of neutral greys and whites to enhance the underlying 
              form. A Lithium glaze, slips, oxides and stains are brushed on in 
              thin layers and multiple firings add depth and intensity to the 
              coloured surface.</p>
            <p><a href="images/heinz2.jpg"><img src="images/heinz2_sm.jpg" alt="Sculpture by Regina Heinz - click to enlarge" width="134" height="109" border="0" align="left"></a>Regina 
              takes her inspiration from landscapes and surface details to create 
              pieces that are abstract but display an organic and sensual quality, 
              reminiscent of the undulating &quot;landscape&quot; of the body. 
              Geometry, grid patterns and repetition are used as a starting point 
              and combined with organic curves, softened and transformed by the 
              tactile quality of clay. The forms communicate volume and inner 
              space and have a powerful physical presence, gently distended, containing 
              and being contained. They are tender abstracts of body and mind.
