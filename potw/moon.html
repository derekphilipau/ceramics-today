              Milton</a></b> studied pottery at Sandison Pottery in Brisbane and 
              worked with Australian potter Harry Memmott in the late 1950s. He 
              was Senior Instructor in Pottery at Brisbane Technical College from 
              1962&#8211;68 and Head of the Pottery Department at the South Australian 
              School of Art from 1969&#8211;74. In 1966 he was the subject of 
              the monograph &#8216;Focus on Milton Moon&#8217;, by Dennis Pryor. 
            <p>Moon has received numerous awards, including a Foundation Churchill 
              Fellowship in 1966 (representing Australia at the 1st World Craft 
              Congress in Montreaux, Switzerland), a Myer Foundation Geijutsu 
              Fellowship to study in Japan in 1974, an Advance Australia Foundation 
              Award in 1992 and a five year Australian Artists Creative Fellowship 
              in 1993. In 1984 he was made a member of the Order of Australia 
              for services to the arts. Moon is well known for his large wheel-thrown 
              stoneware platters and vessels inspired by the Australian landscape.

            <p><a href="images/moon/062Platter.jpg"><img src="images/moon/thumbs/062Platter.jpg" width="124" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>In 
              this, my seventy-ninth year, over fifty of which I have been a potter, 
              I remain concerned, if a little obsessed, with the challenge of 
              making pots, which although belonging to a ceramic tradition of 
              some eight thousand years or more, are undeniably and uniquely Australian. 
              With all my changes of expression this has remained constant.<br>
              The initial creative inspirations were drawn from the beauty of 
              the coastal areas of Eastern Australia and from the mountain areas 
              of the Great Dividing Range which stretch from North Queensland 
              to the extreme South of Victoria. But the most lasting inspiration 
              has come from the inland of Australia, more particularly from the 
              Gammon and Flinders Ranges and from the Olary Uplands of South Australia, 
              and more recently from the Pilbara and Kimberley areas of Western 
              Australia, where dating of the rock engravings place them as being 
              amongst the oldest marks left by human-kind anywhere in the world.

            <p><a href="images/moon/140FloorPot%20.jpg"><img src="images/moon/thumbs/140FloorPot%20.jpg" width="99" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>All 
              parts of Australia are full of an ancient history stretching back 
              through time and which today, despite white settlement, somehow 
              still survives in legend and ritual. If it is the case that these 
              legends do now only exist, in some muted half-life there is still 
              the sense that they remain as a very powerful spirit presence. It 
              is impossible to ignore the feeling that this country re mains inhabited 
              by the past. For me it is also impossible not to creatively respond 
              to the echoes of the past, even if only through the somewhat vague 
              process of inspiration and distillation.<br>
              Whether one searches the horizons of these vast bare rugged lands 
              or views the far vistas from the great mountains of the High Country 
              the same spirit remains. To understand this spirit, even a little, 
              is a privilege but to try an express it is a compelling endeavor. 
              For me to be a truly Australian artist it is something that cannot 
              be ignored.</p>
