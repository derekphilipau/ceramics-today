            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b><br>

              As the poet economizes words, I have developed a similar means of 
              expression in the ceramic arts through the conservation of materials. 
              I believe that the aesthetic impact of a work of art is not proportional 
              to its size, but to its content. It is not the objects created which 
              are of prime importance, but the lives of people who may be touched 
              in significant ways.
            <p>Although the vast majority of my work created between 1983 and 
              1995 consists almost entirely of teapots, I consider myself a sculptor 
              with a strong commitment to social commentary. My chosen medium 
              &#8212; the material I love to work with &#8212; is clay. The vessel 
              is the primal &quot;canvas&quot; for the ceramic artist, and my 
              vessel of choice is the teapot, the most complex of vessels, consisting 
              of body, handle, spout, lid and knob. This allows me the widest 
              latitude in juxtaposing the many images I use to set up my narrative 
              pieces.
            <p align="center"><a href="images/notkin/gift.jpg"><img src="images/notkin/thumbs/gift.jpg" alt="The Gift" width="230" height="165" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/notkin/notkin3.jpg"><img src="images/notkin/thumbs/notkin3.jpg" alt="Yixing teapot" width="239" height="165" hspace="2" border="0"></a>
            <p>In addition, the teapot is a universally recognized object, with 
              strong associations to domesticity and tranquility. As such, it 
              is a &quot;hook&quot; to lure the viewer &#8212; who must then decipher 
              the narrative imagery &#8212; in a sort of bait-and-switch fashion. 
              The conveying of tea is secondary to the not-so-hidden message in 
              my &quot;teapots&quot;. In addition to examining our many human 
              follies, these teapots pay homage to the teapots of Yixing, China. 
              I was first attracted to the Yixing teapots' small scale, attention 
              to detail, and wide range of imagery; I later became a student of 
              their remarkable sense of proportion and composition, as well as 
              their symbolism and narrative qualities. In creating my teapots, 
              I strive to avoid being a mere copyist. Although I closely imitate 
              the scale, formats, colors and textures of the unglazed Yixing teapots, 
              my intention is to borrow from these formal qualities with honesty 
              and a sense of homage. It is of utmost importance, however, that 
              my teapots retain a totally separate cultural identity, that they 
              reflect our contemporary civilization's imagery and speak of our 
              current situations as we emerge from the 20th century into the 21st.
            <p>The pieces in the &quot;Heart Teapot&quot; series explore the origins 
              of conflict in human culture &#8212; both the collective conflicts 
              between various nations, ethnic groups, religions, etc., and those 
              inherent in relationships between individuals. The seeds of all 
              conflict are to be found in each human heart. Such pieces as &quot;Heart 
              Teapot: Hiroshima&quot;, &quot;Heart Teapot: Beirut&quot;, and &quot;Heart 
              Teapot: Salvador&quot; were created to commemorate specific instances 
              of the human species' dark side, but the message of each piece is 
              intended to outlive its respective moment in history. The spirit 
              and power of art are exemplified by a work of art's ability to transcend 
              time and cultural boundaries. 
            <p><b>20th Century Solutions</b><br>

              <a href="images/notkin/notkin2.jpg"><img src="images/notkin/thumbs/notkin2.jpg" alt="20th Century Solutions" width="234" height="165" border="0" align="left"></a>My 
              most recent works in the <i>20th Century Solutions Teapot</i> series 
              were conceived in late 2000.I began the design drawings, prototype 
              models and mold fabrication early in 2001. Although the first work 
              was nearing completion, the tragic events of September 11 paralyzed 
              my creative spirit for some time. I decided to halt work on this 
              series, as the imagery seemed too painful. After a few days, and 
              with the encouragement of Phoebe Toland, my wife, I decided that 
              the message of the piece was perhaps more pertinent now than ever, 
              and that it certainly needed to be seen. 
            <p>The titles, such as <i>It Will Be the Same</i>, <i>And It Can't 
              Be Helped</i>, <i>Nobody Knows Why</i>, and <i>With or Without Reason</i>, 
              are titles of individual etchings from the <i>Disasters of War</i> 
              series by the great Francisco Goya. My pieces are meant to be a 
              contemporary reinterpretation of these themes, and to pay homage 
              to Goya's work. 
            <p>The concept behind the <i>20th Century Solutions Teapot</i> series 
              is, quite simply, that the armed conflict solutions of the 20th 
              Century are no longer viable. We have entered the 21st Century with 
              the technologies of 'Star Wars' and the emotional maturity of cavemen, 
              a very dangerous combination. The problems of human civilization 
              are far too complex to be solved by means of explosive devices.
