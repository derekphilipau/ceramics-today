              <img src="images/delisle1.jpg" alt="Roseline Delisle" width="124" height="270" align="left">My 
              first encounter with the work of <a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Fire_Earth/Artists/Delisle/DelisleBioEn.html"><b>Roseline 
              Delisle</b></a> was at the Frank Lloyd Gallery in the Bergamot Station 
              complex in Santa Monica, LA, where she was one of the artists in 
              a show entitled Contemporary Ceramics: Nine Artists, held in June, 
              2000. 
            <p>Delisle&#8217;s work immediately impressed me with its sense of 
              stylised colour and dizzy movement; its balance and precision; the 
              obvious skills with which she executes her work; her sense of proportion 
              and scale; her meticulous attention to detail and her neat problem-solving 
              solutions concerning minimising the real risk of the next &#8216;big&#8217; 
              earthquake shaker to her pots.</p>
            <p>Born in Rimouski, Qu&eacute;bec, in Canada, Delisle came from a 
              creative and art nurturing family environment, with a mother who 
              worked in clay as a hobby, and a father who sculpted wood part-time. 
              One of Delisle&#8217;s earliest memories was of the sound of her 
              father&#8217;s rhythmic chipping and watching the fine shavings 
              curling from his chisels. This she often recalls at her wheel in 
              her own work rhythms as she concentrates on the fine clay curls 
              that she turns from her finely-honed pieces.</p>
            <p>Influenced by an older brother with an interest in science, Delisle 
              originally thought her future lay in the fields of physics and chemistry, 
              but a visit to the nearby art school saw her enrolling at the Institute 
              of the Applied Arts, Montr&eacute;al, in 1969. In this old style 
              art school with a strict curriculum of technical learning, her 40 
              hours of study a week included a wide range of classes that encouraged 
              the broad use of materials and techniques. However, it was towards 
              the ceramics studio that she ultimately gravitated.</p>
            <p>Once established at her wheel, she started to explore the precise 
              thrown forms that have become her trademark, at that time in a coarse 
              stoneware, the colour and consistency of which thwarted her desire 
              for the finesse that even then she was seeking to achieve. For Delisle 
              to attempt to throw finely with a coarse stoneware on a kick wheel 
              says something for the tenacity and wilfulness of this artist in 
              her pursuit of perfection, and it wasn&#8217;t until a friend introduced 
              her to the seductive stuff of porcelain that she started to make 
              progress.</p>
            <p>After graduating from college in 1973, Delisle travelled to the 
              Gasp&eacute; Peninsula for an apprenticeship with ceramist, Enid 
              LeGros. In Cree Indian, Gasp&eacute; means &#8216;edge of the world&#8217; 
              which is exactly where Delisle felt she was. In her early 20s, she 
              was living and working in a cabin in relative isolation, making 
              finely-thrown and striped porcelain bowls which she was selling 
              for meagre profit in Montr&eacute;al.</p>
            <p>She eventually found the isolation and the Qu&eacute;becois winters 
              too hard to take, and was persuaded by friends to go south and join 
              them in their studio. Making delicately banded and scratched work 
              and selling them at small local fairs, she says that these were 
              still her &#8216;granola days&#8217;. Not profiting enough from 
              her labours, living frugally, with no electricity and no running 
              water, she left the studio in 1977, in debt. She joined a group 
              of men friends who were on their way to Alberta to work as lumberjacks, 
              not knowing what to expect but desperate enough to try anything 
              to regain solvency.</p>
            <p>Delisle learnt how to use a chainsaw, lumber jacking with her male 
              fellows. As French Canadians &#8211; Delisle spoke no English at 
              this time &#8211; the group was given one of the toughest assignments 
              with the most basic of camps. However, Delisle&#8217;s childhood 
              experience of family summer house building with her father, saw 
              her shouldering her chainsaw with the best of them and, despite 
              her slight frame, she endured sub-zero temperatures to make enough, 
              in a matter of months, to repay her debts and enable her to move 
              on.</p>
            <p>Yearning for warmer climes, Delisle then decided to travel south, 
              arriving in California in 1978. At this time, she set up her first 
              studio in Venice, where she established her reputation by having 
              a number of small studio sales, and catching the eye of such gallery 
              directors as Garth Clark. She now lives and works in her current 
              studio in Santa Monica, with husband, the painter, Bruce Cohen, 
              and their seven year old daughter, Lili.</p>
            <p>Both technical and formal concerns have informed and continue to 
              inform Delisle&#8217;s work. Her signature forms have evolved slowly 
              over many years as a natural process of working in components on 
              the wheel. Gaining in confidence and skill, she gradually developed 
              her techniques; inverting and stacking together pieces as a natural 
              way to achieve larger scale, and increasing their precariousness 
              by introducing impossible bases. As in her earlier work, decoration 
              still comprises banding coloured slips (with a little added gum 
              to harden the colours during handling in kiln packing) on to the 
              burnished leather-hard pots while they revolve quickly on the wheel. 
              This she does by eye with pinpoint accuracy and a steady hand, to 
              achieve the calculated negative spaces between the coloured stripes. 
              The fired pots are then polished to a fine sheen then coated with 
              a light mixture of turpentine and melted bees wax. The turpentine, 
              when it evaporates, leaves behind a fine film of wax that protects 
              the finished piece.</p>
            <p>For many years, since her college days, her vocabulary of form 
              and colour has been coaxed patiently from her chosen medium of porcelain. 
              The nature of the medium itself was such that Delisle was so seduced 
              by its sensuality during the making process that she lived with 
              the frustrations of the deformities that resulted from the ensuing 
              high temperature firings. For 25 years she continued the struggle 
              trying to make her forms defy high temperature kiln gravity, claiming 
              her stubbornness was due to her endurance of past Canadian winters. 
              When scale started to become a major philosophical issue, Delisle 
              reluctantly decided to give up the battle with the material that 
              she loved and moved to earthenware in order that her work could 
              move forwards.</p>
            <p><img src="images/delisle2.jpg" alt="Roseline Delisle" width="140" height="253" align="left">In 
              the exhibition Colour and Fire: Defining Moments in Studio Ceramics, 
              1950&#8211;2000 at the Los Angeles County Museum and Art, Peter 
              Voulkos states a similar love affair with clay that Delisle feels; 
              that of having to &quot;feel it in my fingers. Then it gets into 
              my body, and the invisible becomes visible &#8211; sound, movement, 
              colour, pattern. All these things are coming from my fingertips 
              like a dancer, I&#8217;ve got to be moving, everything comes out 
              of movement.&quot; However, it is Delisle&#8217;s latest forms, 
              her larger scale works (also included in the same show) that really 
              start to become &#8216;like a dancer&#8217;.</p>
            <p>An illustration of Delisle&#8217;s transition into movement can 
              be seen in the works that represent her in the Colour and Fire show; 
              two earlier pieces, Quadruple 3 (1990), made in porcelain, and 8=1 
              (1997), made in earthenware, illustrate her development in recent 
              times. Looking closely at Quadruple 3, one can&#8217;t help noticing 
              the tiny spiral at the top of its blue, black and white striped 
              lid section, a reminder of the &#8216;memory&#8217; that the porcelain 
              had of its throwing; a tiny, defiant &#8216;unravelling&#8217; of 
              the form during firing. Minute as this is, the larger frustrations 
              that this represents in her efforts to manage her materials and 
              firing procedures in her pursuit for ever more daring dancing forms, 
              one can understand the switch to earthenware. Just such an example 
              stands nearby; 8=1 is more than a metre high on its plinth, the 
              solid black of its body shimmering dully and in stark contrast to 
              the immaculate lines of white strips on its plate-like top. As one 
              moves around the piece, the stripes appear to revolve slightly in 
              the opposite direction in one&#8217;s peripheral vision &#8211; 
              a disturbing and intriguing sensation; as unnerving as a Bridget 
              Riley painting, but a sensation that Delisle would delight in causing.</p>
            <p>Having also just seen in the same day an exhibition of the work 
              of Charles and Ray Eames where, among the universal classics of 
              pre-formed plywood furniture, was a gem of a film called Tops. One 
              of the many films made by the pair, Tops featured children (and 
              grown ups) spinning an enormous variety of different coloured and 
              shaped tops that they had collected from around the world, to demonstrate 
              to students the physics of rotational movement. Seeing these whirling 
              striped forms, and experiencing the disturbance to my equilibrium 
              with Delisle&#8217;s 8=1, it is hardly surprising that Kristine 
              McKenna should describe Delisle&#8217;s work as &quot;evocative 
              of stylised harlequin figures that threaten to morph into spinning 
              tops&quot;. 1</p>
            <p>A particularly appropriate description, given the pivotal moment 
              Delisle&#8217;s future directions took after seeing Oskar Schlemmer&#8217;s 
              reproduction of the 1922 Triadic Ballet in 1979 at the University 
              of California at Los Angeles, (UCLA Royce Hall). Schlemmer, one 
              of the many young artists that Walter Gropius employed in the early 
              days of the Bauhaus, taught drawing and became director of the Bauhaus 
              stage in Dessau in 1925. The Triadic Ballet was a major choreographic 
              work that Schlemmer developed, describing it as a &quot;triadic 
              (from triad &#8211; three) because of the three dancers and the 
              three parts of its symphonic architectonic composition: the fusion 
              of the dance, the costumes and the music. The special characteristics 
              of the ballet are the costumes which are of a coloured, three- dimensional 
              design, the human figure which is an environment of basic mathematical 
              shapes, and the corresponding movements of that figure in space.&quot; 
              2 Schlemmer&#8217;s fellow colleague at the Bauhaus, Wassily Kandinsky, 
              also worked on commissions for the theatre. In Kandinsky&#8217;s 
              set designs for Mussorgsky&#8217;s music, Pictures at an Exhibition, 
              the inspiration for the figurines in his drawings came from a similarly 
              mathematical abstraction of the figure, so obvious these days in 
              Delisle&#8217;s work.</p>
            <p>The simple boldness of the Kandinsky&#8217;s drawings have a similar 
              dynamic energy to the drawings pinned up in Delisle&#8217;s studio. 
              Her designs, too, are initially mapped out mathematically, cut and 
              dissected geometric shapes that are reassembled into strong graphic 
              profiles. These initial drawings she uses as guides to work out 
              the actual size and shape of the pieces she is to throw, to calculate 
              how the piece will finally go together. Later, as a relief to the 
              strictness required of her making techniques, and as a prelude to 
              the exacting task of decorating, she will return to the drawings, 
              re-rendering them in energetic expressions of rapid marks that make 
              them start to shimmer and move.</p>
            <p><img src="images/delisle3.jpg" alt="Roseline Delisle" width="150" height="230" align="left">As 
              illustrated by the small sketches of Kandinksky&#8217;s figures, 
              the sense of monumentality has little to do with scale. As examples, 
              witness the jewellery of Wendy Ramshaw, with her fine turned finger 
              rings in metal and perspex, striped, stacked, spiked and coned on 
              their personal stands; or the polyester pleated, hooped Tokyo Vogu 
              frock of Issey Miyake, or a Brancusi sculpture or Skytower, the 
              central focus to Sydney&#8217;s cityscape. Monumentality has more 
              to do with understanding the relationships between form and space.</p>
            <p>Conscious of these as influences on her work, Delisle has achieved 
              the extremities of form she has demanded of some of her later works 
              with their increase in scale, by cunning methods of construction, 
              matched only with her skills to carry them out. For example, the 
              narrow waists with flaring skirts; the bulbous &#8216;hips&#8217; 
              and &#8216;shoulders&#8217; and the tiny bases of her pots are all 
              thrown in sections. All are scrupulously manufactured to superfine 
              tolerances, often decorated inside and underneath as well as on 
              their outer surfaces. Delisle now assembles her forms both at leather-hard 
              and at post firing stage, as opposed to letting the porcelain parts 
              fuse together at high temperature. Her damp cupboard is a morgue 
              to the spare body parts she has left over from previous work sessions, 
              these she &#8216;brings out to play&#8217; with the new parts, using 
              them as an extension of her drawing process.</p>
            <p>So precise are her skills at assembling these new totemic works, 
              that it is difficult to see where each join occurs. She makes no 
              secret of the fact that they are in sections, each piece is often 
              named after the number of parts from which they are made. Octet 
              2, for example, or Septet 1. Each individual part of the piece is 
              then threaded on metal rods that feed right through the centre of 
              each section, finally being secured at the base into their own personalised 
              wooden pedestals that are weighted with sand. This acts as her earthquake 
              security system.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Since the arrival of Lili to the family, Delisle has come to recognise 
              that her explorations of scale have become even more connected to 
              the figure, but within a family group. She has taken to choreographing 
              her work together in a conscious array of form, size, shape and 
              colour. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/delisle4.jpg" alt="Roseline Delisle" width="203" height="237"></p>
            <p>She is starting to explore more fully the inter-relationship of 
              these forms to each other within space; to the dynamic gaps that 
              now occur between each form as the stridency of their decoration 
              and the crispness of their shapes creates an even greater sense 
              of discourse. She cites Frank Gehry&#8217;s Dancing House or (&#8216;Fred 
              and Ginger&#8217;) in Prague as a good example of how humanistic 
              architectural structures can actually &#8216;talk to each other&#8217;; 
              how in this building, Gehry has successfully combined the old with 
              the radically new in an attempt to launch old social structures 
              into a brave new millennium.</p>
            <p>On her studio walls, there are two drawings of significance. One 
              is by Lili, a faithful rendering of one of her mother&#8217;s works, 
              but Lili&#8217;s has a softer, more fluid profile; the other is 
              by Delisle herself, of a top heavy, asymmetrical, full-bodied ellipse, 
              topping an elegant tapering base. Delisle&#8217;s possible future 
              directions then, could best be described through Lili&#8217;s recent 
              observations of passing a pregnant woman in the street. As the young 
              woman&#8217;s well rounded belly in her body-hugging dress came 
              into profile, Lili announced that here was another of her mother&#8217;s 
              pots. A startling revelation into the asymmetry of the human figure 
              that Delisle says she is not quite ready to explore. In the meantime, 
              Delisle&#8217;s repertoire is full with her current concerns and 
              her immediate future looks busy. </p>
