            <p>&nbsp; 
            <p><b>Lai Krarm: New Works by Vipoo Srivilasa. Article by Stephen 
              Benwell. </b>
            <p>The collection of ceramic works that Vipoo Srivilasa has brought 
              together for this exhibition surprises with a barrage of visual 
              information. The artist describes, in a series of bowls and vases, 
              a tale of intimate occurrences, each one glimpsed briefly and then 
              left behind as a new thought is brought into focus. It is a spontaneous 
              narrative in which the images have been stored up for the last six 
              or seven years until they have suddenly flooded out. In these pots 
              are memories of an earlier life in Bangkok, his present life in 
              Australia and here and there, little invocations of a future life.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/vipoo/VS09.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS09.jpg" width="224" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS02.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS02.jpg" width="205" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS05.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS05.jpg" width="204" height="175" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>We sense in these works Vipoo&#8217;s excitement in exploring the 
              narrative possibilities of ceramics, a mode that has many precursors 
              but one that is sometimes avoided by practitioners. Descriptive 
              passages of daily life are apparent throughout the long history 
              of painting on ceramics and it is in this context that we should 
              place Vipoo&#8217;s work. He is a good storyteller &#8211; fluent, 
              opinionated, varied and flamboyant. He has a free-flowing and non-didactic 
              style that is just as insightful as any more theoretical analysis 
              of contemporary culture. These pots, when looked at together, form 
              a catalogue of minutiae, the sort of information that will be invaluable 
              to an archaeologist working to retrieve the past in some future 
              excavation.</p>

            <p align="center"><a href="images/vipoo/VS06.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS06.jpg" width="118" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS08.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS08.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS11.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS11.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS13.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS13.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS14.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS14.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>How are we to interpret so many competing images? One way is to 
              take Vipoo&#8217;s lead and respect the divisions that separate 
              each painted segment. We are not meant to resolve his story into 
              a neat, harmonious whole. Instead we are made to feel, uncomfortably 
              at times, the difficulty of making sense of his story. As well, 
              the barricaded pictures are each protected from the influences that 
              threaten to displace each other. Buddhist iconography jostles with 
              emblems of Australian culture. Fashion models rub shoulders with 
              skeletons and vital organs. Consumer goods are compared to the timeless 
              motifs of Thai art. Each motif is offered uncritically and without 
              a hierarchical structure. Confusion reigns but even in this idea 
              we feel that Vipoo gives us a faithful recording of an imperfect, 
              disturbing and endlessly variable world.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/vipoo/VS19.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS19.jpg" width="241" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS16.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS16.jpg" width="240" height="175" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Historical ironies abound in this work too. In the seventeenth 
              century, the artistry of East Asia was a revelation to the wealthy 
              connoisseurs of Europe. When the crates of imported porcelain were 
              unpacked in the warehouses of Amsterdam and London, a collecting 
              mania developed for the blue and white vases with their vistas of 
              dreamy mountains where scholars rested amidst an exquisite rendering 
              of nature. Vipoo&#8217;s vases recall this famous and influential 
              trade in ceramics. Sent from Australia whose role in East Asia continues 
              to be debated, his vases will be unpacked in Bangkok and exhibited 
              there. While the seventeenth century trade routes no longer prevail, 
              the art of blue and white porcelain continues to serve as exchange 
              between cultures, bringing to a curious audience in Bangkok some 
              vignettes of Australian life.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/vipoo/VS28.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS28.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS24.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS24.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS25.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS25.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a><a href="images/vipoo/VS26.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS26.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0"></a></p>
            <p><a href="images/vipoo/VS27.jpg"><img src="images/vipoo/thumbs/VS27.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="0" align="left"></a>In 
              Vipoo&#8217;s work, blue and white porcelain emerges in a hybrid 
              form. By grafting his contemporary ceramic practice onto that grand 
              tradition, and juxtaposing emblems of Thai and Australian culture, 
              he reorientates its settled expectations. Aside from the contemporary 
              and historical contexts of these pots, there is the simple pleasure 
              that can be taken by looking into the rich indigo blue as it sinks 
              into the brittle white porcelain. Since its invention by Chinese 
              potters during the Yuan dynasty, blue and white porcelain has become 
              probably the best-loved and most ubiquitous genre of ceramics. In 
              Vipoo&#8217;s pots, the seemingly effortless magic of the materials 
              provides the artist with the means to release an outpouring of imagery. 
              He delves into a narrative style whose inventive scope strains at 
              the containing forms of vase, bottle and bowl.</p>
