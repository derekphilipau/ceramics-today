              German studio potter resident in Japan
            <P> <img src="images/knapper1.jpg" alt="Gerd Kn&auml;pper" width="200" height="257" hspace="5" align="left"><b><a href="http://www.gerdKn&auml;pperer.com/">Gerd 
              Kn&auml;pper's</a></b> story is truly an amazing one. Kn&auml;pper 
              studied in Germany with Host Kerstan and in Japan with Seisei Suzuki. 
              In 1968, he moved to the Japanese pottery town of Mashiko, building 
              the first foreign owned workshop there. In 1975 he moved to Daigo, 
              north of Mashiko. 
            <P>In 1971, after having lived and worked in Japan for only two 30 
              months, he was awarded the Grand Prize for Traditional Japanese 
              Ceramics at the First National Competition in Tokyo, stunning the 
              Japanese pottery community. In 1986 he won the Prime Minister's 
              Award at the Japan Contemporary Crafts Association exhibition. In 
              1991 he was awarded the Order of Merit by the German government 
              in recognition of his achievements in ceramics and in bringing together 
              East and West.

            <P><img src="images/knapper_pic.jpg" alt="Kn&auml;pper at work" width="160" height="130" align="left">In 
              his pottery, Kn&auml;pper blends German and Japanese aesthetics. 
              His wheel-thrown pottery is carved, fluted, scratched and glazed, 
              then wood-fired in a traditional Japanese kiln. He also makes stylized 
              figurative sculpture and since 2000 he has also been involved in 
              <a href="http://www.gerdKn&auml;pperer.com/monuments.html"> <b>architectural
              commissions.</b></a> 
            <P>Kn&auml;pper says his &quot;work is inspired by primitive and modern art 
              of various cultures. I don&#8217;t consider myself a Japanese artist 
              nor a German artist. Based on my unique position, my work inherits 
              an independent structure with elements of the East and of the West&quot;. 
              He is currently looking forward to the completion in March 2006 
              of a new 'Gatehouse' and the opening of his Tarosaka Gallery.
