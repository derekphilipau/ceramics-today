              ceramist and teacher <a href="http://www.stanwelsh.com/"><b>Stan 
              Welsh</b></a> received his BFA at the Kansas City Art Institute 
              in 1974 and his MFA at the New York State College of Ceramics at 
              Alfred University in 1978. He has taught at San Jose State University, 
              California since 1981. He has received several grants and awards, 
              including an *NEA grant in 1986, a California Arts Council Grant 
              in 1990. 
            <p>In the <a href="http://www.stanwelsh.com/gallery2/gallery2wk.html"><b>1980s</b></a> 
              Welsh made large, stylized narrative terracotta head forms with 
              heavy incising and carving filled with brightly colored glazes. 
              His work then became more monochromatic, incorporated other materials 
              and referenced social and political issues. Starting in <a href="http://www.stanwelsh.com/gallery7/gallery7.html"><b>2000</b></a> 
              Stan began working on a series of heroic terracotta heads (4 or 
              5 times life scale) that are the most representational work he has 
              done to date. These highly expressive heads with intense facial 
              expressions representing a wide range of human emotions were featured 
              in an exhibition at the Daum Museum in Missouri in 2004. The show 
              was titled &quot;Bay Area Ceramic Sculptors&quot; and included the 
              work of Arthur Gonzalez, Annabeth Rosen, Nancy Selvin and Stan Welsh.

            <p>In this recent work Welsh continues to investigate social and political 
              issues. Welsh lives and works at his studio in Santa Cruz, California. 
              He will be exhibiting his current work in a solo exhibition at the 
              Santa Cruz Museum of Contemporary Art from January to April 2005.
            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p><img src="images/welsh/portrait.jpg" width="111" height="154" align="left">My 
              work has evolved through many different phases or variations on 
              theme and style. In the mid 80s to 1990 the theme of my work was 
              large abstract head forms made out of terra cotta clay. The surfaces 
              were heavily incised and carved with images and subconscious narratives. 
              The incised lines and surface textures were filled with brightly 
              colored glazes leaving the background or exposed areas as raw terra 
              cotta or brown clay. The emphasis on these sculptures was as much 
              on the surface drawings as on the forms themselves. 
            <p align="center"><a href="images/welsh/Whisper.jpg"><img src="images/welsh/thumbs/Whisper.jpg" alt="Stan Welsh, Whisper" width="117" height="175" hspace="3" border="0"></a><a href="images/welsh/Mickey%27s%20Shadow.jpg"><img src="images/welsh/thumbs/Mickeys_Shadow.jpg" alt="Stan Welsh, Mickey's Shadow" width="117" height="175" hspace="3" border="0"></a>
            <p>From 1990-95 the clay forms became more monochromatic and I included 
              a wide range of mixed media with the clay such as branches, sheet 
              lead, photographs, books, and a wide range of found objects. This 
              work remained autobiographical but also made reference to social 
              and political issues which the earlier work did not.</p>
            <p><a href="images/welsh/studio.jpg"><img src="images/welsh/thumbs/studio.jpg" alt="Stan Welsh at work" width="117" height="175" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              recent work started in 1995 represents a two-year transition or 
              search for new meaning and direction in my work. The work has returned 
              to an autobiographical quest making many references to myself and 
              my life using a wide range of images to explore personal, psychological, 
              and emotional content. The recent work is made with terra cotta 
              clay and then glazed with very thick color saturated satin matt 
              glazes. The surfaces are very smooth and the images that I use are 
              much more specific than in past work. The emphasis of this new work 
              is on form and in bringing together complex relationships of space 
              and form with these saturated satin matt surfaces.</p>
