              American clay sculptor 
            <P> <img src="images/lucero2.jpg" alt="Lady with Roots, New World Series" width="247" height="312" align="left">During 
              his early period <a href="http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/marapr/feat6.html"><b>Michael
              Lucero</b></a> made composite sculptures using hundreds of thin, 
              hand-made tiles which were attached to wire frames. Often these 
              would be human figures, but sometimes animal forms. Already in these 
              early works, one can see combinations of human/animal, culture/nature, 
              architecture/organism that have remained an element in Lucero's 
              subsequent work. 
            <P> In his next 'Dreamer' series, Lucero made <i>Pink Nude Dreamer</i>, 
              which consists of the head form that Lucero repeatedly uses for 
              this series. It is decorated with a range of painted scenes reflecting 
              Lucero's early undergraduate training in painting at Humboldt State 
              University in California. 
            <P><img src="images/lucero2b.jpg" alt="Lady with Roots (reverse)" width="250" height="313" align="left">Employing 
              painted underglazes and sgraffito on a shape that doesn't directly 
              relate to the imagery, we see typical painterly elements of Lucero's 
              work that he has become so well known for. One cannot but help getting 
              a distinct feeling of surrealism here. The fantastic images Lucero 
              paints on his forms seem to spring from the sub-conscious and speak 
              to sub-conscious strands of the viewers mind. 
            <P> Lucero's interest in the Native American Pueblo dates back to 
              his childhood travels from California to relatives in New Mexico. 
              Here he would come into contact with American Natives and their 
              culture. Native American rugs, jewelry, sculpture and ceramics would 
              come to influence Lucero in his later life. The Californian and 
              New Mexican environment also supplied the artist with a rich abundance 
              of animal life, especially reptiles and amphibians that he loved 
              as a child and employed in his imagery later in life. 
            <P> <img src="images/lucero3.jpg" alt="Anthropomorphic Urn with Dragonfly, 2002" width="234" height="346" align="left">This 
              is especially the case in his 'Earth Images' installation. Here 
              we are presented with the <i>Hercules Beetle</i> of 1986 (pictured 
              left). The fantastic, upright beetle is distorted and again surreal, 
              painted with images of trees on the one hand and míro-like color 
              fields on the other. Here, nature and culture collide. A closer 
              inspection of the head reveals a pale, haunting ghost-like figure 
              and scenery, perhaps suggesting stories of Native American medicine 
              men or their people's beliefs. The overall effect is one of a bio-morphic 
              enigma of disparate elements that nonetheless has a naturalness 
              about it. 
            <P> Lucero pays homage to the pueblo in his 'Pre-Columbus' series, 
              which consists of distorted seated figures, glazed in bright colors 
              and painted with environmental scenes juxtaposed with screaming 
              heads and pueblo pottery. Pre-columbian art contrasts with classical 
              and modern painting traditions. The bar code and the tea-pot create 
              a reference to the modern world and in a sense pre-empt Lucero's 
              next series, the 'New World' series (e.g. <i>Lady with Roots</i>, 
              pictured top left), which deals with the radical changes Columbus' 
              discovery of the New World inflicted on the continent. 
            <P> <img src="images/lucero.jpg" alt="Michael Lucero" width="88" height="108" align="left">In 
              the 'Reclamation'<B> </B> series, the artist incorporated his love 
              of collecting antiques and novelties into his art work. Lucero took 
              'found' objects and added to them, creating totally new and compelling 
              works. This series includes the work <i>Angola Carolina</i> which 
              consists of a head in the form of a keg with a large painted beetle 
              as the nose. The piece is reminiscent of the work of American ceramic 
              artist George Ohr (1857-1918) whose work Lucero admires and collects 
              fervently.
