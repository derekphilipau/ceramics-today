              ceramic sculptor Jeff Schmuki asks us to consider what may lie beyond 
              the horizon with regards to landscape. His hand-built, laminated 
              and compressed sculptural objects, site responsive installations 
              and clay drawings represent the Mississippi landscape. 
            <p>Jeff earned an MFA in Ceramics at NYSCC at Alfred University in 
              1998 and a BFA in Ceramics from Northern Arizona University in 1993. 
              He has been a Kohler artist-in-residence in the John Michael Kohler 
              Arts Center, Sheyboygan, WI . He is currently developing a permanent 
              work for the new federal courthouse in Jackson, MS. and has exhibited 
              in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and South Korea.</p>

              Carey College on the Coast in Gulfport, MS. In the spring of 2006 
              he will travel to Izmir, Turkey for advanced study and as visiting 
              artist and professor of ceramics at Dokuz Eylul University.</p>

            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b></p>
            <p> My work is a collection of floor and wall based objects, installations, 
              and drawings. I am interested in working with common, banal, materials 
              and the process necessary to bring them into a poetic space. I am 
              interested in landscape and what what landscape in the 21st century 
              can mean. My work references, records, and documents my physical 
              experience of the Mississippi landscape. By translating the bodily 
              experience into a conceptual understanding, place becomes space 
              and the physical becomes conceptual.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/schmuki/Ribbon.jpg"><img src="images/schmuki/thumbs/Ribbon.jpg" width="151" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/schmuki/detail_ribbon.jpg"><img src="images/schmuki/thumbs/detail_ribbon.jpg" width="151" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>My current work is about my experience of the Mississippi landscape. 
              Now when you hear landscape, a painting more than likely first comes 
              to mind. I want to go beyond that expectation. I want to use actual 
              landscape to make the work. I am interested in what landscape means 
              today in the 21st century? One work traces my walk in the piney 
              woods.<br>
              It is laid out on the floor and leads from room to room much like 
              the original path I took. Being interested in science, the work 
              also references the geology of the area. Each unit is composed of 
              laminated, and compressed clay sheets. Each unit is inspired by 
              how the land was formed as well as the rise and fall of the path. 
              This modular method might also reference our digital age and how 
              information is broken down into small bits. The canvas on which 
              I work is stained by the local red clay and generates a drawing 
              or record of each landscape. I think our times and experiences are 
              much different than those that occurred just 25 even 50 years ago. 
              How might our responses to landscape also reflect our present time?</p>
