              Sures</a></b> (b. 1934). Canadian ceramist making wheel-thrown, 
              vessel-based work as well as hand-built sculpture. Sures graduated 
              with a BFA in painting and printmaking at the University of Manitoba 
              in 1957 and earned an MA in ceramics at Michigan State University 
              in 1959. From 1960-61 he worked in London, Britain, learning mold 
              making, slip casting and production wheel-throwing. He established 
              a studio in Winnipeg in 1962. Three years later he established the 
              ceramics department at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus 
              (now the University of Regina), where he served as Chairman of the 
              Department of Visual Arts from 1969-71 and became Professor Emeritus 
              in 1998.

            <p>In 1965 and 1972 Sures was the recipient of two Canada Council 
              grants to study in Japan and France respectively. In 1973-74 he 
              was involved in a United Nations Handcraft Development Program in 
              Granada, West Indies. In 1989 he was awarded the Grand Prize in 
              Mino, Japan. He received the Order of Canada in 1991 and was recognized 
              by the Province of Saskatchewan for 'contributions to Canada and 
              the Province' in 1992. Sures worked on various commissions, including 
              murals for the Provincial Office Building in Saskatoon and the Museum 
              of Civilization in Ottawa.
            <p>&quot;My love of clay as an expressive material, with its innate 
              ability to create any and all other materials, its ability to reinvent 
              itself every time it is touched, has endowed my life with a richness 
              and completeness that few people seem to achieve in their lifetimes. 
              My hope is that this richness and completeness is reflected in the 
              work and this spirit is transferred to the viewer.&quot; (See <a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Fire_Earth/Artists/Sures/SuresStmtEn.html"><b>Artist's
