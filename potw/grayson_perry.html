                  towers, the media seemed to be full of reports of prejudice 
                  and anger from all sides. In this pot the toys are just as much 
                  the bigots and aggressors as the war planes flying overhead,

            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none">In the early 1980s 
              Grayson Perry was a member of the Neo-Naturist group, participating 
              in performance and film works. He has continued to make work in 
              a variety of media which now include embroidery and photography. 
              Yet Perry is best known for his ceramic works, creating classically 
              shaped vases decorated with figures, objects and text, which stand 
              within a tradition stretching back for centuries.&nbsp; The revealing 
              and often dark subject matter depicted on these pots is at first 
              disguised by their colourful, decorative nature.&nbsp; His chosen 
              topics include autobiographical images of himself, his transvestite 
              alter ego Claire, and his family, as well as references to political 
              events and an investigation of observed cultural stereotypes.&nbsp; 
              Over the last five years Perry has also used embroidery and photography 
              to explore these themes, most notably in the photograph Mother of 
              all Battles (1996) which shows Claire holding a gun, and wearing 
              Perry&#8217;s first embroidered folk costume. This was followed by Claire&#8217;s 
              Coming Out (2000), which Perry staged as a performance to present 
              a richly embroidered childlike dress for Claire, in this instance 
              merging his private female persona with his artwork. </p>

              looks back to his upbringing in the Essex countryside to find his 
              subject matter as presented on the vase, I was an Angry Working 
              Class Man (2001) which presents the recognizable iconography of 
              motorbikes, pub signs and other images of manhood, topped off with 
              the golden figure of an emasculated Pit Bull Terrier, mascot of 
              the stereotypical Essex Man.&nbsp; He also seeks to engage directly 
              with contemporary issues such as in the vase We've Found the Body 
              of your Child (2000), which deals not only with paedophilia, but 
              with child abuse within the home, or Dolls at Dungeness, September 
              11th 2001, which depicts seemingly innocent infant figures playing 
              in the bleak landscape, whilst war planes hover overhead. Operating 
              within the tradition of William Hogarth or James Gillray, he also 
              uses his ceramics to satirise other art forms, as in Gimmick, 1996, 
              which lists artists&#8217; trademark methods, such as Jackson Pollock-drips 
              or Alexander Calder-mobiles.&nbsp; Perry employs and simultaneously 
              subverts the craft form of ceramics, revelling in its second class 
              status within world of fine arts, to explore challenging, yet witty 
              and thought provoking themes.&nbsp; Perry comments, &#8216;A lot of my 
              work has always had a guerrilla tactic, a stealth tactic. I want 
              to make something that lives with the eye as a beautiful piece of 
              art, but on closer inspection, a polemic or an ideology will come 
              out of it&#8217;. </p>
