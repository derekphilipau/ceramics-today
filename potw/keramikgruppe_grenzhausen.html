            <p> The dynamics of a small group working together in a ceramic studio 
              can be rewarding and productive.
            <p> <a href="images/keramikgruppe/group.jpg"><img src="images/keramikgruppe/thumbs/group.jpg" width="91" height="91" border="0" align="left"></a>This 
              can be seen at its best in the Keramikgruppe Grenzhausen. For the 
              thirteen years that they have been together so much good work has 
              been made, both for the development of the artists and for the benefit 
              of all who see and acquire their work. They seem such a happy group, 
              and it all happens without pressure or problem, as they go about 
              their lives, raising families, enjoying all that a positive situation 
              through their work can provide. I have visited the studio on a number 
              of occasions and have met various members of the group at different 
              locations in other countries. There is always good news and friendliness; 
              and this must be why their work continues to be so good. I wish 
              them well for future decades while congratulating them on the past 
              one.

              A. was awarded a journeyman&#8217;s certificate after an apprenticeship 
              with G. &amp; A. Schiessler in Kr&ouml;sselbach-Eberbach from 1980-83. 
              She then studied at the State College of Ceramic Design and Technology, 
              H&ouml;hr-Grenzhausen, graduating with a State Diploma in 1986. 
              She was awarded a Master&#8217;s Diploma in 1987. She established 
              her own studio in 1986, then in 1992 co-founded the ceramics co-operative

              Debus</a></b> was apprenticed with the Hagemann Pottery in Oldenburg 
              from 1987-89 and studied at the State College of Ceramic Design 
              and Technology in H&ouml;hr-Grenzhausen from 1989-92. She established 
              her own studio in 1993 and has been a member of the co-operative 
              Keramikgruppe Grenzhausen since 1994. She has taught at the University 
              of Giessen since 1997. Her awards include a First Prize for an architectural 
              work in 1999 and a Merit Prize at &#8216;Salt-glazed Ceramics&#8217; 
              in Koblenz in 2002. D. makes two-tone slab-built stoneware vessels 
              which are low salt-fired in a *reduction atmosphere.</p>
            <p>&quot;My particular kind of stoneware differs from that of my peers 
              as it concentrates firstly on painting, and secondly on the vessel 
              and it&acute;s form, and therefore I complement the simplicity of 
              my painting with a basic slab building technique. I have never been 
              attracted to complicated things and that is maybe why I like to 
              leave things to chance. The low-salt-firing allows me to obtain 
              subtle surfaces and colors . The pieces are fired once in a gas 
              kiln to 1140&deg;C in a reduced atmosphere.&quot;</p>

            <p><b><a href="http://www.keramikgruppe.de/html/fri/fri.html">Fritz 
              Rossmann</a></b> was apprenticed with Wim M&uuml;hlendyck from 1975&#8211;78. 
              He then studied at the State College of Ceramic Design and Technology 
              in H&ouml;hr-Grenzhausen from 1980&#8211;83. In 1992, he became 
              a member of the collaborative workshop Keramikgruppe Grenzhausen. 
              He works with a grey stoneware and porcelain with a red slip, creating 
              characteristic horizontal banding with contrasting glazed and unglazed 
              areas. His forms are decidedly contemporary, bearing little resemblance 
              to any ceramic traditions. Rossmann taught at the University of 
              Giessen from 1991&#8211;97.</p>
            <p>&quot;Rossmann's work relies on the historical language of the 
              vessel form. He has had a long term interest in the traces of history 
              seen in vessels and hag specific admiration f&uuml;r the Egyptian 
              and Greek amphorae. The appreciation f&uuml;r these forms goes back 
              to his first visit to the Museum of Modem Art in New York City. 
              &quot;That form hag followed me all my life...Egyptian pots, their 
              throwing lines... the beauty of forms developed thousands of years 
              ago.&quot;</p>
