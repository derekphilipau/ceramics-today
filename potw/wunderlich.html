            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b>
            <p><img src="images/wunderlich/at_work.jpg" alt="Janis Mars Wunderlich at work" width="244" height="204" align="left">My 
              imagery captures the exhaustion and exhilaration of life as both 
              a creative artist and busy parent. My children inspire me with both 
              their imaginative minds and animal-like energy. As I nurture and 
              care for them, they continually feed my thoughts with their &#8220;fairytale-like&#8221; 
              quirkiness.
            <p>But parenting is physically and emotionally demanding! The cleaning, 
              cooking, chores, and laundry never end. The tantrums, messy diapers, 
              and adolescent &#8220;sassiness&#8221; are emotionally draining. 
              The babies are always clinging to me, hanging onto my arms and legs. 
              Sometimes I look like a playground! But I love it!</p>
            <p>My recent work explores the idea of &#8220;accessorizing&#8221; 
              with children. Sometimes I feel as though my wardrobe consists of 
              kids from head to toe. Instead of &#8220;artsy&#8221; or fancy accessories 
              and jewelry, I have children hanging from my ears, neck, and arms! 
              In a sense, the mother figure seems hidden or lost behind all the 
              clingy creatures. But in reality, she is strengthened, clothed, 
              and made beautiful by them. They give her layers, textures, identity.</p>
            <p>Children&#8217;s literature is a big influence in my work, from 
              Peter Rabbit and Curious George to the Wild Things and Grimm Fairy 
              Tales.. (My kids LOVE stories!). Mother Goose has especially influenced 
              me in recent works. I love the bizarre poetry about men who go to 
              sea in a bowl, cows jumping over the moon, or dishes running away 
              with spoons! These stories, much like my sculptures, are filled 
              with animalistic creatures who provoke the mind to look beyond reality 
              into the realm of the imagination.</p>
            <p>I feel a natural connection to the animal kingdom, (mostly because 
              my children often behave like naughty little animals!) but also 
              because of the inherent nurturing and protective instincts that 
              I possess as a mother. My imagery often has animalistic qualities, 
              making my sculptures reference humanity in all its diversities.</p>
            <p>I am amazed at how my parental experiences&#8212;the good and frustrating&#8212;fuel 
              my imagination. I view my sculptural works much like journal entries 
              that document my personal journeys. I often create work laden with 
              complex dualities, showing both the suffering and joys of life.</p>
            <p>My sculptures are handbuilt using thin, slab-like coils of clay. 
              The glaze surfaces are built up by multifiring layers of underglaze, 
              slips, and overglaze.</p>
            <p>Motherhood fills my mind and life with such incredible images and 
              experiences. The challenge for me is to keep my sanity and sense 
              of humor as I balance my time between all the fun and craziness 
              of parenthood and art-making. It&#8217;s been an amazing journey 
              so far!</p>
