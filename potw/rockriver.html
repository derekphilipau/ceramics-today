              Resnik Rockriver</a></b> is an American ceramist and glass artist 
              based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Rockriver received a BFA (Hons) 
              in Ceramics and Painting from the University of North Carolina, 
              Chapel Hill in 1992 and an MFA in Ceramics and Combined Media from 
              Hunter College, City University of New York (CUNY) in 1996. She 
              has been a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Honor's Society since 1992. 
              She taught at Moorhead State University in Minnesota from 1996-98.
            <p>Rockriver generates chemical reactions in blown glass and ceramics, 
              creating 'geochemical formations' through high temperature crystal 
              growth. She established the <a href="http://192.101.22.176:64761/rtl.asp"><b>Resnik 
              Thermal Lab</b></a>, a glass blowing school and ceramics research 
              facility that emphasizes the intersection of art and science, in 
              Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1999.

            <p><b>Artist's Statement</b><br>
              <br>
              <a href="images/rockriver/rockriver5.jpg"><img src="images/rockriver/thumbs/rockriver5.jpg" width="79" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>My 
              work mirrors a geothermal world by activating and harnessing thermal 
              formations of ceramic materials. I have always been more interested 
              in the glaze and how it forms than in the clay object itself. My 
              clay work is directed toward enhancing glaze formation. Initially, 
              I had to create forms that ceased controlling these glazes in order 
              to understand their free nature and I now try to capture and direct 
              this molten force. <br>
              <br>
              The crystalline wall hangings emulate water, geology, and weather 
              systems. The subject of the work is the crystal, how it grows, and 
              how the running glaze is important to its formation. The crystalline 
              slab pieces have an undulating surface that enhances and directs 
              crystal growth. The works explore the ideal slope for crystal formation 
              along with capturing a moving crystal as it forms. 
            <p>The calcite formations are evocative of caves, geysers, and underwater 
              formations.This is mainly due to the fact that what actually occurs 
              during and after the firing is similar to the processes that create 
              natural phenomena. While the pieces are hot, glaze bubbles and seeps 
              down the framework of the sculptures, similar to the way calcium 
              forms stalactites in a cavern. After the firing, humidity causes 
              this glaze to continue to grow. As the surface oxidizes, it develops 
              a mossy covering of spiny crystals. Upon weathering, the pieces 
              turn yellow and lavender, eroding and recrystallizing with every 
              season. These works do not imitate life, rather they are their own 
              geological specimen.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rockriver/rockriver4.jpg"><img src="images/rockriver/thumbs/rockriver4.jpg" width="178" height="120" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/rockriver/rockriver6.jpg"><img src="images/rockriver/thumbs/rockriver6.jpg" width="181" height="120" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>My glasswork highlights the ceramic glaze by encapsulating cores 
              of glaze in a glass column. I infuse blown glass forms with ceramic 
              glazes that react and bubble at this high temperature. These glazes 
              heat and crystallize as they cool, much like in my ceramic pieces 
              but in the supportive envelope of clear glass. Differing coefficients 
              of expansion and contraction form iridescent fissures that are magnified 
              by the glass. Blown glass compliments my ceramic works because it 
              allows me to magnify my glazes and separate them from the clay format. 
            </p>
            <p>In all of my works, I am designing a format that will accentuate 
              a given glaze. The tendency of the glaze to drip, run, pool, grow, 
              and crystallize is the primary focus of the work. The geological 
              tone is a direct result of the nature of these materials. As part 
              of my exploration, I share my findings with members of the scientific 
              community and treat many of my projects as research specimens. Underlying 
              all of my work is the thread of geochemistry and thermal formations.
