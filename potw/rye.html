              Rye has been studying, practicing, teaching and writing about ceramic 
              art for 40 years. His contributions to the field are well documented: 
              the list of publications, conference presentations and exhibitions 
              spans seven pages in his biography. He is a well-known leader in 
              the woodfire movement in Australia and overseas, and his interest 
              in all things involving clay and fire has made him a valued teacher 
              across the broad spectrum of ceramics. He will retire from Melbourne's 
              Monash University at the end of 2003 to focus on his studio work 
              at Boolarra South in, Victoria. It seems an appropriate stage for 
              some reconnaissance, exploring the nuances of his new anagama kiln, 
              and seeking new ideas and directions. His <a href="http://www.ceramicart.com.au/gallery/owen_rye.html"><b>2003
              exhibition at the Ceramic Art Gallery</b></a> in Sydney confirms 
              he is doing just that.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Western countries like Australia, the cultural 
              baggage that comes with anagama firing and kilns can prove overwhelming 
              and aesthetically limiting, leading to work that seems out of kilter 
              with both its Japanese birthplace and adopted homeland. Rye's work, 
              in contrast, is identifiably Australian and uniquely his own. It 
              has evolved in Australia, through his trial-and-error approach to 
              learning the process. He never trained in Japan and cites no Japanese 
              potter or style responsible for his development. He values the friendship 
              of New Zealand/Australian woodfirer <a href="http://www.the-anagama.com/En/nealie/"><b>Chester 
              Nealie</b></a>, and acknowledges the influence of <a href="http://www.ceramicart.com.au/gallery/peascod/peascod.html"><b>Alan
              Peascod's concepts of multi-layered surfaces</b></a>. Rye also shares 
              with Peascod an interest in Middle Eastern ceramics. </p>

              forms are robust and forthright, yet with a softness and subtlety 
              that suits the firing process as well as his aesthetic. Surfaces 
              don't just sit well on his pots; they manipulate the forms through 
              effects of fire, accumulated glaze and ash, and post-firing treatment 
              such as sandblasting. Many reviewers have focused on the imagery 
              of these complex surfaces. Says Rye: &quot;The best forms derive 
              from a mixture of intent and accident. I look for qualities of form 
              which proclaim the fluidity of clay, the softness derived from a 
              somewhat erratic movement, slowed down and frozen&quot;.</p>
