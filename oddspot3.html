                Scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory have devised a 
                method to store nuclear waste using ceramics. The scientists think 
                that combining radioactive waste with crystalline fluorite ceramic 
                oxides could produce a material that, while radioactive, would 
                never contaminate the environment.</p>

                must deal with the whims of a mysterious shopping mall utopia 
                called the Centre. Saramago&#8217;s fictional nightmare may be 
                uncomfortably close to the reality of many ceramists today, but 
                the pleasure of making wins out in the end. &quot;On the morning 
                of the fourth day, as if the mischievious slippery goblins, which 
                were the various materials he was using, had repented of their 
                cruel treatment of this unexpected beginner in the new art, Cipriano 
                Algor began to find softness where before he found only hardness, 
                docilities that filled him with gratitude and secrets that willingly 
                unveiled themselves to him.&quot;<br>

                some amusement) was an English pottery worker, usually a young 
                boy, who was the Saggar Maker's assistant. His sole job was to 
                make saggar bases from a lump of fireclay which he knocked into 
                a metal ring using a wooden mallet or mawl.</p>

                the 15th C, many Hispano-Moresque wares made at Valencia, Spain, 
                were shipped to Italy via the island of Majorca, at the time also 
                known as Majorica or Majolica - hence the name <b><a href="articles/042197.html">Majolica</a></b>
                or Maiolica for white tin-glazed wares. The tin-glaze technique 
                was first used in the Middle East, as early as the 12th C.</p>

                is probably a corruption of the name S&atilde;l&atilde;h-ed-d&icirc;n 
                (Saladin), Sultan of Egypt, who is said to have given forty pieces 
                of celadon wares to the Sultan of Damascus in 1171. It is sometimes 
                erroneously suggested that the name derives from the color of 
                a costume in the 17th C French play, L'Astr&#233;e. The Chinese 
                word for Celadon is 'Doh chin' which means 'green bean glaze', 
                while the Japanese name is 'Seiji'.</p>
