            <p><img src="images/rock_glaze.jpg" alt="Rock Glazes" width="174" height="276" hspace="5" align="left">Pottery, 
              unlike painting, does not depict landscape; it is the landscape. 
              The earth beneath the potters feet is transformed through knowledge, 
              gained empirically or through scientific theory, which allows sticky 
              mud, obdurate rock and the detritus of plants &#8211; even animals 
              - to be rendered into objects which may be both useful and beautiful. 
              In Rock Glazes, Geology and Mineral Processing for Potters: A Personal 
              Approach, Steve Harrison examines how the studio-potter may use 
              these materials to create glazes that echo the land in a manner 
              that is both literal and abstract. </p>
            <p>For thousands of years, whether in the hands of village craftsmen 
              or technocrats, these skills were an integral part of the practice 
              of ceramics. Over time this knowledge was compartmentalized, hived 
              off as the province of specialists. Within the manufactories of 
              Stoke on Trent, or traditional Chinese pottery areas like Longquan 
              or Jingdezhen, the vast scale of production led to a situation whereby 
              those who made the pots were not the same people who made the clay, 
              and the workers who made the glazes did not build or fired the kilns. 
              Such is the nature of industry, an enterprise which, whilst not 
              being without craftsmanship, is quite different to the crafts, as 
              the term came to be understood in the late nineteenth and twentieth 
              centuries.</p>
            <p>With the advent of the modern crafts movement came the notion of 
              the studio-potter, and, thanks to outspoken and persuasive commentators 
              like Bernard Leach, many craftspeople sought to work in a deliberately 
              anti-industrial fashion. An integral part of this new model was 
              the concept of &#8216;truth to materials&#8217;. Whereas industry 
              strove to make pottery that was ever whiter, finer and glossier, 
              many within the crafts movement sought other directions. What industry 
              considered flaws were celebrated within the crafts, and came to 
              define no less than an alternate aesthetic paradigm. </p>
            <p>Leach was the pivot around which this part of ceramic history turned. 
              A Potter&#8217;s Book, published in 1940, was the first generally 
              available text (which is not to say it was the only one) for the 
              studio-potter to deal comprehensively with how stoneware pottery 
              could be made outside of an industrial setting. In this book, Leach 
              gave detailed, practical guidance of how common minerals, like feldspar, 
              limestone and quartz, could provide the backbone for high temperature 
              glazes. In addition, drawing on his experience of North Asian traditions, 
              he included other non-industrial materials, wood ash, or the Japanese 
              kimaichi stone, in his glaze recipes. A Potter&#8217;s Book contains 
              analysis of these hitherto overlooked substances, and explains how 
              they may modify or replace more &#8216;traditional&#8217; glaze 
              ingredients. For the first time the studio potter was able to see 
              how the ash from their fireplace (or, in those more lenient times, 
              the backyard incinerator) contained many of the substances necessary 
              to construct a workable stoneware glaze. This was a radical departure 
              from standard Western ceramic practice, but, in Leach&#8217;s view, 
              a potter might not only gain a degree of independence by working 
              in this way, but it would imbue their work with an organic quality, 
              setting it apart from industrial ware. Philosophy and practice would 
              meet, and be reconciled. The extent to which this approach was adopted, 
              and how it may have benefited or constrained the ceramic arts, is 
              still the subject of debate. </p>
            <p>In Australia, many of the pioneers of studio pottery followed suit. 
              Harold and Robert Hughan, aided by Leach&#8217;s book, turned quickly 
              from the idiom of earthenware and were amongst the very first exponents 
              of high-fired studio-pottery. Ivan Mc Meekin, who had worked with 
              Michael Cardew in England, became obsessed with materials, a process 
              which would culminate in his extraordinary text Notes for Potters 
              in Australia, a treatise on Australian ceramic materials which remains 
              unparalleled in its rigor. Ivan Englund began his exploration of 
              rock glazes, and, from Eileen Keys in Western Australia to Carl 
              McConnell in Queensland, potters turned to the ground to see what 
              vigor was in its bones. </p>
            <p>The use of &#8216;natural&#8217; materials is fundamentally a stoneware 
              technique, but in the early years kilns that could reliably reach 
              stoneware temperatures were few and far between, and many an exciting 
              - and risky - experiment was carried out with dripping sump-oil 
              and jerry-rigged blowers in sheds across the country. With a copy 
              of A Potter&#8217;s Book, or later Daniel Rhodes&#8217; excellent 
              Clay and Glazes for the Potter near at hand, Australian potters 
              covered their pots in simple mixtures of clay, ash, limestone, dolomite, 
              feldspar and quartz, crossed their fingers and waited nervously 
              for the results. </p>
            <p>With the advent of journals and books dedicated to Australian studio 
              pottery, information gleaned from this experimental work became 
              available, although, Australian publishing being what it is, the 
              pace was somewhat leisurely. It was in the pages of Pottery in Australia 
              magazine that a meaningful dialogue began as to the nature of stoneware 
              techniques, the clays, glazes and kilns germane to this exciting 
              field of endeavor. Given the makeup of the editorial staff this 
              was no surprise, and as early as the third issue (May 1963) Ivan 
              Englund, who was then President of the Potters Society of New South 
              Wales, the publishers of the magazine, authored an article &#8216;The 
              Bumbo Latite &#8211; a useful igneous rock for potters&#8217;. It 
              is here that we find a template for all future contributions on 
              the use of Australian rocks in stoneware glazes, and which, somewhat 
              belatedly, serves as an introduction to a discussion of Harrison&#8217;s 
              book. </p>
            <p>Not unnaturally, most treatises on the subject of rock glazes have 
              several things in common, and Harrison&#8217;s book is no exception. 
              There is information on the chemical and physical nature of glazes, 
              on the raw materials and how one might go about collecting them, 
              and the all-important question of how the rocks are to be rendered 
              into a state useful to the potter. This latter problem is addressed 
              in two ways. One is to find a working quarry, make friends with 
              the quarrymen, and collect the fine dust from around the crushers. 
              This is the easy way, favored by Ivan Englund in his 1983 book on 
              the subject, Rock Glazes. The second option is to assemble a range 
              of implements whereby several kilos of rocks may be turned into 
              a powder fine enough to be suspended in a glaze solution. This is 
              the hard way, though it brings its own challenges and rewards, if 
              you are prepared to spend the necessary time, effort and money in 
              doing so, and if you live far enough from neighbors to get away 
              with the racket. Steve Harrison covers both options, but, perhaps 
              understandably given the complexity of the task (and also, I suspect, 
              due to the fact that he just has a lot of fun doing it) it is the 
              latter approach which is stressed.</p>
            <p>Jaw crushers, hammer mills, roller mills, disc disintegrators and 
              especially ball mills are discussed at length, together with useful 
              detail to do with ball sizes, speed of grinding and the wonderfully 
              termed &#8216;angle of nip&#8217;. There is a revised version of 
              his Thoroughly Modern Milling, first published in Pottery in Australia 
              vol. 15. no&#8217;s 1 and 2 in 1976, which surely must be the last 
              word on the subject. Furthermore &#8211; and this is where Harrison&#8217;s 
              book delves into hitherto unexplored regions &#8211; he outlines 
              a method by which constituent minerals, for example feldspar and 
              silica, may be separated from the parent rock through a combination 
              of mechanical and chemical treatments. Given the chemicals and labour 
              involved this procedure will not appeal to most potters, but it 
              is a fascinating account, and one which stresses his dedication 
              to the cause. The remainder of the book addresses a variety of subjects, 
              from testing procedures to glaze chemistry, in brief but informative 
              terms, and one might wish to follow Harrison&#8217;s advice &#8211; 
              and footnotes &#8211; in assembling a more extensive library on 
              differing aspects of glaze technology or mineralogical analysis. 
              What Steve Harrison does is to concentrate on one specific facet 
              of ceramic inquiry, whilst locating it within a general field, and 
              he does it well.</p>
            <p>What he does not do is delve into the philosophy behind his approach 
              (which he terms a &#8216;location specific event&#8217; ) for the 
              stated reason that he has addressed this topic in his other writings. 
              I found further explanation of his philosophy of &#8216;locality&#8217; 
              on the Legge Gallery website, and couldn't help comparing 
              his arguments with those made by Ivan McMeekin in his Introduction 
              to Notes for Potters in Australia. There, McMeekin states one of 
              the primary reasons for writing his book was because</p>
            <p>&#8216;artist-potters &#8230; in Australia are in a position that 
              is different from that of their fellows in Europe or America &#8230; 
              (insofar that) &#8230; in England, the pottery industry has been 
              in existence for so long that the nature and whereabouts of most 
              of their raw materials is well known, and you can work there as 
              an artist-potter knowing little more about your clay than its forming 
              and firing characteristics, and that you got it from such and such 
              supplier, if you wish &#8230;&#8217;. </p>
            <p>The inference being that Australian potters were somewhat disadvantaged 
              in this respect, although, given that McMeekin&#8217;s book was 
              published in 1985, it is arguable that by the mid-eighties Australian 
              potters had access to a truly vast range of materials, both local 
              and imported. Nonetheless, his emphasis is on assembling knowledge 
              for the sake of knowledge, </p>
            <p>&#8216;in the hope that this study of our materials may lead us 
              to knowledge of and feeling for not only the clays and rocks but 
              the Australian environment as a whole; and that we may come to identify 
              ourselves more with it, becoming more concerned about it and responsible 
              for it.&#8217; </p>
            <p>Fine sentiments indeed.</p>
            <p>Harrison&#8217;s arguments are couched in somewhat more trenchant 
              terms, positing the use of &#8216;local&#8217; materials as an antidote 
              to globalization, and the resultant aesthetic sameness in contemporary 
              work. He states that </p>
            <p>&#8216;In a time when international cultural boundaries are being 
              smudged or collapsed by free trade agreements and globalization, 
              one result is that simple consumer items such as ceramics are conceived 
              in a design studio in Europe or the US and produced in a factory 
              in China, then shipped to every first-world country in the developed 
              world. The result is less choice, less individuality. This work 
              is my attempt to produce a fully local product. With all its limitations 
              and faults, and all of its local character. The French have a word 
              &#8216;terroir&#8217; that expresses some of this quality.&#8217; 
            </p>
            <p>One might point out that the smudging of cultural boundaries is 
              not always a bad thing. Ceramics, tailored specifically for foreign 
              markets, have been produced in China and shipped around the world 
              for a very long time, and constitute some of the most beautiful 
              wares in ceramic history, though the standard seems to have been 
              slipping over the last few hundred years. Harrison&#8217;s work 
              itself is the result of a fortuitous smudging of cultural boundaries, 
              stemming as it does from the Anglo-Oriental tradition. It is worth 
              remembering that one of Leach&#8217;s great ambitions was the bringing 
              together of East and West, yet, whilst his transposition of oriental 
              stoneware techniques was highly influential in the West, the Japanese 
              audience favored his English slip-ware, &#8216;born&#8217;, as Yanagi 
              rather diplomatically put it, &#8216;not made.&#8217; Lastly, it 
              is highly unlikely the monopoly of a global ceramic industry, offering 
              less choice and individuality, will be challenged by exhibiting 
              $500 soup bowls, no matter what their geological DNA. As a political 
              theorist Harrison is less than convincing. Where he is very convincing 
              is in his work, and this is where one really sees the benefits of 
              his theories of locality.</p>
            <p>Where I am absolutely in agreement with Harrison, is in the aesthetic 
              possibilities made possible by the use of un-refined materials. 
              If one favors the personality and individuality brought to a pot 
              by the inclusion of a little quartz, mica or iron in the body, or 
              the unexpected qualities of glazes made with rock and ash, then 
              there is nothing better than Harrison&#8217;s approach. It also 
              returns to the potter a freedom and confidence which only comes 
              through hands on experience, hopefully translating into work exhibiting 
              similar qualities. Of course, it is up to the individual to decide 
              just what is &#8216;local&#8217;, and an argument that rests too 
              heavily on this concept will be difficult to sustain. After all, 
              it is perfectly possible to live &#8211; as I do &#8211; within 
              a short drive of quarries that supply primary and secondary clays, 
              limestone and quartz, graded, milled and bagged, yet despite this 
              proximity I doubt whether their use would fall within Harrison&#8217;s 
              definition of a &#8216;location specific event&#8217;. What is more 
              interesting is his use of the analogy of a &#8216;terroir&#8217;, 
              referring as it does to a complex interaction of place, product 
              and tradition. Here, Harrison&#8217;s ideals share more than a little 
              with the burgeoning &#8216;slow food&#8217; movement in Australia, 
              as he indicates by comparing the use of local produce with local 
              materials. Other similarities exist, for example the concept of 
              &#8216;food miles&#8217;, or indeed the willingness of certain members 
              of the public to pay a premium for an organic, hand-made product. 
              As yet, there are no distinct appellations in Australian ceramics, 
              but, given the history, I wouldn't be surprised if the area around 
              Mittagong would be the first. </p>
