              <img src="images/sexpots_cover.jpg" alt="sex Pots" width="167" height="214" align="left"> 
              Pottery books invariably discuss things like form, function, decoration 
              and technique. But sex? This sounds like a novel idea. It may seem 
              surprising to some just how strong a role sex has played, and continues 
              to play in ceramics. Ceramics have an exceptional relationship to 
              sexuality and the human body. Think of the analogy of their forms 
              to the body, with the function to contain, pour, dispense and dispose, 
              the sensuality of the material - soft, slippery, hard when fired. 
              &quot;That many ... vessels have sexual attributes comes as no surprise.&quot;
            <p>In his book <em>Sex Pots</em>, Paul Mathieu grasps the bull by the 
              horns and takes us on a journey to look at the influence of sex 
              and sexuality in pottery of the past through to the present day. 
              He observes that there is an &quot;interesting predominance of ceramics 
              in erotic representations worldwide&quot; and traces the historical 
              trail of erotic ceramics with their connections to daily life, social 
              and religious rituals and the cycle of life and death. Many of these 
              themes are as valid today as in previous ages and are expressed 
              by a range of contemporary ceramists.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/breast_bowl.jpg" alt="18th C 'Breast Bowl'" width="300" height="334"></p>
            <p>Mathieu begins his account of erotic ceramics with the justified 
              lament: &quot;I wish I did not have to write this book, that there 
              was no real need for it&quot;, because other books on the topic 
              of erotic art &quot;largely ignore ceramics and other crafts ... 
              and they usually include very few, if any, examples of ceramic objects&quot;. 
              However, as the reader will discover, a great deal of ceramic artists 
              past and present, many of them well-known, have dealt with sexual 
              issues in their ceramics.</p>
            <p>In the following chapters Mathieu deals in depth with various 
              aspects of sexuality in ceramics.</p>
            <p>The first chapter &quot;Making Histories&quot; covers sexuality 
              in historical ceramics, beginning with the Neolithic (around 15,000 
              BC), Greek and Roman works, Pre-Columbian pottery, Asian works and 
              other areas and eras up to the present. One wonders how Mathieu 
              has found some of the pieces depicted here. Many of them are amusing, 
              many erotic and - perhaps surprisingly - many are quite inspirational 
              works from throughout the ages and representing all kinds of sexual 
              practices. The research is meticulous and the results very enlightening. 
              Amongst many other items, you will find a 'Male Genital Vessel' 
              from Peru from around 400 BC and a 'Breast Bowl' (depicted above) 
              from 18th century France.</p>
            <p>This is followed by a comparison of sexuality in Native American 
              pottery and American ceramics of the present day, from Mimbres to 
              Michael Lucero and others. Of course the Greeks should not be forgotten 
              in any account of the history of erotic ceramics. Most of us are 
              familiar with Greek 'Red on Black' and Bal ck on Red' wares and 
              some of us may have seen images of sexuality on Greek pottery. Mathieu 
              (deservedly) devotes a whole sub-chapter to the Greeks and Romans, 
              but as with other chapters, interestingly and intelligently cross-references 
              and compares the ancient works with contemporary pieces, drawing 
              parallels from then to now.</p>
            <p><img src="images/george_ohr.jpg" alt="Vagina Bank by George Ohr" width="182" height="129" align="left">After 
              a brief look at India and China, where sexual taboos have probably 
              stifled such creativity to a degree, Mathieu moves on to an analysis 
              of 19th and 20th century Western ceramics, in particular the works 
              of George Ohr and Pablo Picasso (who by the way said &quot;Art and 
              sex, it's all the same&quot;). Picasso, whose pottery plays an important, 
              if underrated role in the history of ceramics, used sex as a theme 
              in his paintings as well as in his clay work. George Ohr, also known 
              as 'The Mad Potter of Biloxi', also used sexual themes in some of 
              his sculptural work. Ohr created a 'Vagina Bank' (depicted above), 
              which, as Mathieu says, &quot;brings together power and sex, money 
              and desire, with amazing directness&quot;. Ohr was inspired by feminine 
              powers of creation and reproduction, a theme to be observed in many 
              societies in regards to the relationship between pottery and sexuality.</p>
            <p>The second chapter, &quot;Getting Lucky&quot;, was written by Catherine 
              Hess, Assistant Curator, Department of Sculpture and works of Art 
              at the Getty Museum, LA. Her analysis covers the heyday of Italian 
              Maiolica, between the 15th and 17th centuries. Hess gives four main 
              reasons for the depiction of sexuality in Italian maiolica (and 
              these probably still apply today): as a depiction of pleasure; as 
              a depiction of victimization or disgrace; as a depiction of dominating 
              sexual desires; and as symbols of fertility.</p>
            <p>Mathieu's next chapter &quot;Giving Meaning&quot; deals mostly 
              with contemporary works that deal with the sexual-political or social 
              issues of our times. These range from sexual identity and orientation 
              to women's rights, bodily functions, hygiene, power, rape, pornography, 
              morality and HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <p>The chapter &quot;Creating desire&quot; deals with popular culture, 
              common notions of beauty, objectification, advertising and merchandising, 
              consumerism and desire. Here Mathieu talks about fame, mass-culture 
              and in that respect, ceramics' relationship to sexuality. 'Telling 
              Stories&quot; deals with clay in creation myths, scatology, trans-gender 
              and trans-sexual issues, while &quot;Touching Bodies&quot; discusses 
              hygiene, sickness, death, body fluids, queer sexuality and gender 
              roles. Mathieu discusses the idea of associations between vessel 
              forms and the human body, a recurring theme in the book, in detail.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/imre_schrammel.jpg" alt="Imre Schrammel, Early Spring, 1991" width="300" height="216"></p>
            <p>Chapter seven, &quot;Growing things&quot; deals with other, more 
              ephemeral issues, such as transformation and change, transitions 
              and permanence and what Mathieu refers to as 'Organic Formalism', 
              in which he sees organic forms - plants, flowers, bacteria, geology 
              and other 'organic systems' - as carriers of sexual references. 
              Mathieu also touches upon another recurring theme - the sensuality 
              and sexuality of clay and associated forming processes, perceived 
              erotic gestures, forms and vocabulary as well as the vessel as manifestation 
              or representation of the female form.</p>
            <p><img src="images/kukuli_velarde.jpg" alt="Kukuli Velarde, 'The Virgin Bride, 1998" width="200" height="189" align="left">Throughout 
              the book, Mathieu intelligently supports his ideas with quotes from 
              the likes of Immanuel Kant, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Michel 
              Foucault, Donald Winnicott and others. The contemporary artists 
              represented are as diverse as they are surprising. They range from 
              <a href="../potw/grayson_perry.html">Grayson Perry</a> (UK), who
              recently won the prestigious and controversial 'Turner Prize', to 
              Patti Warashina (USA), and from Imre Schrammel (Hungary; depicted 
              above)) to L&eacute;opold Foulem (Canada) to name a few. Actually 
              there are too many artists to list here. And this is where surprise 
              may set in - you may have come across a sexually themed work here 
              or there, but <em>Sex Pots</em> is a real eye-opener as far as the 
              prevalence of the theme in ceramics goes. Sexual references in the 
              works presented are often subtle, but they are just as often direct 
              and confronting.</p>
            <p> You may want to leave this book on your coffee table for some 
              assured amusement and as a topic of conversation with visitors, 
              but <em>Sex Pots</em> is no lightweight publication. The text is 
              well-written and the images well chosen to illustrate the various 
              topics and ideas presented. Mathieu can be congratulated for writing 
              a comprehensive, well-researched book on a neglected topic.</p>
            <p><em>Sex Pots, Eroticism in Ceramics</em>, by Paul Mathieu, was 
              published by A&amp;C Black in 2003. ISBN 07136-5804-5</p>
