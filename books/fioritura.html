              Maiolica's Heyday - A Berlin Collection<br>
              Author: Tjark Hausmann <br>
              Review by Steven Goldate</p>
            <p><img src="images/fioritura_cover.jpg" alt="Fioritura" width="125" height="152" align="left">Within 
              the rich history of world ceramics, maiolica is a fascinating area 
              of study. Those who have studied Italian maiolica of the 15th-17th 
              centuries cannot help but be captivated by the timeless beauty of 
              the Italian Renaissance masters of painting on tin-white glaze.</p>
            <p>Influenced by potters from Eastern Spain, maiolica developed in 
              Italy in the 15th century, reaching its zenith (Fioritura) in the 
              16th century. A tin-white glaze covered a yellow to brown clay and 
              presented a canvas on which to paint cobalt blues, copper greens, 
              iron reds, browns and yellows in different shades. Motifs ranged 
              from family crests to portraits, ornamental designs to flora and 
              fauna, religious motifs and scenes from the legends and myths of 
              antiquity, popular during the period. Soon gold luster was also 
              added to the palette. Many designs were executed on platters, the 
              image following the shape of the rim, with a central design in the 
              middle. Grotesques were another popular motif and in the latter 
              period landscapes became more common.</p>
            <p>While platters, with their relatively flat surface, offered an 
              ideal canvas for decoration, other forms such as jugs, vases and 
              albarellos (the characteristic Italian &#8216;waisted&#8217; apothecary 
              jar) were also popular. Different regions specialized in certain 
              motifs. Montelupo, Caffagiolo and Siena concentrated on antique 
              mythology and ornament, in Faenza, urban scenes and pageantry were 
              popular, while in Deruta, beautiful maidens and religious scenes 
              abounded. Other famous areas of maiolica production centered on 
              Gubbio, Castel Durante, Urbino and Pesaro.</p>
            <p><img src="images/fioritura_albarello.jpg" alt="Albarello" width="144" height="226" align="left">According 
              to the authors, Italian maiolica began a slow descent after around 
              1540. Masterworks were still being made, but became scarcer as time 
              went on. Centers of activity shifted to Sicily in the middle of 
              <br>
              the 16th century, then to Naples in the 17th century.</p>
            <p>There are not many significant collections of Italian maiolica 
              outside of the country, however the &#8216;Berlin Collection&#8217; 
              is considered such a one. Whom this private collection actually 
              belongs to is intriguingly never mentioned. There is only talk of 
              a mysterious &#8216;head of the household&#8217; &#8211; obviously 
              a euphemism for a collector of no small means, judging by the value 
              of many of the pieces described in the book.</p>
            <p>Tjark Hausmann&#8217;s Fioritura, which can be translated as &#8216;heyday&#8217;, 
              is not a book written in a narrative style but rather a catalogue 
              of one man&#8217;s collection. Each double-spread page depicts and 
              describes in detail a particular work and what is known of its maker. 
              It begins with early Spanish tin-glaze and works its way through 
              Italy&#8217;s main maiolica regions. In the course of this survey, 
              we encounter many familiar names: Cipriana Picolpasso, Della Robbia, 
              Guido di Savino, Nicola di Gabriele Sbraga and many other masters, 
              as well as lesser known painters.</p>
            <p>This oversize volume is replete with high-quality reproductions 
              of magnificent examples of Italian maiolica and is a joy to behold 
              &#8211; and read, if you understand German. While the language barrier 
              may be a drawback for some, this publication is nonetheless a must 
              for any serious scholar of Italian maiolica or lover of the genre.</p>
