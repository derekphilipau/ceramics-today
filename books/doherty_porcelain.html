              Review by Steven Goldate 
            <p><img src="images/doherty1.jpg" alt="Jack Doherty, Porcelain" width="135" height="205" align="left">Jack 
              Doherty's <i>Porcelain</i> is another in the 'Ceramics Handbooks' 
              series by A&amp;C Black (Published in the USA by the University 
              of Pennsylvania Press). It's a neat introduction to the topic for 
              the student, hobby artist or budding studio potter. 
            <p>Doherty introduces us to the material via its origins in China's 
              Tang dynasty (618-906 AD) and its peak during the Sung Dynasty (960-1279 
              AD), the spread to Europe and the subsequent 'porcelain craze' of 
              the 17th century. This is followed by the development of European 
              porcelain and its triumphant march through 18th century Europe. 
            <p>After dealing with porcelain's general history, Doherty turns his 
              attention to the development of studio porcelain. Beginning with 
              Bernard Leach and his 'Sung Standard', he traces the rise of porcelain 
              as a preferred material for many accomplished studio potters - Lucie 
              Rie, David Leach, Geoffrey Whiting, Harry Davis, Mary Rogers, Rudi 
              Staffel and many others.
            <p>This concludes the historical section, and the author now delves 
              into technical side, covering materials, bodies, forming processes, 
              decoration types, firing methods and glazes. 
            <p><img src="images/doherty2.jpg" alt="Assembling a large pot" width="168" height="135" align="left">While 
              at first it may appear strange to mix historical fact with technical 
              know-how, the idea begins to make sense when we look at the target 
              audience of the 'Ceramics Handbooks' range, as stated on the back 
              cover: &quot;The books are aimed at the student or practiced ceramist 
              who is experimenting in a new area&quot;. I would also add to this 
              list 'the serious hobby potter'. In that respect, it makes sense 
              to introduce the topic with some history and analysis of modern 
              work, providing inspiration to develop something interesting with 
              the new material. 
            <p>The following chapters provide some of the necessary technical 
              knowledge to work with a difficult body.
            <ul>
              <li>Materials: a brief chapter outlining the base materials which 
                most porcelain bodies are formulated from.</li>
              <li>Porcelain Bodies: Provides a description of commercial manufacturing 
                processes and how to make your own porcelain in the studio. This 
                chapter includes hints on how to achieve the various properties 
                you are looking for in a porcelain body - translucency, whiteness, 
                vitrification, etc., while at the same time retaining plasticity.</li>
              <li>Forming Methods: covers wheel-throwing, hand-building, slip-casting, 
                joining, altering, composite forms and tools.</li>
              <li>Decoration: looks at how to decorate leather-hard porcelain, 
                how to add color, apply slips and how to paint on porcelain.</li>
              <li>Firing Processes: explains the full range of firing techniques 
                suitable for porcelain, ranging from once-firing to oxidation 
                in an electric kiln, reduction firing in a wood-firing kiln and 
                even salt and soda-glazing. All of these approaches are valid 
                and can yield great results.</li>
              <li>Glaze: this chapter concludes the technical section. A number 
                of glaze recipes are offered, which are suitable for the various 
                possible firing scenarios. Also includes some helpful notes on 
                glaze application.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="images/doherty3.jpg" alt="Michael Flymm, The Lies that Parrots Tell" width="148" height="170" align="left">The 
              final chapter 'Contemporary Approaches' offers a modern perspective 
              and another opportunity to be inspired by what present-day ceramists 
              are doing with the material. Julian Stair (UK), Janet De Boos (Australia), 
              Ryoji Koie (Japan) and Pieter Stockmans (Netherlands) are a few 
              of those mentioned that display a sensibility appropriate to the 
              medium.</p>
