                <td><p>Having known Robert Yellin through his website on Japanese 
                    ceramics <a href="http://e-yakimono.net"><b>e-yakimono.net</b></a> 
                    for some time now, I eagerly awaited the arrival of his hot-off-the-press 
                    book <a href="http://www.japanesepottery.com/Site_Map/book-yellin/book-yellin.html"><i><b>Ode 
                    to Japanese Pottery</b></i></a>. I was not disappointed. On 
                    opening the package, an enticing setting of sake cup and bottle 
                    peered at me through Japanese rice paper wrapping promising 
                    more treats inside. 
                  <p>There are various books on the Japanese tea ceremony and 
                    its associated ceramic utensils, but not many on ceramics 
                    made for storing and drinking that other equally, if not more 
                    popular Japanese brew, sake. Yellin's book redresses this 
                    void by taking us on a journey through the world of Japanese 
                    pottery via the ceramic sake utensil.</p>

                <td><p>After moving to Japan in 1984, Yellin became a collector 
                    of sake cups and flasks. His first cup cost around $3, but 
                    as his appreciation of Japanese pottery grew, more expensive 
                    ones followed. In the process, Yellin became a serious collector 
                    and connoisseur of Japanese pottery in general and 'guinomi' 
                    (sake cups) and 'tokkuri' (sake flasks) in particular. 
                  <p>While the focus of this book is on sake cups and flasks, 
                    it is by no means limited to that topic. Its sixteen chapters 
                    range from Japanese cuisine and associated pottery to Zen 
                    and nature. Shino, Bizen, Tokoname and many other regional 
                    styles are covered with the help of entries on particularly 
                    noteworthy potters and high quality images illustrating their 
                    guinomi and tokkuri.</td>

                <td> <p>There are too many potters featured to mention all of 
                    them, but amongst them you will find many familiar names such 
                    as Suzuki Goro, Fujiwara Ken, Otani Shiro, Kanzaki Shiho and 
                    many others. Yellin also recognizes the contribution of foreign 
                    potters inspired by the Japanese aesthetic, with the inclusion 
                    of Americans Jeff Shapiro and Richard Bennett and Korean Chi 
                    Soon Taek (1912-1993). There are also chapters devoted to 
                    individual potters, notably Furutani Michio and Okuiso Eiroku.</p>
                  <p>Individual entries in this book are devoted to particular 
                    images of a cup or flask, analyzing their history and merits 
                    and saying a few words about the maker. Techniques are also 
                    covered, from 'neriage' (a Japanese marbling technique) to 
                    'mentori' (giving shape by cutting and trimming).</p></td>

            <p><img src="images/Yellin_pic.jpg" width="125" height="152" align="right">Yellin 
              also speaks of his personal relationship to particular bowls, and 
              describes how he has become 'acquainted' with certain potters by 
              using their bowls, although never having physically met them. This 
              book too, reveals something of Yellin's own personality. Be it through 
              his descriptions or interpretations of yakimono, his musings on 
              philosophy and spirituality in Japan and his own personal journey 
              there, or his lament of a rapidly changing Japanese society, the 
              author establishes an intimate relationship with the reader.</p>
            <p>Actually, I don't know how Yellin manages to pack so much information 
              into a book of this size. It reminds me of what an old school teacher 
              of mine used to say about essays. Some have too much waffle and 
              not many raisins. <i>Ode to Japanese Pottery</i> is all raisins!</p>
