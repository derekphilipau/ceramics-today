              </b>by Zhang Yushan. Review by Steven Goldate<br>
            <p><img src="images/contemporary_public_ceramics.jpg" width="206" height="282" align="left">In 
              recent times there has been much talk in the West about China. It 
              is seen as the new economic powerhouse of the world, a rising star 
              in so many fields, alongside, but ahead of India. China will be 
              hosting the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 - a momentous occasion to 
              present itself to the broader global community, an opportunity to 
              claim its place as a world leader. 
            <p>I have been told that many things have changed in China in the 
              past few decades. These changes also include the unparalleled rise 
              of studio pottery, a relatively new phenomenon there. Don&#8217;t 
              misunderstand this - China is one of the great cradles of pottery 
              and the birthplace of porcelain. Ceramics were (and still are) practised 
              by the anonymous craft potter, but also by reputable masters, in 
              such pottery towns as Yixing and Jingdezhen. A few decades ago, 
              the Western concept of studio pottery was little known in China. 
              Since opening up to the West in the 1970s, the craft scene has spawned 
              a healthy studio pottery movement. </p>
            <p>There are now hundreds of successful ceramic artists and studio 
              potters, not to mention the thousands of folk potters in China. 
              We in the West can only benefit from contact with these artists 
              and their projects. And it also works the other way. These artists 
              are hungry for information and stimulus from their peers and colleagues 
              around the globe. They may ask &#8220;what is going on in the pottery 
              scenes of Norway, Venezuela, Australia or elsewhere?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Zhang Yushan&#8217;s book <i>World Contemporary Public Ceramic 
              Art</i> addresses a very important aspect of world ceramic art hitherto 
              not written about in China - that of public sculpture. His work 
              is encyclopaedic in scope, spanning 30 countries on five continents, 
              with biographical details on 130 artists. And of course, Chinese 
              ceramists making public art are well represented.</p>
            <p><img src="images/contemporary_public_ceramics2.jpg" width="291" height="373" align="right">An 
              introduction by well-known American ceramic artist Vice-president 
              of the International Academy of Ceramics Wayne Higby precedes four 
              main chapters: Architectural Ceramics and Murals, Outdoor Ceramic 
              Sculpture, Installations, Landscape Ceramics and Brickwork. Within 
              these chapters, each artist has at least a single page, often a 
              larger spread with up to a dozen high-quality photos of their work.</p>
            <p>This is the first and only Chinese language book of its kind available 
              today. It&#8217;s an impressive, large format high-quality glossy 
              publication with more than 240 pages. To mention a selection of 
              the 130 represented artists would be to do the others a disservice. 
              Suffice it to say that here you will find most high-profile public 
              ceramic artists with an international reputation, as well as a few 
              pleasant surprises. It is enlightening to see just what a huge role 
              ceramics play in the realm of public art.</p>
            <p>Please note that this book is written mostly in Chinese, so it 
              is primarily for that market. However, artists&#8217; names and 
              country of origin are also provided in English and the images speak 
              a thousand words in any language. For the non-Mandarin speaker, 
              World Contemporary Public Ceramic Art still represents an insightful 
              look into, and intriguing perspective on the world of public sculpture 
              and will be an important reference work for anyone researching international 
              ceramics or public art.</p>
