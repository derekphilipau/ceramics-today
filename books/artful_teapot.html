              Review by Steven Goldate
            <p><i><img src="images/artful_teapot.jpg" alt="The Artful Teapot" width="178" height="238" align="left">The 
              Artful Teapot</i> was published to accompany the major travelling 
              show of the same name, which has toured Canada and the USA and can 
              be viewed at the Mint Museum of Craft and Design in Charlotte, North 
              Carolina, until June 1, 2004. The exhibition and book draw on the 
              extensive collection of Sonny and Gloria Kamm - with around 6,000 
              pieces probably the largest collection of one-of-a-kind art teapots 
              in the world. <br>
              <br>
              Those who were unable to visit the show may console themselves with 
              Clark's publication, which offers not only the opportunity to view 
              many of the works in 2D, but also gives various insights into the 
              discourses surrounding the world of tea, from its at times tumultuous, 
              4,000 year history ('Opium Wars'; the 'Boston Tea Party'), its ritualistic, 
              pseudo-religious aspects (the Japanese Tea Ceremony; English 'High 
              Tea') or the 'romance of tea' - its association with exotic lands 
              and a perceived finesse, as exemplified by tea &quot;served in a 
              silver pot in the wood-panelled dining room of the Milan to Rome 
              express&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              Having touched upon the history and mystery of tea, Clark leads 
              us into the world of the art teapot with a look at Yixing and its 
              influence on the West. The Chinese Yixing teapot is really in a 
              class of its own. Various scholars have written about it, numerous 
              websites are dedicated to it and many a potter have been inspired 
              by it. Most notable of these is perhaps American ceramist Richard 
              Notkin, who, appropriating the Yixing style, created a body of modern, 
              socio-critical works, e.g. his iconic 'Double Cooling Tower Teapot'. 
              Other artists mentioned in this category range from modern Yixing 
              master Dingfang Zhou to Dutch ceramist Jeroen Bechtold. <br>
              <br>
              The teapot developed in China around the 16th century. In the West, 
              elegant teapots were wrought in silver during the 18th century and 
              Staffordshire potteries created whimsical cauliflower or pineapple 
              shaped teapots. The passion for the artistic teapot has certainly 
              not waned over the centuries, reflecting tea's unshakeable cosmopolitan 
              position as the world's leading hot beverage. <br>
              <br>
              One can broadly divide art teapots into two categories: functional 
              and non-functional. Form and function have been a concern in modern 
              design since the early 20th century (if not earlier), culminating 
              in Walter Gropius' ultra-elegant teapot 'TAC1', but also evident 
              in the work of eminent British potter Bernard Leach or America's 
              'mad potter of Biloxi' George E. Ohr. <br>
              <br>
              Then again, art is not usually about function. Sometimes, like the 
              fashion conscious dresser who sacrifices comfort for style, the 
              teapot maker will sacrifice functionality for decorative effects 
              or concept. So the teapot leaves the realm of the dining room or 
              tea house and enters that of the gallery and museum. The possibilities 
              are endless, as the Kamm collection shows with some stunning examples. 
              <br>

              <img src="images/lazslo_fekete.jpg" alt="Lazslo Fekete, 'Resurrection of a Broken Teapot'" width="202" height="396" align="left">Among 
              these are Michael Lucero's bizarre dual 'Eye Ohr' teapots of 1993, 
              Ken Ferguson's 'Teapot with Turtle and Hare' of 1997, with a decidedly 
              mischievous looking spout, and Richard Milette's 'Teapot' of 1992, 
              which references several major ceramic traditions in the form of 
              trompe l'oeil shards. The teapot lends itself readily to this artistic 
              device, where one material imitates another. Ah Leon's works convincingly 
              mimic redwood, while Gail Ritchie's tea set looks like it's made 
              from birch bark. Paul Dresang's subliminally erotic 'Bag' of 1994 
              has a pot emerging from a faux pigskin bag, complete with ceramic 
              zipper.<br>
              <br>
              Other artists dispense of functionality altogether, working with 
              the concept of the teapot instead. In his mixed-media work 'Dear 
              Mother' (2000), Ron Baron creates an oversize statue of a teapot 
              on a pedestal, made from stacked cups, plates and other materials. 
              Lazslo Fekete's 'Resurrection of a Teapot' (2000; pictured) is an 
              homage to the teapot, reminiscent of elements of Hieronymus Bosch's 
              paintings. Piet Stockmans' irreverent 'Twenty-Five Teapots' of 2000 
              consists of cast and flattened teapots partly dipped in his signature 
              cobalt-blue slip. Hung neatly on a wall, they look like deflated 
              footballs. Then there are those artists who use what can only be 
              called 'impossible' materials, e.g. Daniel Chatt's beadwork 'Karilyn's 
              Tea Service' of 1997-98, Zoe Morrow's 'Five on the Line' of 1999, 
              made of woven five dollar bills, or John McQueen's basketwork 'Teaser-Vice' 
              (1999), made of twigs and string.<br>
              <br>
              With over 250 colour images, The Artful Teapot is not only an in-depth 
              look at the Kamm's impressive collection, but also a general survey 
              of the teapot throughout the ages (with an emphasis on the contemporary). 
              I would like to commend Garth Clark for the inclusion of a short 
              bio of each artist - often omitted in such publications - at the 
              rear of the book, giving the reader, if he/she so desires, the opportunity 
              to find out more about the artists featured. <br>
              <br>
              Cloth bound in oversize hardcover, this publication will be a fitting 
              addition to the tea lover's or teapot enthusiast's library, and 
              a good complement to Clark's previous book, <i>The Eccentric Teapot, 
              Four Hundred Years of Innovation</i>, published in 1989.<br>
