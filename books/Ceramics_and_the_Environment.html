            <p>Janet Mansfield's new book <i>Ceramics and the Environment</i> 
              is a tour of contemporary, mostly large-scale sculpture, often public, 
              sometimes private, commissioned by government bodies, architects 
              and more rarely, the private collector. It spans numerous countries, 
              from Australia to Iceland, from China to Finland.</p>
            <p>As can be seen above, Mansfield has divided her survey into bite-sized 
              chapters such as &quot;Introducing Sculpture in a Specific Environment&quot;, 
              &quot;In Harmony with Space&quot; or &quot;Monumental Concepts&quot;. 
              Each of these chapters approaches the topic from a slightly different 
              perspective, each with its own introduction, followed by a few artists 
              illustrating the point to be made.</p>
            <p>In her introduction to Chapter 1, Mansfield writes of the need 
              to bring public ceramic sculpture to the attention of a wider audience. 
              Yes, there is a need to draw attention to ceramic artists and ceramic 
              sculpture in the environment. Often ceramic sculpture is not recognized 
              as such - the work or concept becoming the central focal point, 
              the material secondary. But just as often, the maker sees him or 
              herself as a <i>ceramic</i> artist, i.e. one who primarily uses 
              ceramic materials and techniques. This is one of the prevailing 
              oddities of the ceramic arts - the loyalty to the material. And 
              yet, this loyalty is perhaps no more odd, than that of the painter, 
              who swears by oil paint over acrylics. Of course there are also 
              those ceramic artists, who have worked with or even wholly migrated 
              to other media and those (fine) artists, who have dabbled with the 
              ceramic medium, but they are not who this book is about.</p>
            <p><img src="images/Hole2.jpg" width="256" height="400" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">As 
              Mansfield states in her introduction, the genesis of this book lay 
              in the Australian ceramics event in 1995 &quot;ClaySculpt Gulgong&quot;, 
              where 22 international ceramists were invited to do their stuff 
              with and in the environment of rural New South Wales, creating a 
              sculpture park in the process. Many of those artists are represented 
              in the book.</p>
            <p>Some in my view interesting, if not fascinating works and concepts 
              stand out, e.g.&quot;'kiln as performance&quot;. Perhaps the best 
              known representative of the genre is Danish ceramist Nina Hole, 
              whose large-scale abstract or architectural sculptures are wrapped 
              in ceramic fibre and spectacularly fired in-situ at night (left), 
              transforming the event into part of the work, the sculpture into 
              performance.</p>

            <p><img src="images/Caruso3.jpg" width="234" height="283" hspace="10" align="right"></p>
            <p>A recurring element in large-scale ceramic sculpture is the multiple, 
              often in the form of the tile, sometimes other more solid segments 
              (such as in the work of Nino Caruso). This is often due to the limitations 
              of kiln size. Once the work reaches dimensions that can no longer 
              be accommodated by the kiln, the ceramic artist may work in segments, 
              which are assembled post-firing, as in Nino Caruso's assembled monumental 
              works referencing ancient architecture (left), Ulla Viotti's work 
              in assembled bricks or Ole Lislerud's monumental porcelain tile 
              claddings.</p>

            <p>A chapter of particular interest to me is &quot;Expressing Care 
              for the Earth&quot;, in which Mansfield highlights a number of ceramists 
              concerned with environmental issues or just imbued with and inspired 
              by a general empathy with mother nature or the planet. Of these, 
              Sadashi Inuzuka's installations concerning issues of global water 
              shortages, or as he says in more general terms, &quot;the relationship 
              between human nature and nature itself&quot;, stand out (left).</p>
            <p><img src="images/Kuipers3.jpg" alt="Michel Kuipers" width="313" height="214" align="left">Amongst 
              my favorite works in this book is Belgian ceramist Michel Kuipers' 
              &quot;Still Life&quot; (left). Turning not only 17th century still lifes, 
              or those of Morandi, but also those of Gywn Hanssen-Pigott on their 
              heads, Kuipers work consists of four large-scale vessels situated 
              in a residential environment. The 'vessels' are framed by an even 
              larger empty frame - intelligently creating a potentially dynamic 
              'still life' (e.g. if someone were to walk into the 'picture', or 
              a bird were to perch on one of the vessels).</p>
            <p><i>Ceramics and the Environment</i> is a bit like Kuipers' still 
              life - a snap shot or freeze-frame of contemporary public sculpture.</p>
