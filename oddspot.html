                    century BC. The original is also known as the Barberini vase. 
                    The vase was found near Rome in an ancient marble sarcophagus. 
                    After passing through several hands, it was acquired by the 
                    Duke of Portland, by whose name it is known today. </p>

                    It seems there is no limit to the use of ceramics in technology, 
                    be it for peaceful purposes or otherwise. Ultrahard ceramic 
                    layers are built into the steel in tank bodies. When a projectile 
                    penetrates a layer, it pulverizes the ceramic, breaking the 
                    bonds that bind the molecules together. This chemical change 
                    causes the ceramic fragments to expand. In expanding, they 
                    grind up the softer material of the projectile, making it 
                    inoperative.</p>

                    Canadian ceramist Kathy Venter's bizarre ceramic 'Immersion

                    floating under water. It is left to the viewer's imagination 
                    to figure out due to which circumstances they are immersed 
                    in water. Despite a faint smile on one face, that fact that 
                    they are wearing clothes would indicate that these 'people' 
                    drowned... Non-the-less, Venter's interpretation of the effects

                    John Brickles creates hyper-realistic buildings made from 
                    slabs of clay. Walls are cut out from the slabs, stood up 
                    and joined at the corners with slip. Windows are cut out and 
                    textures added. Bricks are inscribed with a needle and ruler. 
                    Boards and shingles are extruded from a clay gun and are attached 
                    individually.</p>

                    In 19th century Staffordshire, the 'muffin maker' was a potteries 
                    worker, who specialized in making small plates less then 7 
                    inches (18 cm) in diameter. The plates were made on a mold, 
                    in a jigger/jolley fashion. The 'mold runner', usually a young 
                    boy of as little as 9-10 years of age, would take the mold 
                    with its newly formed plate to a drying room and bring another 
                    blank.</p>

                    Paper usually contains kaolin, calcium carbonate or clay as 
                    a filller and 'whitener'. Therefore, when making paperclay, 
                    one might have to consider changes to the maturing temperature 
                    of the clay due to the extra 'raw' materials added with the 
                    paper. The maturing temperature may go up or down, dpending 
                    on the original maturing temperature of the clay and the composition 
                    of the paper.</p>

                    The Piggy Bank probably derives its name from the orange clay, 
                    &quot;pygg&quot; from which it was originally made. By the 
                    turn of the eighteenth century, the jars had acquired the 
                    name of &quot;pig banks&quot;. They were ceramic and had no 
                    hole in the bottom, so the pig had to be broken to get the 
                    money out. To this day in some European countries, it is customary 
                    to give piggy banks as gifts because the belief is still held 
                    that pigs bring luck and good fortune.</p>

                    The mysterious face of a bearded man staring out from an ancient

                    the &quot;extraordinary discovery&quot; was a vital clue in 
                    mapping out how the South Pacific came to be inhabited some 
                    3000 years ago, suggesting the first direct link to islands 
                    some thousands of kilometres away. The researchers think the 
                    pottery was the work of the Lapita people, a long-lost race 
                    that originated near modern-day Taiwan then migrated to Polynesia.</p>

                    Delft, The Netherlands, people take their traditional pottery 
                    very seriously, as is attested by this car, painted in the 
                    classic Delft Blue style.</p></td>

                    According to Chinese symbolism, the dragon represents masculinity 
                    and the phoenix femininity. However in some Chinese folklore, 
                    the human race was created by Nu Wa, a half dragon, half women, 
                    who fashioned the first human beings out of clay.</p>

                    glazes originated in China before the Sung dynasty, in the 
                    region of the Chien Ch'i river, where they are known as Chien 
                    Yao or Jian Yao. The Japanese name Tenmokku (or Temmoku) is 
                    derived from 'T'iem Mu Shan', the 'Mountain of the Eye of 
                    Heaven', the location of a monastery in Chekiang province, 
                    China, where a tea ritual was performed using Jian bowls.

                    firings can attract the attention of the local fire department, 
                    especially in urban areas. One member of the Clayart Listserv, 
                    resident in Texas, had this suggestion: &quot;Work out what 
                    is legal and ordinary to burn, and tell the fire department 
                    that was the fuel. In Texas people barbecue with mesquite 
                    a lot, and there is often smoke at the beginning. For a pit 
                    firing I would add a few mesquite logs, which have a very 
                    distinctive odor, and voila! Nobody tells a Texan they can't 
                    barbecue...&quot; <font size="-2">HB</font></p>
