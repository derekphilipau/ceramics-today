              Japanese pottery boxes are works of art in their own right.<br>
              Report by Robert Yellin 
            <p> In the West, one never really pays much attention to the box after 
              receiving a gift or after making a purchase for oneself. It's simply 
              there to hold the contents and then be thrown away. It doesn't really 
              tell us anything about the contents other than possibly the status 
              of the store. </p>
            <p>Not so for most Japanese goods. Wrapping here in Japan is a very 
              serious business. The box for most artwork is a work of art in itself 
              and often has splendid calligraphy written by the potter.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/boxes/box2.jpg" alt="Pottery box" width="300" height="300"> 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              An interesting anecdote concerning Japanese wooden boxes concerns 
              the eccentric potter-gourmet Rosanjin. On a trip to Europe in 1954, 
              he paid a visit to Picasso. This is how Sidney Cardozo writes about 
              that encounter in his book The Art of Rosanjin. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>When Rosanjin did call on Picasso, he brought this most renowned 
                Western artist an example of his potting. Naturally it was in 
                the finest of paulownia wood boxes. Picasso was fascinated by 
                the smoothness of the wood and glowed with pleasure as he stroked 
                the surface. Impatiently, Rosanjin thundered &quot;Not the box, 
                not the box, you simple child! What I made is inside the box!&quot; 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I can't imagine who was more surprised. As a side note, a master 
              craftsman usually makes the box, smoothing the surface and joining 
              it with wooden nails or just by joinery alone to other parts. </p>
            <p>The potter will carefully select a tying rope that adds a little 
              class to the package as well as for keeping the lid in place. There 
              is a certain way to put the lid on and how to tie it. For example, 
              the below photo shows the grain of the box and the lid not matching 
              up. This is the improper way. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/boxes/box_wrong.jpg" alt="wrong box" width="226" height="241"> 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              But in the next photo, the grain matches up and forms a square. 
              This is the proper way.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/boxes/box_right.jpg" alt="right box" width="226" height="238"> 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Some potters even stamp the box and the lid to show where the sides 
              should line up. </p>
            <p>The value of a box, moreover, plays a significant role in determining 
              the price of the contents. In Japan the value of an artwork can 
              be halved if there is no original signed box. If there's a box signed 
              by the artist's son or apprentice, this will also decrease the value 
              as opposed to a piece that was in an original box signed by the 
              artist himself. When we're talking about large ticket items, say 
              an Arakawa Toyozo chawan, it can mean the difference between quite 
              a handful of yen.</p>
            <p>So, that's one big reason to keep boxes in good condition. Further, 
              many galleries and collectors often wrap the boxes to keep them 
              in pristine condition ?and thus fetch a higher price.</p>
            <p>I had the misfortune once of having a few kittens relieve themselves 
              on a few boxes! How could this happen, you may ask. Well, in my 
              rather old Japanese home, I have a room with a small rectangular 
              closet located over a larger closet. I stored my boxes up there. 
              Most old Japanese homes utilize a post and beam construction, and 
              the roof often has an open area inside. One of my cats found a hole 
              in the roof or the straw-mud walls and got in. Then it found the 
              closet somehow and had a small litter. </p>
            <p>I thought I heard some meowing and sure enough, there they were, 
              snuggly curled up amongst my tomobako! Fur, wee-wee stains, the 
              whole package. I got them out, only after the mother darted out 
              of the closet, jumped nimbly between my pottery collection (nothing 
              got broken) and made it for the front door. Needless to say, I've 
              since covered up their entry tunnel. </p>
            <p>A box also protects a piece from moisture in the summer and other 
              natural elements.</p>
            <p><img src="images/boxes/box.jpg" width="167" height="253" align="left">As 
              many know, calligraphy is a highly respected art form in the east 
              and many a potter is also quite adept with a brush. Some of the 
              writing on boxes is wispy and gives off the feeling of incense smoke 
              drifting away (left). Others write with strokes that are bold and 
              forceful and imbued with a determined spontaneity (below). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/boxes/box_fujioka.jpg" width="287" height="275"></p>
            <p align="left">Many times a tomobako will have a piece of paper over 
              it. This is to protect the calligraphy.</p>
            <p>The writing usually begins on the upper right hand corner of the 
              side, or the top of the lid or underside of the lid. Some potters 
              even sign the bottom of the box itself, so be sure to give the box 
              a good looking over.</p>
            <p>The calligraphy can tell the style, the form, any special glazes, 
              the year, and the name of the kiln. Most potters usually sign only 
              their first name on the lower left.</p>
            <p>The box indeed plays a significant role in the value and protection 
              of most Japanese pottery, despite the fact that the greatest joy 
              comes from taking the piece out of the box and appreciating it in 
              our daily lives.</p>
            <p>Wait, don't throw that box out!</p>
