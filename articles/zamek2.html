              By Jeff Zamek II 
            <p align="center"><b><a href="zamek.html">Previous &gt; Time and Labor</a></b></p>
            <p>So now that we know that potters are on the tail end of the raw 
              material economy, we should realize it's not likely that potters 
              ever wag this dog. Instead, the best course of action is to pick 
              and choose carefully, using &quot;guaranteed&quot; clays and glaze 
              recipes whenever possible. Trouble-free glazes and clay bodies can 
              be formulated if potters learn to use their supply and demand strengths, 
              rather than being discouraged by choosing raw materials blindly. 
              A little knowledge in these areas will produce better results in 
              the pottery.</p>
            <p><b>Economic Strategies for Selling Pots</b><br>
              <img src="images/zamek/mass_produce%20_cup.jpg" alt="Mass Produced" width="175" height="158" align="left">How 
              can individual potters hope to overcome high labor cost, inferior 
              raw materials, and competition from mass-produced functional pottery? 
              As an added condition potters are faced with all the inherent problems 
              in financing and running a small business, many of which fail within 
              the first five years of operation. In order to sell pots in this 
              type of business environment much depends on a thorough understanding 
              of the general market and its smaller niche &quot;crafts&quot; markets. 
              The handmade &quot;one of a kind&quot; ceramic object produced by 
              a lone craftsman does not have a large market in the United States 
              as compared with mass produced, low priced, throwaway functional 
              objects which can be made from metal, plastic, ceramics or paper. 
              There is a smaller market for handmade ceramic objects, which the 
              potter must locate and develop in order to sell profitable functional 
              pottery. </p>
            <p>There are several strategies that can work to reduce cost and increase 
              profit margins. There are also several approaches to selling pottery 
              to small specialized markets. Many potters compile a list of customers 
              who have purchased their work in the past. A &quot;fine tuned&quot; 
              mailing list of satisfied customers can be used to send out postcards 
              and notices for upcoming shows and sales. Since the list is composed 
              of customers who have purchased work in the past they are more likely 
              to do so in the future. Many customers &quot;collect&quot; a potters 
              work over time and look for new pots to buy in the future. If it 
              is possible to have past and potential customers arrive at the pottery 
              studio for a kiln opening so much the better as this technique eliminates 
              shipping and handling costs for the potter. There is nothing more 
              satisfying for the potter than having someone take the pots out 
              of the studio and leave money in their place. Potters should realize 
              this economic fact: the more you touch the pots, the more they cost 
              to make.</p>
            <p>Craft shows which are held in many locations throughout the country 
              attract a wide ready made willing to buy audience of self selected 
              customers as they are purposely looking to buy hand made objects. 
              However, potters can fall into the trap of under pricing their pots 
              to people who are more than willing to buy them. What such a situation 
              provides is many labor intensively made pots selling at low profit 
              margins. There are many reasons for a miscalculation in determining 
              the fixed and variable costs in producing pottery. One factor is 
              the potters reluctance to not price their work out of the market. 
              They have not determined where their pricing falls on the supply 
              and demand curve. More importantly they have not availed themselves 
              of the potential increased profit margins because they worry an 
              over priced item will not sell.</p>
            <p>When potters devise a multi-tiered pricing policy on a specific 
              line of pots they can possibly increase their profit margin while 
              not giving up a sale. For example, the potter can make a casserole 
              selling for $25.00 and another slightly modified casserole priced 
              at $35.00. In this way the potter can test the market for a higher 
              priced item while still giving the potential customer an opportunity 
              to buy a pot. It is frequently noted customers need an excuse to 
              buy and they need an excuse not to buy. By using an adaptable scale 
              pricing structure the customer is always left with an option to 
              buy the lower priced casserole.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/zamek/cooling_crack.jpg" alt="Cooling Crack" width="391" height="291"></p>
            <p>A deceptive characteristic of selling handmade pottery is the low 
              barrier to entry when starting a business. The costs of capital 
              equipment, supplies, and raw materials are small expenditures compared 
              to the time and labor involved in making the actual pots. Many potters 
              find at first they can easily sell their work to friends and relatives. 
              This selective group of &quot;customers&quot; is always very supportive 
              with words of encouragement, often placing orders for new pots. 
              At this stage potters often expand their potential market to craft 
              shows which can bring in added revenues; however, if the potter 
              has not carefully calculated his costs he could be working for a 
              few cents per hour. The potter also has to compete against other 
              potters who have mistakenly priced their pots too low. The next 
              stage of making pottery revolves around starting a small business 
              and not simply just turning out more pots. It is often at this higher 
              level of business activity that potters are unable to run a business. 
              Many pottery businesses, as with the majority of small businesses, 
              fail within a short period of time. A more insidious development 
              can occur when potters sell their pots over several years and suffer 
              incremental cost increases in the production. At the end of many 
              long months and years of manual labor (making pots) they find themselves 
              making less money each year. This situation can be intensified if 
              the potter is selling a greater quantity of pots that are not priced 
              accurately. Higher production costs at increased volume of sales 
              can equal lower net profits. A pottery business can slowly fail 
              when there is a low or negative profit margin on some items that 
              are sold in high volumes. </p>
            <p>Researching the business operations of other potters and a survey 
              of the potential market would be the first steps in starting a pottery 
              business. Learning from other people's mistakes is less expensive 
              than learning from your own mistakes. A business education can be 
              a major benefit when starting any small business enterprise. Many 
              community colleges offer business courses in advertising, bookkeeping, 
              and marketing. The potter should take advantage of any educational 
              opportunities and apply the concepts and skills before starting 
              their own pottery business. While business skills will not directly 
              translate into making better pots, they will increase the chances 
              of the potter remaining in business so better pots can be made.</p>
