              was an experimental Russian art style in the first half of the 20th 
              C, in many ways connected to the Russian Revolution. It bears a 
              relationship to other international styles of the time, notably 
              Cubism, Futurism and Constructivism. It was an abstract art form 
              based on geometric figures, centered largely around the painter 
              Kasimir Malevich, whose famous first Suprematist work of 1913 was 
              <i>Black Square on white Background</i>. To Malevich, this was &quot;no 
              empty square, but rather the experience of non-objectivity... the 
              supremacy of pure feeling...&quot;</p>
            <p><img src="../images/suetin_design.jpg" alt="Suetin - Design for a Mug,, 1922" width="93" height="93" align="left">In 
              a similar way to the workings of the <a href="030501.html"><b>Bauhaus</b></a>
              in Germany, Suprematism sought to be an art movement that would 
              permeate everyday Russian life. Thus Suprematist works included 
              architecture, textiles, furniture, book design and ceramics. They 
              influenced Soviet architecture and design for many years to come. 
              From Suprematism arose the call for a synthesis between art and 
              daily life - this was referred to as 'Production Art'.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/leporskaya.jpg" alt="Leporskaya - Leningrad Set, 1961" width="150" height="104" align="left">UNOVIS 
              (Champions of the New Arts) was a group of artists surrounding Malevich 
              that became a new kind of art school. It would have played a similar 
              role in the Soviet Union as the <a href="030501.html"><b>Bauhaus</b></a>
              did in Germany. One of UNOVIS' objectives was the creation of objects 
              for practical use, hence the concern with applying Suprematism's 
              principles of volume construction and spatial geometry to functional 
              ceramic objects. Ceramics were seen not as isolated objects of beauty, 
              but rather integral elements of an aesthetically designed 'whole' 
              environment, based on Suprematist volume construction. A few Suprematist 
              ceramic works were made by Malevich himself, more then by his students 
              and followers Nikolei Suetin, Anna Leporskaya and Ilya Chashnik.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../images/suetin_set.jpg" alt="Suetin - Suprematist Set, 1923" width="138" height="103" align="left">Soon 
              after the October Revolution, Malevich, Suetin and Chashnik began 
              working at the Leningrad China Factory, formerly the Imperial Factory, 
              which had supplied the Tsarist Court and the deposed Russian upper 
              classes with fine china. The factory soon became a center of Russian 
              experimental ceramics, with such luminaries as Tatlin and Kandinsky 
              passing through. The factory initially produced 'Agit China', i.e. 
              ceramics in the service of Soviet revolutionary propaganda. In the 
              early 1920's, the Suprematists went on to establish a style of ceramics 
              based on their spatial concepts for decorative art.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/malevich.jpg" alt="Cubo-suprematist teapot , Malevich, 1923" width="100" height="91" align="left">Malevich 
              designed a few cups and teapots himself, but was mainly a catalyst 
              for his students, demonstrating the possibility of applying Suprematist 
              principles to ceramics, e.g. in his cubo-suprematist teapot of 1923 
              (pictured left).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><img src="../images/suetin.jpg" alt="Suetin - Set" width="75" height="113" align="left">In 
              contrast to Malevich's visionary, but perhaps not so functional 
              teapot, Nikolei Suetin went in the direction of using ceramic surfaces 
              as a canvas to apply geometric Suprematist decorative effects. This 
              also had a practical reason, as the young Soviet Union had little 
              resources and it was easier to use established molds and machinery 
              from the existing Imperial Factory. These were used as late as the 
              1930's. Using the old forms, Suetin achieved remarkable effects, 
              applying geometric fields to the surfaces. &quot;The decorative 
              patterns of Suetin and Chashnik transformed them into a kind of 
              materialized china space, in which Suprematist themes soared and 
              swam&quot;*. In contrast to traditional coffee sets etc., Suetin's 
              were based on a recurring theme, i.e. each piece in a set had a 
              similar decorative pattern, but with variations. </p>
            <p><img src="../images/mystery/mystery5.jpg" width="190" height="143" hspace="4" align="left">The 
              introduction of Suprematist spatial concepts into Soviet China also 
              had social implications. In contrast to the ornamented Tsarist decorative 
              style, Suetin's and Chashnik's designs were more formal and austere, 
              reflecting the general trend in emerging Soviet society to reject 
              anything that might be associated with the opulence and ostentatiousness 
              associated with that class.</p>
            <p>Although Suprematism has been relegated to the history books, it's 
              influence on Soviet and contemporary Russian art and ceramics should 
              not be under estimated - Suprematist works are still capable of 
              firing the imagination today.</p>
