              Portraits, depicting part of the human body are complicated and 
              difficult to execute. Certain skills are needed first. The workshop 
              begins with the participants drawing simple geometric forms or making 
              plaster models. This is followed by charcoal or pastel drawings 
              made in about a half hour that give the first impression of the 
              human form, not unlike a snapshot, but reflecting the artist&#8217;s 
              subjective viewpoint. <br>

              With a live model, this workshop will focus on 'Way's of seeing', 
              and will consist of doing a series of exercises which simplify seeing 
              and drawing. They give experiences of different possibilities of 
              interpreting or using the figure. These ways of seeing can then 
              be applied to drawing and painting from any subject, and can lead 
              to abstraction. Josie encourages participants to realize their own 
              unique vision, and develop their individual strengths. The workshop 
              is suitable for all levels including beginners<br>
