              The legend of the ten lost tribes of ancient Israelites has caught 
              the imagination of writers and poets during the centuries, finding 
              them was the quest of many. It came partly true when, during the 
              last century, small communities of Jewish people that called themselves 
              <a href="http://www.africana.com/research/encarta/tt_176.asp"> <b>Beita 
              Israel</b></a> (The House of Israel) were discovered in Ethiopia. 
              It is believed that their unique identity was preserved because 
              they lead a tightly knitted social life in secluded areas, tenaciously 
              clinging to the Jewish religion and to the dream of being redeemed 
              in the Holy Land. This was accomplished with the establishment of 
              the state of Israel and their miraculous emigration to Israel in 
              the early eighties. 
            <p>The story of their settlement and integration into the life of 
              the modern state of Israel, which is still taking its course, is 
              a complex of success and failure; the story of the ceramic artists 
              from this ethnic group seems to be different. 
            <p><img src="images/ethiopian1b.jpg" alt="Ethiopian pottery" width="309" height="224" align="left">Traditionally, 
              pottery in Ethiopia, linked to crafts in general, was among the 
              less honorable occupations. It may have had to do with a rigid social 
              structure or, as anthropologists suggest, it may be linked to magic 
              and the secret of fire; those who know are feared and kept at a 
              distance. Never the less, the necessity for household utensils for 
              daily use in the past centuries, made pottery common among men and 
              women. Alongside, flourished other sculptural and decorative clay 
              work. </p>
            <p>Among the Ethiopian immigrants that came from Gundar area and other 
              central locations, were a few ceramic artists who had already studied 
              and worked in Ethiopia. Thenat Awaqa, Eli Aman, Mulu Geta, Menachem 
              Dincau and a few others, are in recent years, capturing the attention 
              of the public with interesting work. They live in different parts 
              of Israel, with no or little knowledge of each other, yet their 
              work shows admirable consistency. Not only does it share distinct 
              common stylistic features, that are characteristic also of works 
              done in Ethiopian community centers in Israel, but an emotional 
              affinity prevails over all. </p>
            <p>The figurative aspect and the narrative themes are the most striking 
              traits of the Ethiopian sculptural work done so far. Small figurines, 
              measuring about fifteen to twenty cm., are the most common and popular 
              sculptures. These were produced in Ethiopia, along functional ware, 
              for sale in the market place to tourists; they continue to attract 
              attention of this slice of the market till today in Israel.</p>
            <p> <img src="images/ethiopian2.jpg" alt="Ethiopian pottery" width="217" height="232" align="left">The 
              figurines are based on a cylindrical body upon which a large head 
              is resting. Arms, pipelike, are attached to the body terminating 
              in incised fingers. Legs and feet are usually not outlined in the 
              more simplified versions, since the body is covered in a long gown. 
              Legs, again pipelike, when present, are placed with feet flat on 
              the ground in a rigid position. Female and male figures are depicted, 
              differentiation centers on the head and upper part of the body, 
              i.e., females have large breasts, men have beards. All artists work 
              with a low firing clay, unglazed but burnished with simple natural 
              tools. </p>
            <p>In Thenat Awaqa&#8217;s work females have large heads due to the 
              high coiffeur covered with a handkerchief appropriate to Jewish 
              married women. Faces are elongated with quite large holes for eyes. 
              Men have beards and are bareheaded, their hair presented by incised 
              lines. There is little attention to anatomical precision, body and 
              features are simplified, some are expressively exaggerated. Incised 
              lines create a linear decoration to enhance the planar surface.</p>
            <p> <img src="images/ethiopian3.jpg" alt="Ethiopian pottery" width="242" height="317" align="left">Thenat 
              Awaqa, a 34 years old mother of four daughters, lives in Israel 
              since 1991. She comes from a family of potters in the Gundar area, 
              she trained in Adis-Abeba where she received a diploma in ceramics. 
              At present she is working at home, hand building and also working 
              on the wheel &#8220;I like to sculpt my dreams&#8221; she points 
              out in an interview, and this innocent remark gives deep insight 
              into her spiritual and creative world.<br>
              Thenat, and all the other artists who live now in Israel, continue 
              to work in the tradition they were trained and practiced in the 
              past. The works of Thenat, Eli, Mulu, Menachem Dincau and a few 
              others, although exhibiting individual qualities, are deeply rooted 
              in the art and culture of African tribal art with emphasis on the 
              domestic and mundane. The folklore of the native Ethiopian village 
              is recreated in their art, in an innocuous and a somewhat idealized 
              way. The women are engaged in household chores; carrying water, 
              preparing food and tending their children. Men are doing the more 
              strenuous work of gathering wood or pounding wheat. Families are 
              gathered around the table eating their meals.</p>
            <p> Eli Aman who emigrated to Israel in 1984 completed his craft education 
              in Israel, he is forty one years old. He already took part in group 
              exhibitions, had several one man shows and his work is shown at 
              private galleries. Eli&#8217;s figures are more sophisticated, some 
              are larger reaching up to fifty cm., although this is a technical 
              limitation due to the size of his kiln. He concentrates on the male 
              figure which is depicted in a dignified way becoming the elders 
              of the village, monks and teachers. The figures are more varied 
              and the modeling more plastic, both body and dress show a pronounced 
              three dimensional presence. The same goes for Menachem Dinkau who 
              made some very interesting figures of musicians, pregnant women 
              and a group compositions of a preacher addressing his flock. </p>
            <p><img src="images/ethiopian4.jpg" alt="Ethiopian pottery" width="172" height="255" align="left">Mulu 
              Geta (b.1949) studied pottery in Adis-Abeba and also in Israel, 
              he too is a known figure among the Ethiopian artists. His style 
              is much more personal, realism and fantasy figure side by side with 
              a dash of humor. Some of his sculptures deal with the same topics 
              such as parenthood, but his artistic imagination is given a freer 
              hand, as in the two small (about 20 cm. high) works titled Family1 
              and Family2. By joining two almost complete spheres Mulu succeeded, 
              in these sculptures, to build an expressive human figure despite 
              its anatomical incongruity, which is also very rewarding, from a 
              modern, sculptural, point of view. Arms and legs that follow the 
              abstract decorative pattern on the body are in harmony with the 
              whole composition. His sense of humor comes out again in the Musician, 
              a group seated on a grinning frog, or in the Seated Man, a typical 
              figure of his repertoire but dressed in a western suit and wearing 
              a ridiculous pair of glasses.</p>
            <p> The high quality of Mulu&#8217;s art is again expressed in the 
              complicated composition of the Mourning piece. It comprises a group 
              of people mourning an outstretched dead body on the village background. 
              In a very tight space he cramped together people and huts with a 
              multitude of essential details, that created a claustrophobic and 
              somewhat surreal ambiance befitting the grief experienced. The theme 
              of death preoccupied Mulu for a long time after his arrival in Israel 
              being a direct response to the hardship and death that befall the 
              Ethiopian community during its exodus. </p>
            <p><img src="images/ethiopian5.jpg" alt="Ethiopian pottery" width="251" height="420" align="left">Although 
              living in Israel for almost two decade during which the artists, 
              as well as their community at large, came in contact with the local 
              people, they have somehow remained outsiders. Because of a huge 
              gap between the Ethiopian way of life in the past, and that found 
              in modern Israel, a gap which comprises religious, social, economic 
              and cultural differences, they live in a permanent dilemma. Modern 
              society exerts a continuous pressure towards assimilation in the 
              new, strange but alluring culture of the present, a pressure that 
              clashes with the innate wish to cling to their old traditional way 
              of life. This conflicting existence pervades their life in general, 
              and it is striking in their art. They all, as Thenat pointed out, 
              work from memories which draw upon the same source - the familiar, 
              beloved, but lost way of life. <br>
              <br>
              Some inevitable questions arise; for how long can these artists 
              nourish on memories that tend to fade in time? What will happen 
              to the distinctive traits of their art that have sprung from a culture 
              that is not theirs anymore? Will the strong western bearings of 
              Israel&#8217;s modern and sometime abstract art obliterate their 
              unique innocent vision of the world or their realistic tendencies? 
              Will they be able, in the future, to sustain the spirit and humanism 
              of their past work? </p>
            <p>Their art, as of present, is certainly in danger. The better artists, 
              no doubt, will find their own mode of expression, although the outcome 
              is difficult to predict. Others may continue to produce the same 
              figurines or bird adorned bowls in a commercialized vein, for which 
              stagnation already looms. In any case, it seems, the story of the 
              art of the Ethiopian artists in Israel, is inevitably going to change 
              in the future. The work done in the recent past should therefore 
              be much more appreciated and preserved. </p>
