Substitutions for Raw Ceramic Materials</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/e_gills.gif" ALT="E"  ALIGN=LEFT>douard Bastarache's 
  book <I><b><a href="http://www.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/~edouardb/">Substitutions 
  for Raw Ceramic Materials</a></b></I> is a 'tour de force' of substitutions 
  of particular ceramic materials with others. The book is the result of a research 
  project undertaken between 1993 and 1995 before computer glazing programs became 
  widely available and is targeted to those ceramic artists and potters who don't 
  have computer access to help them with otherwise complex calculations in materials 
  substitutions. 
<P>This is a comprehensive publication on glaze materials substitutions
and includes 10 chapters filled with glaze recipes using the sustitution
method. Both the original and substituted recipes are provided. Materials
substituted include Spodumene, Petalite, Lepidolite, Potash Feldspars,
Cornish Stone, Kona F-4 spar, Plastic Vitrox, Volcanic Ash, Dolomite, Wollastonite,
Pryophyllite and Talc. Three hundred pages contain several hundred glazes.
In a typical glaze materials substitution, Custer Feldspar might be substituted
by Nephelene Syenite and Silica, or Spodumene by Lithium Carbonate, Silica
and Kaolin, etc.

lives in Quebec, Canada, and has a colorful history. He studied surgery,
internal medicine and neuroendecrine physiology and has been a consultant
in occupational and environmental medicine for 15 years. At the same time
as his medical studies, he studied ceramics under Julien Cloutier at La
Boutique d'Argile (The Clay Shop) and later also taught at the same school.
Bastarache now lives in the Sorel-Tracey region of Quebec, near the St.
Lawrence river. He uses waste materials from steel plants located in the
area to color many of his <B><A HREF="http://www.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/~edouardb/">glazes</A></B>
and clays. He fires most of his work to cone 9 1/2 in reduction in a 60
cubic foot downdraft gas kiln.

<P>His book <I>Substitutions for Raw Ceramic Materials</I> is the result of a 
  total of 30 years dabbling in ceramics and a 3 year research project. It is 
  currently available directly from <B><A HREF="mailto:edouardb@sorel-tracy.qc.ca">Edouard</A></B>.
