<p> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/a_gills.gif" alt="A" width="52" height="54">nnouncing the <i>People's Choice Best Ceramics Web Site Award</i>. Win a yearly 
  subscription to <a href="http://www.ceramicart.com.au"><b>Ceramics Art &amp; 
  Perception</b></a> or <a href="http://www.ceramicart.com.au/technical.html"><b>Ceramics
  Technical</b></a> by taking part!
<P>We all know that there are web sites - and there are web sites. Calling on 
  the spirit of good competition - and promoting good design in online ceramics, 
  your Ceramics Today Guide to ceramics has created this new award for best ceramics 
  web site. We are not looking for the best ceramic work, but rather the best 
  design representing that work online. The competition is open to all web sites 
  listed on Ceramics Today, such as individual potters, potteries and ceramic 
  societies, commercial sites, galleries and educational institutions. In fact 
  any of the categories listed on the Ceramics Today <b>main page</b> will 
  qualify. 
<P>What are the criteria for good web design? Here are some:
<ul>
  <li>user friendliness (easy navigation)</li>
  <li>good design concept</li>
  <li>good graphics</li>
  <li>fast loading</li>
  <li>informative</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you may apply other criteria, or one of the above may outweigh the 
  other, e.g. if you like the design so much it overrides difficulties in navigation.</p>
<P>Following five categories that will be judged and awarded a gold, silver and 
  bronze 'medal', according to the number of votes received: 
<ul>
  <li>individual artists or artists potteries</li>
  <li>ceramic society or educational institution</li>
  <li>commercial site</li>
  <li>gallery or museum</li>
  <li>miscellaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>The only condition is that the site be listed on Ceramics Today,or be 
  submitted to be listed on the database.</p>
<p>Voting has ended. Please keep your eyes on the main page for the winners to 
  be announced soon! </p>
