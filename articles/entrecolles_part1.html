              Part 1 
            <p>From William Burton's <i>Porcelain, It's Art and Manufacture</i>, 
              B.T. Batsford, London, 1906. The first letter was addressed to Pere 
              Orry, procurer of the Chinese and Indian missions, and is dated 
              from Jao-chou - the capital of the district - September 1, 1712. 
            <p align="center">THE LETTERS OF P&Egrave;RE D'ENTRECOLLES 
            <p> From time to time I have stayed in Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n to 
              administer to the spiritual necessities of my converts, and so I 
              have interested myself in the manufacture of this beautiful porcelain, 
              which is so highly prized, and is sent to all parts of the world. 
              Nothing but my curiosity could ever have prompted me to such researches, 
              but it appears to me that a minute description of all that concerns 
              this kind of work might, somehow, be useful in Europe. 
            <p> Besides what I myself have seen, I have learnt a great many particulars 
              from my neophytes, several of whom work in porcelain, while others 
              do a great trade in it. I also confirmed the truth of the information 
              they had given me by a study of the Chinese books on the subject, 
              so that I believe I have obtained a pretty exact knowledge of all 
              that concerns this beautiful art, so that I can talk about it with 
              some confidence. Among these books I examined the history of Fou-liang, 
              and I have read carefully, in the fourth volume, the article on 
              porcelain. 
            <p> It says in these annals that formerly the porcelain was of exquisite 
              whiteness and free from fault, so that when the pieces were transported 
              into other countries, they were known only as the precious jewels 
              of Jao-chou. Further on, it says the beautiful porcelain which is 
              of such vivid whiteness or of a beautiful celestial blue, all comes 
              from Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n; there is some made in other places, 
              but it is quite different in colour as well as in finish. 
            <p> Without mentioning examples of the pottery that are made all over 
              China, but which are not called porcelain, there are some provinces 
              such as Fuchien and Canton where porcelain is made, but foreigners 
              can make no mistake for the porcelain of Fuchien is white like snow 
              without sheen, and it is not decorated with colours. Some workmen 
              of Ching-to-chen formerly transported themselves and their materials 
              there, hoping to make considerable profit by reason of the great 
              European commerce at Amoy; but this scheme came to naught, as they 
              were not successful in their manufacture. 
            <p> <img src="images/beaker_vase.gif" alt="Beaker Vase" width="140" height="275" align="left">The 
              reigning Emperor, who neglects nothing, had porcelain workers sent 
              from Ching-to-chen to Peking, together with everything proper for 
              this kind of work; nothing was omitted that would have enabled the 
              work done under his eyes to succeed, but it is stated that this 
              also ended in failure. It may be that political or other interests 
              had something to do with this want of success, but, however that 
              may be, Ching-to-chen alone has the honour of sending porcelain 
              to all parts of the world, even the Japanese buy from there. 
            <p> [Then follows an account of the situation and appearance of Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n-its 
              population and government which may be omitted here.] 
            <p> After these few particulars of the situation and present conditions 
              of Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n, let us come to the porcelain in which 
              its whole wealth consists. Let me state all that I know as to the 
              materials used in its composition and their preparation; as to the 
              kinds of porcelains and the way to make them; as to the oil<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
              that gives them their brightness and their several qualities; as 
              to the colours which are their ornaments, and the art of applying 
              them; as to the firing and the precautions that are taken to give 
              the suitable degree of heat: finally, I will conclude by making 
              some reflections on the old and modern porcelains, and on certain 
              shapes or designs which the Chinese find it impracticable to manufacture. 
              These things that the Chinese cannot do might, perhaps, be easily 
              done in Europe if one could find there the same materials.<br>
              The material of porcelain is composed of two kinds of clay, one 
              called Pe-tun-tse <font size="-1">(ed. note: feldspathic rock)</font> 
              and the other Kao-lin. The latter is disseminated with corpuscles, 
              which have some shimmer<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, the former 
              is simply white and very fine to the touch. While a large number 
              of big boats come up the river from Jao-chou to Ching-to-chen to 
              be loaded with porcelain, nearly as many small ones come down from 
              Ki-mctn laden with Pe-tun-tse and Kao-lin made up into bricks, for 
              Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n does not produce any of the materials 
              suitable for porcelain. Pe-tun-tse, which is so fine in grain, is 
              simply pulverized rock taken from quarries, and then shaped into 
              bricks. Every kind of stone is not suitable, or it would not be 
              necessary to go for it, twenty or thirty miles away, into the next 
              province. The good stone, the Chinese say, must have a slight tinge 
              of green. The pieces of stone are first broken with iron hammers, 
              and the fragments are reduced to a very fine powder in mortars by 
              means of certain levers, which have a stone head shod with iron. 
              These levers are worked incessantly, either by men or by water-power, 
              in the same way as the tilt-hammers in paper-mills. The powder is 
              then put into a great vessel filled with water, and stirred vigorously 
              with an iron shovel. When it has been allowed to stand several minutes, 
              a kind of cream forms at the top four or five fingers thick; this 
              they take off and put into another vessel full of water. The mixture 
              in the first vessel is stirred up several times, and each time they 
              remove the scum that gathers on the top, until nothing is left but 
              the larger particles, the weight of which makes them sink to the 
              bottom; these are finally taken out and again pounded. With regard 
              to the second vessel into which they put all that has been skimmed 
              out of the first, they wait until a kind of paste has formed at 
              the bottom, and when the water above it seems very clear it is poured 
              off so as not to disturb the sediment. This paste is then thrown 
              into moulds, which are a kind of large and wide wooden box, the 
              bottom of which is a bed of bricks with an even surface. Over this 
              brick bed a coarse cloth is stretched, up to the sides of the case; 
              this cloth is filled with the paste, and soon afterwards they cover 
              it with another cloth on the top of which they put a layer of bricks 
              laid evenly, one by the side of the other. This helps to squeeze 
              out the water more quickly without losing any of the porcelain material 
              which, as it hardens readily, takes the shape of the bricks<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. 
              Before it has become quite hard the paste is divided into little 
              bricks, which are sold by the hundred; this colour and the shape 
              have given it the name Pe-tun-tse. There would be nothing to add 
              to this preparation if the Chinese were not in the habit of adulterating 
              their merchandise; but people who roll little grains of paste in 
              pepper dust, and mix them with real peppercorns, are not likely 
              to sell Pe-tun-tse without mixing it with coarser materials, so 
              that it has to be purified afresh before it is used. 
            <p> Kao-lin requires a little less labor than Pe-tun-tse ; nature 
              has done the greater part. Mines of it are found in the heart of 
              certain mountains, which on the outside are covered with reddish 
              earth. These mines are fairly deep ; it is found there in masses, 
              and it is also made up into little squares in the same method as 
              described above for the Pe-tun-tse. I should be inclined to think 
              that the white clay of Malta, known as the clay of St. Paul, approaches 
              in its nature to the kao-lin I am speaking of, although one cannot 
              perceive in it the small silvery particles with which the kao-lin 
              is sown. Fine porcelain owes its strength to the kao-lin; it is 
              only the mixture of a soft earth or a soft clay, which gives strength 
              to the Pe-tun-tse obtained from the hardest rocks. 
            <p> A rich merchant told me that the English or Dutch (the Chinese 
              use the same name for both nations) bought, several years ago, some 
              Pe-tun-tse, which they took to their own country to make porcelain 
              with, but, having taken no kao-lin, their undertaking failed, as 
              they afterwards owned. The Chinese merchant said to me, laughing, 
              &quot; They wanted to have a body without bones to support its flesh.&quot;<br>
              Besides the boats laden with Pe-tun-tse and Kao-lin with which the 
              riverbank at Ching-to-chen is lined, others are filled with a whitish 
              liquid substance. I have long known that this substance is the oil<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
              that gives porcelain its whiteness and its sheen, but I did not 
              know its composition, which I have since learnt. It seems to me 
              that the Chinese name &quot; Yeou &quot; which they apply to different 
              kinds of oil suits the liquid I am speaking of less than the word 
              &quot; Tsi,&quot; which means glaze, and I should think that people 
              would call it by that name in Europe. This oil or glaze is extracted 
              from the hardest stone; which is not surprising, as it is said that 
              stones are chiefly formed out of the salts and oils of the earth, 
              which mix and closely unite together. Although the same kind of 
              stone from which Pe-tun-tse is prepared may also be used for the 
              preparation of this glaze, they generally select the whitest pieces 
              and those, which have the greenest spots. 
            <p> The history of Fou-liang, though it does not enter into details, 
              says that the best stone for the glaze is that which has spots similar 
              in colour to the cypress leaf<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>, or with 
              reddish marks on a brownish ground something like toadflax. The 
              rock is first well washed, and then prepared in the same way as 
              Pe-tun-tse; when the purest stuff has all been collected out of 
              the first vessel into the second one they add to about every hundred 
              pounds of the cream one pound of a stone or mineral like alum, named 
              Shih-kao<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. $ This has to be first roasted 
              in a fire and then pounded; it acts like rennet in coagulating the 
              material, though care is taken to keep it liquid. This stone glaze 
              is never used alone, but another is mixed with it which acts like 
              its essence. The composition of this is as follows : They take big 
              pieces of quicklime, on to which a little water is thrown by hand 
              to reduce them to powder; a bed of dried bracken is spread upon 
              this and then another layer of slaked lime, and so on alternately 
              ; then the ferns are set on fire. When all is consumed the ashes 
              are spread upon new beds of dried bracken. This is repeated five 
              or six times running; it can be done still oftener, and the glaze 
              is all the better for it. Formerly, so it says in the history of 
              Fou-liang, they used besides the bracken the wood of the tree Se-tse. 
              I should think by the tartness of this fruit when it is not ripe, 
              and by its little crowning husk, that it is a kind of medlar. My 
              converts tell me that this wood is no longer used, seemingly because 
              it has become very scarce in this district. It was perhaps owing 
              to this wood that the porcelain made in early times is more beautiful 
              than that which is made nowadays. The nature of the lime and the 
              bracken .contribute also to the quality of the glaze, and I have 
              noticed that that which comes from certain places is much more esteemed 
              than that which comes from elsewhere. When they have obtained a 
              certain quantity of the ashes of lime and bracken, they are thrown 
              into vessels full of water. In one hundred pounds they dissolve 
              a pound of Shih-kao (see above). The mixture is stirred up and then 
              left to stand until there appears on the surface a scum or crust, 
              which is skimmed off and thrown into a second vessel, and so on 
              several times. When a kind of paste has collected at the bottom 
              of the second vessel they decant the water, and the liquid sediment 
              is used as the second oil to be mixed with the previous one. For 
              a proper mixture it is necessary that the two purees are equally 
              thick ; to ensure this they dip into each little squares of Pe-tun-tse, 
              which they dip in several times, and then take out to judge if the 
              thickness of the deposit is the same with both. 
            <p> <img src="images/kakiemon_vase.gif" alt="Kakiemon Vase" width="144" height="220" align="left">The 
              best glazes are made from a mixture of ten parts of the stone glaze 
              with one part of the glaze of lime and fern ashes, and the most 
              economical never put less than three parts. The merchants who sell 
              the glaze, however little inclined they are to cheat, do not think 
              much of increasing its volume; they put water to the glaze, and, 
              to disguise their fraud, they add Shih-kao in proportion to thicken 
              the liquid.<br>
              Before I explain the way in which this glaze is used it will be 
              better to describe how the porcelain is made. In the less frequented 
              districts of Ching-to-chen are vast sheds surrounded by walls, where 
              one sees ranged, stage upon stage; a great number of jars of earth. 
              Within these walls live and work an infinite number of workpeople, 
              who each have their allotted task, and a piece of porcelain, before 
              it is ready to go into the oven, passes through the hands of twenty 
              persons, and that without any confusion. Doubtless they have proved 
              that the work is done much more quickly in this way. The first task 
              consists in purifying again the Pe-tun-tse and the Kao-lin from 
              the waste added to it when it was sold, which is performed by the 
              same washing and settling as before described. It is not necessary 
              to break up the pieces of Kao-lin; these are simply put into a very 
              open basket, which is placed in a vessel filled with water, where 
              the Kao-lin easily liquefies of itself, though there is generally 
              a residue left which must be thrown away. By the end of a year this 
              waste accumulates, and forms big masses of a white spongy sand, 
              which the workmen must clear out from their workshops. 
            <p> When the two materials have been prepared in this way they must 
              be mixed in their proper proportions. For the fine porcelains they 
              put as much Kao-lin as Pe-tun-tse; for the inferior ones they use 
              four parts of Kao-lin and six parts of Pe-tun-tse; while the least 
              that they use is one part of Kao-lin and three of Pe-tun-tse. 
            <p> The mixture is thrown into a big pit well paved and cemented, 
              where it is trodden and kneaded until it becomes stiff ; this is 
              very laborious work; those Christians who are employed at it find 
              it difficult to attend church; they are only allowed to go if they 
              can find substitutes, because as soon as this work is interrupted 
              all the other workmen are stopped. 
            <p> From the mass thus prepared, lumps are taken and spread on large 
              slates. The workmen knead, beat, and roll them thoroughly, taking 
              care that no hollows are left inside the mass and that no foreign 
              bodies get into it. A hair, a grain of sand would spoil the whole 
              work. If this mass is badly worked the porcelain cracks, splits, 
              drops or bends. From these prime materials such beautiful works 
              of porcelain are produced, some by shaping on the wheel, others 
              only in moulds ; and they are afterwards finished with a knife. 
              All the plain pieces are made in the first way. A cup, for example, 
              when it leaves the wheel, is very roughly shaped, almost like the 
              top of a hat before it has been blocked. The first workman only 
              gives it the required diameter and height, and it leaves his hands 
              almost as soon as it is commenced, for he receives only three deniers 
              per board, and on each board are twenty-six pieces. The foot of 
              the cup is then nothing but a piece of clay of the necessary width, 
              and it is only hollowed out with a knife when . the other operations 
              are finished, and when the cup is dry and firm enough. When the 
              cup leaves the wheel it is taken by a second workman, who puts it 
              straight upon its base. Shortly afterwards it is handed over to 
              a third man, who puts it on its mould and gives it its shape; this 
              mould is mounted on a kind of wheel. A fourth workman trims and 
              polishes the cup, especially the rims, with a knife, and pares it 
              down as much as necessary for its transparency; he scrapes it several 
              times and moistens each time, however little he may have pared it, 
              if it is too dry, for fear he should break it. In taking the cup 
              from the mould they turn it softly on the same mould without pressing 
              it more on one side than the other, otherwise it would develop cavities 
              in the clay or it would go out of shape. It is surprising to see 
              the rapidity with which these vessels pass through so many different 
              hands ; and I am told that a piece of fired porcelain has passed 
              through the hands of seventy workmen. I can easily believe this 
              by what I have myself seen, for these great workshops have been 
              for me a kind of Areopagus, where I have preached Him who fashioned 
              the first man out of clay, and from whose hands we depart to become 
              vessels of honour or of shame. 
            <p> The large objects of porcelain are made in two pieces; one half 
              is lifted on the wheel by three or four men, who support it on each 
              side while it is being shaped; the other half, which is almost dry, 
              is put on to it, and they join the two together with the same porcelain 
              materials diluted with water, which serves as a sort of mortar or 
              glue. When these pieces, so glued, are quite dry the seam or join 
              is polished inside and outside with a tool, so that, with the help 
              of the glaze, no inequality is left. In this way, too<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>, 
              they put handles, ears, and other pieces on to vases. This relates 
              chiefly to the pieces that are made in moulds or by hand, such as 
              fluted pieces, or those of bizarre shape; animals, grotesques, idols, 
              the busts ordered by Europeans, and such-like things. This kind 
              of moulded piece is made in three or four parts, which are joined 
              together and finished by the use of tools, by which means they are 
              polished, carved, or hollowed and perfected in details that the 
              mould does not give. As for flowers and other ornaments, which are 
              not in relief, but in intaglio, they are impressed in the porcelain 
              by seals or stamps; reliefs, ready prepared, are also applied in 
              the same way, almost as gold lace is put on a coat. 
            <p> I have recently learnt something concerning these moulds. When 
              they obtain a model of any required piece of porcelain, which is 
              such that it cannot be made by hand on the wheel, they impress on 
              the model some moulding-clay, and when this has been properly impressed 
              it is cut up into pieces of pretty large size, which are left to 
              stiffen. When the moulds are to be used the sections are put in 
              front of the fire, after which they are coated with the porcelain 
              material according to the thickness required. They press this coating 
              firmly by hand, and then the mould with the coating is put for a 
              moment in front of the fire, to detach the clay press from the mould. 
              The various sections of the whole piece, after being separately 
              moulded, are joined together with a thick slip of the porcelain 
              materials. I have seen animal figures of large size made in this 
              way, and after they had left the substance to get hard it was shaped 
              and finished with a tool and the separate parts were then united 
              together. Afterwards pieces are glazed and fired. If it is desired 
              to have a decoration of different colours this is afterwards painted 
              and the gold is applied, and then it is fired a second time. This 
              kind of porcelain, which is made with great care, is of course very 
              dear... 
            <p> [Then follows a paragraph relating to the kind of clay from which 
              the moulds are made, and to the advantage a merchant has in the 
              rapidity with which he can execute European orders if he possesses 
              a good stock of moulds, so that he can employ many gangs of workmen 
              at the same time.]
