              article by Reid Harvey 
            <p> <img align=left src="../images/safari4.jpg" width="135" height="220" hspace="8"><i>Left: 
              The Hoffman kiln at Khorobhagarat, Sudan. Because this kiln fires 
              heavy fuel oil, the wood previously burned in the clamp kilns of 
              this arid region will be conserved. </i> 
            <p> This project proposal has been endorsed by the Khartoum office 
              of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), 
              and is waiting approval by UNIDO headquarters in Austria. On a widespread, 
              international scale, UNIDO has been the only organization to support 
              ceramic industrial projects. However, several Non-Government Organizations 
              (NGOs) such as the German development group, GTZ, and the British 
              based Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), have also 
              been active. These groups have executed several successful ceramic-related 
              projects, primarily in the production of building materials. When 
              the BRRI's newly designed vertical tunnel brick kiln begins functioning, 
              it may well be the first of its kind on the African continent. It 
              may also be the first anywhere to fire carbonized agricultural waste. 
              In Asia, these kilns fire bituminous coal fines. Adapting to carbonized 
              agri-waste offers a design that is appropriate and more sustainable 
              in Africa. 
            <p> <img align=right src="../images/safari1.jpg" width="184" height="280" hspace="8"><i>Right: 
              Sectional view of the vertical tunnel kiln.</i> 
            <p>The best I was able to do in the Sudan, besides adapting the vertical 
              tunnel kiln, was to document what ceramists there are doing and 
              the ways in which their products are essential in the everyday lives 
              of the Sudanese. Ceramic ziers (water containers) are universally 
              used to store water. Ziers are scattered around towns just like 
              public drinking fountains, so necessary in the burning, dry climate. 
              There is a generous custom in the Sudan, in which civic-minded individuals 
              will donate and maintain ziers for the community and for any passersby. 
              Low fire ceramics range from ziers to cooking pots as well as drums 
              made by stretching animal skins over a ceramic base. In the absence 
              of other entertainment, my family would often spend an evening drumming, 
              pretending our rhythm and ceremony were as sophisticated as that 
              of the Sudanese. In another custom, Sudanese drink coffee brewed 
              in the traditional low fire gebana. The gebana resembles a sphere 
              with a small cylindrical spout pointed 45 degrees out and upward. 
              As with the zier, the gebana has a rounded bottom and is sometimes 
              placed in the sand. But it normally rests in a cloth or beaded ring, 
              a match in design to the coffee pot's incised decoration. 
            <p> For the everyday ceramics of Sudan, whole communities are typically 
              given over to production. Ziers, for example, are made in Dajo, 
              near El Obeid, by women using a red clay with an addition of millet 
              husks and mica. Often the clay is plastic, sun-parched mud, skimmed 
              from the top of dried up water holes. Products including the gebana, 
              drums, cook pots, and ziers are fired on a bonfire by the men of 
              the community. From a scholar's perspective, Sudan is of interest 
              to both the ceramic artist and the scientist. In Khartoum, the Sudan 
              University Ceramic Department has offered a classical approach to 
              art instruction for 40 years. The graphic and three-dimensional 
              skills of the students are impressive. However, basic ceramic materials 
              are lacking; glazes are expensive and usually imported from Egypt. 
              Individual artists must have clay materials trucked in from several 
              hours away. And the public has not been adequately sensitized to 
              the high quality of local ceramic work produced, preferring instead 
              mass produced imported ware.
