              Approach<br>
              </font></strong></b>Article by Australian studio potter Leonard 
              Smith 
            <p>There are as many approaches to raw glaze as there are potters 
              and lately much has been written about the subject. This was not 
              the case when I was a student, in fact the information I received 
              was that the method was too difficult, needing special techniques; 
              and due to the requirement that raw glazes have large quantities 
              of clay in them, the glazes were very limited. However all those 
              beautiful Sung glazes I so admire are in fact once-fired and biscuit 
              firing is historically a very recent innovation. Glazing bisque 
              ware is mainly a European invention used to overcome the difficulties 
              of raw or once-fired tin glazes for majolica ware. Later it was 
              used during the industrial revolution when the pottery process was 
              divided into separate tasks requiring little or no skill. 
            <p align="center"><b>Why raw glaze?</b> </p>
            <p><img src="images/ferguson.jpg" width="196" height="179" align="left"><font size="-2">Raw 
              glazed bowl by <a href="ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a></font></p>
            <p>Raw glazing gives me that spontaneity I was seeking due to the 
              shorter time lapse between the pot's conception and its completion. 
              If desired, the pots can be thrown, trimmed and glazed in one day 
              although I prefer to throw pots in the afternoon, return in the 
              morning to turn and finish them, glaze them and then commence the 
              cycle again. This cycle breaks the monotony of throwing for eight 
              hours straight and gives my work day more variety. As I use brushwork 
              and glaze trailing for decoration I wait until a kiln load of pots 
              is dry and then I do all the decorating in one sitting. I find decorating 
              needs a real flow to develop and this is difficult in small sessions 
              on a daily basis. </p>
            <p align="center"><b>Technical Considerations</b> </p>
            <p><b>Clays</b> </p>
            <p>I have made my own clay bodies for several years based on the Gulgong 
              (NSW) clay, Cresta B.B. from A.C.A. minerals. Most clays which accept 
              slip with few problems will raw glaze at the leather hard stage. 
              In my experience clays that are difficult to raw glaze are difficult 
              to throw and fire, so perhaps if you are having problems the solution 
              is to use a new body. In general a base clay with good green strength, 
              a modulus of rupture above 7.0 mpa (75 kg/-2cm), and a moderate 
              shrinkage to bone dry- no more than 8% -i s a good choice for raw 
              glazing. The addition of a coarser grade of silica aids the ability 
              of a clay to withstand the shock of re-wetting. The clay goes from 
              hard leather hard (where the clay crystals are in contact with each 
              other) back to the plastic state and this causes swelling of the 
              pot wall. Lately I have been using 100 mesh silica and have found 
              this imparts more than enough tooth to the body and doesn't notably 
              change its firing characteristics. It still rings resonantly when 
              struck after firing and displays almost zero porosity. I have used 
              60 mesh silica and it is excellent but a little more expensive. 
              For a long time I added 65 mesh sand which was quite coarse compared 
              to 60 mesh silica. It was also excellent in that it gave a nicely 
              textured clay body but it needed a lot of grinding to make the base 
              and galleries of the pots smooth after firing.</p>

            <p>Notes 1. My current clay fires gray and is very fine. 2. Fine sand 
              helps it withstand the shock of rewetting. 3. A white porcelaineous 
              body is more difficult to glaze in some shapes. 4. White stoneware 
              for big pots and hand building. </p>
            <p><b>Glazes</b> </p>
            <p>If the glaze doesn't match the shrinkage of the body from the plastic 
              state one of two things will happen. If there is too much clay in 
              the glaze (an unusual occurrence), the surface will show cracks 
              like the surface of a clay pan and these usually lead to crawling 
              when fired. The solution to this is to calcine a portion of the 
              clay until the glaze fits. More usually the glaze will chip or flake 
              off the pot, particularly at edges of rims and handles. This indicates 
              that the glaze isn't plastic enough and needs more clay added to 
              it (it is surprising how much clay you can add and not have any 
              noticeable change in the glaze quality). Otherwise a more plastic 
              clay or bentonite may be substituted for some of the clay present 
              in the glaze batch. </p>
            <p>For my technique the necessary amount of clay is the equivalent 
              of bentonite has approximately six times the shrinkage of clay. 
              10% ball clay and 3% bentonite equals about 30% of ball clay. Bentonites 
              are volcanic clays which have the ability to absorb huge quantities 
              of water into their structure and hence shrink considerably on drying. 
              Not all bentonites shrink six times as much as clay but most come 
              somewhere near it. Western Australian bentonite, which is now hard 
              to obtain, has only three times the shrinkage and is less useful 
              in low clay glazes but because of the fluxes it has present, it 
              would be an excellent material to use in a glaze with say 20% clay. 
              At present Commercial Minerals (Australia) are supplying bentonites 
              from the Hunter Valley of NSW (not from USA as was the case). So 
              far the Hunter Valley ones seem fine to me. </p>
            <p>Bentonites are difficult to add to water. There are two approaches. 
              If you are mixing a batch of glaze, mix the bentonite in the dry 
              state with the other glaze materials, dispersing it evenly throughout, 
              then mix it with water in the normal way and pass the mix through 
              a 60 or 80 mesh sieve If you want to mix it into an existing glaze 
              slop, sprinkle it on top and leave it overnight, then stir the batch 
              with a paint stirrer in an electric drill and re- sieve before use 
            </p>
            <p>With the exception of some special glazes like iron blues, I have 
              been able to obtain most glaze qualities in the form of raw glazes.</p>

              <p>This glaze is a very unusual glaze with 30% silica and is an 
                excellent raw glaze. With 2% iron it is a good Celadon and with 
                10% iron a Teadust/ Tenmoku. It is very craze resistant and durable. 
                I originally developed it from the Calcium Alumina Silica Eutectic.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>N.B. Glazes are made up with sufficient water to give a liter weight 
              of between 1300 and 1400 gm per liter</p>
            <p><b>Design</b></p>
            <p>Not many articles talk about this aspect of raw glazing, but it 
              is probably the most important one for a high success rate with 
              the technique. Raw glazing demands consideration of the design and 
              structure of the pot. You must consider how you are going to hold 
              the pot when dipping it into the glaze bucket. Although big pots 
              can be sprayed this is not economical for production runs of pots. 
              To facilitate dipping most of my pots are either undercut or have 
              a substantial foot ring. A turned foot ring is ideal and one soon 
              learns the type which integrates with your pot designs and gives 
              enough grip to invert and dip into the glaze (remembering that the 
              clay is usually still flexible at this stage and after dipping softens 
              considerably and quickly).</p>

            <p> In diagram 1 type A is manageable, but B is a little difficult 
              to grasp, whilst C gives the best grip of all. Remember that the 
              foot ring must be thick enough to withstand the pressure necessary 
              to hold the pot upside down when dipping.

            <p>As a lot of my forms don't have a foot ring, I have found that 
              a bevel as in diagram 2 works well, allowing the pot to be dipped 
              to within 5 mm of the bevel. Remember that the diameter to be held 
              must fit comfortably into the hand Any pot over 100 mm on its base 
              is best held with two hands This may necessitate a different design 
              especially as these pots are likely to be much heavier and therefore 
              harder to hold. Wide flat forms are held between two hands on their 
              rims and the whole dipped in one operation. The rim is then touched 
              up with a brush when the glaze has dried. From a structural point 
              of view pots for raw glazing need to be thrown a little thicker 
              than normal. It is important to glaze in such a way that as little 
              stress as possible is caused to the pot. This normally means dipping 
              quickly Dipping one half and then the other is a sure way to split 
              the pot, particularly if it is fairly wide and flat.

            <p>Sharp corners, especially on the inside of pots, should be avoided 
              Casseroles are rounded inside even though from the outside they 
              appear sharply angled. Pots as in 3(a) will almost certainly crack 
              at the change of direction. They should be made as in diagram 3(b). 
            <p>I can't overemphasize the importance of even cross sections. Nearly 
              all my failures are a result of the cross sections of the pots being 
              uneven It may be that I turned a base thinner than the walls or 
              a section of the wall was thinner than that above it. If these pots 
              survive the initial rewetting they are sure to crack on drying. 
              Sometimes they can be repaired by brushing some thick glaze into 
              the cracks but this is not always a solution. The best solution 
              is to have pots with even sections </p>
            <p><b>Method</b></p>
            <p>Mugs, cream jugs and similar pots: I apply my handles after the 
              pots have been turned and whilst they are still soft leather hard, 
              i.e. cheese hard. I then allow the handles and the pots to equalize 
              in stiffness before glazing. One sure way to make handles collapse 
              is to glaze them before this equalization has occurred. Once the 
              handles and the pots show the barest sign of whiteness on their 
              edges, I glaze them I usually don't bother waxing feet or lid settings. 
              I pour glaze into the inside and then pour it out quickly whilst 
              turning the pot to completely cover the interior. Then I immediately 
              dip the pot down to my fingertips, give a little twist of the wrist, 
              pull the pot out, shake downwards sharply, turn it over and place 
              it back on the pot board. If the pot has a gallery, I run my finger 
              around the gallery to remove most of the glaze and then leave the 
              pots to first soften and then dry. The next day when the pots are 
              again leather hard, I sponge any runs off and sponge any galleries 
              and lids clean I have used this technique on articles from 450 mm 
              jugs to 30 mm tea strainers and I've never lost a handle or had 
              a pot split, providing it complied with the criteria of the design 
              section. </p>
            <p>Teapots: The greatest test of any raw glazer is teapots. After 
              assembling the pots I put them into the damp cupboard to equalize 
              the moisture content of the parts and their joins. Usually with 
              the next day's glazing I pull them out and allow them a couple of 
              hours in the open air and glaze them after everything else I again 
              pour glaze inside, about a cupful, and pour it out, starting on 
              one side of the spout and turning until the last bit of glaze pours 
              from the spout. I then blow down the spout to clear the strainer 
              holes and immediately dip the outside, giving a twist as I go. When 
              I drain out the pot I usually put one finger on the gallery for 
              extra support whilst I shake off the excess glaze. Again once the 
              pot is upright on the pot board I blow down the spout as hard as 
              I can to ensure the strainer holes are clear. I then wipe the gallery 
              with my finger to clear it of glaze and touch up when the pot has 
              returned to the leather hard state. </p>
            <p>Bowls, plates, lids etc: Usually if a bowl can be held by the foot 
              ring I use the same method as mugs etc. except that I like to glaze 
              the underneath of a foot ring. To do this I use a slip trailer with 
              a large orifice filled with glaze. I squeeze the glaze out into 
              the area contained by the foot ring till it is covered and then 
              simply suck up the excess. The inside and outside are then glazed 
              as above. </p>
            <p>When glazing objects that have nothing to hold on to, like lids 
              or plates, I first dip my hands in glaze, then pick up the piece 
              with both hands, immerse the lot in the glaze, letting go completely 
              for a fraction of a second, ensuring that any area the fingers touch 
              is covered in glaze, and catch it. I then remove it, give it a sharp 
              shake to drain off the excess glaze and place it on a pot board 
              for sponging the next day My pot boards are wooden and relatively 
              non porous and raw glaze is easy to remove from them with a sponge. 
            </p>
            <p>Any pots I anticipate difficulty with, I wax with either a paraffin 
              wax/kerosine mix or liquid wax emulsion. These pots usually need 
              touching up, but wait until the glaze is dry and use a mop type 
              brush to carefully build up the glaze. Raw glazes handle and fettle 
              very easily due to the clay imparting excellent strength to the 
              glaze surface. Another advantage of raw glaze is that it allows 
              me to pick up the pot without damaging its surface when I am decorating 
              with brushwork </p>
            <p><b>Firing and Firing Cycles</b></p>
            <p>Usually firing raw glazed pots is the same as firing a normal bisque 
              cycle then adding a glaze cycle to the end of it, Some clays demand 
              very gentle treatment during the water of crystallization release 
              phase and quartz inversion periods of the firing. It is my experience 
              that raw glaze will also present few firing problems and lately 
              I've been once firing in my fibre kiln in 13 hours. In the wood 
              kiln the cycle is between 16 and 20 hours . A 22 - 24 hour firing 
              cycle is very conservative, but it offers a starting point for any 
              one starting out. It is accomplished by leaving one burner on overnight 
              to get from 0&#176;C to 350&#176;C. A 16 hour cycle is a good average 
              firing with average temperature rise of 50&#176;C/hr in and glazes 
              I use. It should go without saying that before packing the kiln, 
              the pots should be thoroughly dry. It is my practice to pack the 
              kiln with all the pots touching each other as the completion of 
              shrinkage that occurs ensures good gaps between the pots by the 
              time the glazes begin to melt. Large pots and platters may need 
              some powdered alumina under them to allow for the large shrinkage 
              and ensure that they don't get caught on the shelf and crack. If 
              it isn't your normal practice to pull test rings (preferably E/W) 
              to determine that oxidation is complete before you start reduction, 
              I suggest you do, because you will not have a chance to rectify 
              lack of oxidation in a later firing and bloating may occur. </p>
            <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
            <p>I've tried to cover my technique for raw glazing in the hope that 
              you will be encouraged to try it. However, there is no substitute 
              for practice and practice will lead to craftsmanship. As a Chinese 
              philosopher said: &quot;I hear, I forget; I see, I understand; I 
              do, I remember.&quot; </p>
