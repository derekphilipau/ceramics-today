              <br>
              Making a Film Documentary on African Ceramics<br>
              by Ron du Bois, Professor Emeritus of Art, Oklahoma State University 
              <br>
              <br>
              From the start, our Nigerian Saga was ruled by chance, by luck, 
              by indeterminacy. We were led by forces whose effects could never 
              have been foreseen or predicted, such as a chance meeting in a type 
              of local eatery called a buka. My wife and I were the only Westerners 
              in a group of Nigerians gathered there for a noon meal. They were 
              curious to know about us and what we were doing in a local buka. 
              We told them we were from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, 
              Oklahoma, and were in Nigeria under Fulbright support. We were overwhelmed 
              when one of them said, &quot;I graduated from O.S.U. with a Ph.D. 
              in Epidemiology.&quot; His wife and children lived in Stillwater! 
              While I had never seen or met him in our university community, our 
              paths crossed in that buka on the campus of the University of Ile 
              Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). This meeting (no doubt arranged 
              by the Eshu, the Yoruba deity of chance) proved to be crucial and 
              auspicious to the film documentation of Yoruba women potters. 
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#ronalhaj"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/ronalhaj.jpg" width="76" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#23"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/23.jpg" width="90" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#22"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/22.jpg" width="178" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a> 
            <p> His name was Dr. Julius Afolabi, an engaging Nigerian whose grandmother 
              was a potter. His uncle, Sam Osashure, was an official in the city 
              of Ilorin, a major pottery production center about 60 miles northwest 
              of Ile Ife. His mother lived in a small village close to Ilorin. 
              Julius visited her on a regular basis. Would we like to come along 
              and meet his mother and his uncle and visit Dada Compound, where 
              a community of women potters worked year round? His uncle could 
              introduce me to the potters and strike some sort of arrangement 
              regarding filming them at work. It was the perfect opportunity to 
              begin fieldwork.
            <p> <a href="synchronicity_images.htm#42"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/42.jpg" width="153" height="110" hspace="2" border="1" align="left"></a>The 
              University of Ile Ife was our host institution and the heart of 
              the support system that made the project possible. The university 
              had an interesting and active ceramics program, headed by Ralph 
              Ibigbami, a potter, ceramic sculptor, and scholar. I would eventually 
              visit his home in Eshan Ekiti and record potters in that area. 
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#43"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/43.jpg" width="232" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#44"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/44.jpg" width="181" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
            <p> My initial Fulbright proposal had been reviewed and approved both 
              by Professor Ibigbami and Dr. Roland Abiodun, Art Department Chair. 
              They reported to the Fulbright program that they would take responsibility 
              for our welfare and accommodations, even though these matters had 
              not yet been formally accepted by the slow-moving university administration. 
              Despite their efforts, living accommodations were not available. 
              Instead we were housed in the university hotel for nearly three 
              months before finally securing a regular apartment where we could 
              unpack our luggage and I could prepare for my field research.
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#45"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/45.jpg" width="86" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#46"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/46.jpg" width="90" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
            <p>During this time my wife, Thora, a pianist, became a valued member 
              of the highly active music department and I began to get my bearings 
              at the university. It was located a short way from the ancient city 
              of Ile Ife, the place where, according to Yoruba belief, all human 
              beings were created. The city is famous for its production of both 
              terra cotta and brass-cast images of Yoruba kings and queens during 
              the middle ages. It is the center of the Yoruba spiritual world.
            <p align="center"><a href="file:///F|/My%20Documents/HTML/Ceramics%20Today/articles/synchronicity_images.htm#47"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/47.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#58"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/58.jpg" width="142" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
            <p> I had to abandon my preconceptions on the first visit. The paved 
              streets, heavy traffic of buses, cars, trucks, taxis, and motorcycles 
              immediately dispelled the image of Ile Ife as an African city of 
              the past. Instead I found, as did the early Portuguese, that the 
              city was bustling with industry, energy and street life.
            <p><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#48"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/48.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" border="1" align="left"></a>In 
              spite of the influence of Western religions, traditional Yoruba 
              religion was still vital. The ancient festivals were still being 
              performed. I was able to interview an Ifa priest &#8211; a revealing 
              experience in it's own right. As I videotaped daily life and festivals 
              in Ile Ife, I had no specific understanding of how the scenes would 
              be used, and several of them became important sections of the documentaries, 
              providing a striking contrast between contemporary city life and 
              the traditional pace and practices of the women potters. 
            <p> The United States Information Service was a crucial part of our 
              support system. The Lagos office received our ten boxes of luggage 
              and the critical shipment of ECN (Eastman Kodak Color Negative) 
              16 mm film. These were then transferred to the Ibaden USIS office. 
              USIS personnel arranged for accommodations in Ibaden and the final 
              stage of our trip by car to the University of Ile Ife.
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#49"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/49.jpg" width="140" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#50"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/50.jpg" width="89" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#51"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/51.jpg" width="136" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
            <p>We had no transportation of our own and the prospect of buying 
              a car and driving in Nigeria was daunting. Eventually, by chance, 
              we did acquire a Volvo station wagon and I was able to make regular 
              trips to Ilorin. I even learned to drive in Lagos. The driving conditions 
              are so scary in that city that I preferred to maintain an illusion 
              of control and safety by claiming the wheel myself. 
            <p> <a href="synchronicity_images.htm#52"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/52.jpg" width="148" height="110" hspace="2" border="1" align="left"></a>The 
              initial trip to Ilorin was made in Julius' car. His mother welcomed 
              us with warm hospitality and a hearty bowl of famous Yoruba stew. 
              Then we visited Julius' uncle, Sam Osashure. He knew the head mistress 
              of the potters at Dada Compound and made arrangements on my behalf 
              for filming and videotaping throughout the compound. The head mistress 
              asked for and received a cash payment in return for this arrangement. 
            <p> Once the word went out that payment had been made, the normally 
              reserved and camera-shy women allowed me complete freedom to roam 
              the compound, to photograph, and to film. Normally they do not welcome 
              strangers. They live in a closed society that protects their craft 
              secrets. They believe that if they share their craft, the ancestors 
              who taught them might not approve. Pottery is their only means of 
              livelihood and the processes are traditionally taught only to those 
              born into the hereditary profession of potter.
            <p> <a href="synchronicity_images.htm#53"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/53.jpg" width="161" height="110" hspace="2" border="1" align="left"></a>I 
              believe the women made an exception for me because of the way I 
              had gained admission, i.e., through influential Yoruba friends who 
              followed the correct procedures and spoke their language. Julius' 
              and Sam's negotiations and preparations were crucial to successfully 
              documenting this famous pottery community. 
            <p> I needed a base of operations in Ilorin, food and shelter, and 
              a place to store my equipment. The United Church of West Africa 
              maintained economical living quarters in the city. Dr. Afolabi made 
              arrangements for me to stay there during the week until the project 
              was completed. On weekends I returned to the campus in Ile Ife to 
              visit my wife, and catch up on campus life. These arrangements worked 
              perfectly. My UCWA room was a fraction of the cost of a hotel. It 
              had a bed, table and chair, and most importantly, a shower. The 
              gates were closed at night, so it was a safe place to park my Volvo.
            <p> My schedule was the same, week after week. I got up, ate, picked 
              up Dr. Afolabi's brother, Shola, who was my translator, and went 
              to Dada Compound to observe, study, ask questions, and film until 
              sunset. Sometimes I gave a few of the potters a ride home. (They 
              usually walked to work in the morning and left the compound well 
              after dark, taking a bus home.)
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#54"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/54.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#55"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/55.jpg" width="135" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
<p> I established rapport with the women in a number of ways. Initially, 
              rather than taking the large 16 mm camera into the compound, I began 
              shooting with my small 8 mm video camera. When they saw themselves 
              in the playback mode, they understood what I was doing, and the 
              ice was broken.
            <p> They understood I was a potter because I helped them with their 
              clay and wedging tasks. I was not able to keep up with them. Their 
              strength and stamina came from wedging clay every day since childhood. 
              As potters, they performed amazing feats of endurance and strength. 
              <br>
              They must have thought it odd that a male was a potter. Yoruba culture 
              traditionally has been gender specific regarding work, insisting 
              that women perform tasks associated with hearth and home and that 
              men perform tasks outside the home. When questioned, master-potter 
              Alhaja said she was not aware that men were potters in Northern 
              Nigeria. She believed that custom and tradition call women to pottery, 
              yet couldn't think of any specific restriction against men becoming 
              potters. The question had never come up.
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#56"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/56.jpg" width="140" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#57"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/57.jpg" width="135" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
<p> My contacts at the University of Ile Ife referred me to Dr. N.A. 
              Olaoye, a specialist in craft technologies at the University of 
              Ilorin. Much of the narration was based on the information and research 
              he provided. <br>
              It seems impossible to pick out any one of many interacting factors 
              of chance and luck as being most important, but the departure of 
              my department head, Rowland Abiodun, for the U.S. was a crucial 
              breakthrough. His leave of absence made it possible for him to loan 
              me his Volvo station wagon for over four months. The project would 
              have been far more difficult without Roland's trusty Volvo. I'm 
              happy to report that I was able to return it to him in better condition 
              than when he left. 
            <p><a href="synchronicity_images.htm#3"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/3.jpg" width="165" height="110" hspace="2" border="1" align="left"></a>In 
              1988 I returned from Nigeria with 10,000 feet of 16 mm Eastman Kodak 
              Color Negative motion picture film. The film was developed in the 
              U.S. I also had considerable 8 mm videotape that was to prove extremely 
              valuable. With the advent of digital technology, we were able to 
              digitize both film and video for editing purposes. Without the digital 
              technology that came into use well after my return from Nigeria, 
              the documentaries in their present form would have been more complex 
              and expensive.
