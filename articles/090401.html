              all the kinds of artifacts which may be found at archaeological 
              sites, ceramics are surely one of the most important. Ceramic artifacts 
              are extremely durable, and may last tens of thousands of years virtually 
              unchanged from the date of manufacture. And ceramic artifacts, unlike 
              stone tools, are completely person-made, shaped of clay and purposely 
              fired. Clay figurines are known from the earliest human occupations, 
              but clay vessels, pottery vessels used for storing, cooking and 
              serving food, and carrying water were first manufactured at least 
              12-13,000 years ago, and perhaps a little earlier yet. </p>
            <p>Shards from the earliest pottery vessels known in the world have 
              been found at the Kamino site in southwestern Japan. This site has 
              a stone tool assemblage which appears to classify it as late Paleolithic, 
              called <a
href="http://133.12.178.4/Faculty/Keally/palaeol.html">Pre-ceramic</a> in Japanese 
              archaeology to separate it from the Lower Paleolithic cultures of 
              Europe and the mainland. At the Kamino site in addition to a handful 
              of potshards were found microblades, wedge-shaped microcores, spearheads 
              and other artifacts similar to assemblages at Pre-ceramic sites 
              in Japan dated between 14,000 and 16,000 years before the present 
              (BP); furthermore this layer is stratigraphically below a securely 
              dated Initial Jomon occupation of 12,000 BP. The ceramic shards 
              are not decorated, and are very small and fragmentary.</p>
            <p>Ceramic shards are also found, also in small quantities, but with 
              a bean-impression decoration, in a half-dozen sites of the Mikoshiba-Chojukado 
              sites of southwestern Japan, also dated to the late Pre-ceramic 
              period. These pots are bag shaped but somewhat pointed at the bottom, 
              and sites with these shards include the <a
href="http://133.12.178.4/Faculty/Keally/Reports/Chronologies/aomori.html">Odaiyamamoto</a> 
              and Ushirono sites, and Senpukuji Cave.&nbsp; Like those of the 
              Kamino site, these shards are also quite rare, suggesting that although 
              the technology was known to the Late Pre-ceramic cultures, it just 
              was not terribly useful to their nomadic lifestyle.</p>
            <p>In contrast, ceramics were very useful indeed to the Jomon peoples. 
              In Japanese, the word &quot;Jomon&quot; means &quot;cord-mark,&quot; 
              as in cord-marked decoration on pottery. The <a href="http://133.12.178.4/Faculty/Keally/jomon.html">Jomon 
              tradition</a> is the name given to hunter-gatherer cultures in Japan 
              from about 13,000 to 2500 BP, when migrating populations from the 
              mainland brought fulltime wet rice agriculture. For the entire ten 
              millennia, the Jomon peoples used ceramic vessels for storage and 
              cooking. Incipient Jomon ceramics are identified by patterns of 
              lines applied onto a bag-shaped vessel. Later, as on the mainland, 
              highly <a
href="http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/mus_dict/hd32e.html">decorated vessels</a> were
              also manufactured by the Jomon peoples.</p>
            <p>By 10,000 BP, the use of ceramics may be found throughout mainland 
              China, and by 5,000 BP ceramic vessels can be found throughout the 
              world, both independently invented in the Americas or spread by 
              diffusion into the middle eastern Neolithic cultures. </p>
