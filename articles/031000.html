        exhibition from the Japan Foundation�s collection provided a comprehensive 
        representation of 30 eminent Japanese contemporary ceramists. Also included 
        in this exhibition were the works of several well known Australian contemporary 
        ceramists. to procure a �cultural entanglement� as described in the opening 
        speech by Mr. Kagefumi Ueno, Consul-General of Japan. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In Japan &quot;Ceramic Sculpturing&quot; 
        is the term used to describe works that break from the traditional confines 
        of practical ceramics into freer forms combining traditional techniques 
        with sculpting. Its origins can be traced back to the post war era in 
        1946 when Japan�s exposure to western artistic trends in the postwar era 
        led to the formation of small avant-garde ceramic groups such as the influential 
        Sodeisha group. Established in Kyoto in 1948 the main focus of the Sodeisha 
        was on self-expression in contrast to the preservation of traditional 
        practices.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Black earthenware was a prominent feature 
        of the exhibition. This pre-industrial process is favored by contemporary 
        Japanese ceramists. since it gives a direct and uncompromising expression 
        to the formal sculptural qualities in the works. It doesn't compromise 
        the inherent primal properties of clay as opposed to the more traditional 
        methods of decorating and glazing the works. Yagi Kazuo (1918-79) a founding 
        member of the Sodeisha developed the black-firing method in the early 
        1960s.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Since the formation of the Sodeisha, Kyoto 
        has been regarded as the center of experimental ceramics in Japan. Included 
        in the exhibition is the work of Yo Akiyama (b. 1953), a third generation 
        artist who teaches at the Kyoto City University of Arts where he mastered 
        the technique of black-firing as a student of Yagi Kazuo in the mid 1970s. 
        His cracked expanses of carbon impregnated clay relate to the geology 
        and metaphysical beauty of the earth.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Ryoji Koei (b. 1938) has since the 1980s 
        been involved in �ceramic happenings� which emphasizes the processes rather 
        than the products. His recent works explore the man made horrors of the 
        modern world - the work in this exhibition <i>White Object, 1989 </i>expresses 
        his concerns with the Chernobyl disaster. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Kinpei Nakamura (b. 1935) parodies Japanese 
        taste in popular culture using kitsch aesthetics combining traditional 
        colors of Kabuki with industrial debris. As a teacher at Tama University 
        of Arts in Tokyo, Naramura has contributed to Tokyo�s emergence as an 
        epicenter of new and challenging ideas in contemporary ceramics.</font></p>
