" width="190" height="379" align="left">The <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/"><b>Cleveland 
              Museum of Art</b></a> (CMA) welcomes the landmark exhibition The 
              Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in Europe and America, 1880&#8211;1920: 
              Design for the Modern World, on view Oct. 16, 2005, to Jan. 8, 2006. 
              This groundbreaking exhibition, organized by the <a href="http://www.lacma.org/"><b>Los 
              Angeles County Museum of Art</b></a> (LACMA), is the first to demonstrate 
              the significance of the widespread international Arts and Crafts 
              movement of Europe and the United States.
            <p> Including more than 300 influential objects created in all media 
              between 1880 and 1920, from ceramic and metalwork to textiles and 
              works on paper, this exhibition demonstrates the evolution of the 
              object and the way that the object affected one&#8217;s life during 
              this period of time, advancing the dawn of the modern age.
            <p> The Arts and Crafts movement began as a reaction to social and 
              economic anxiety after nearly a century of intense industrial modernization. 
              Great Britain, the most industrialized country at the turn of the 
              century, became the initial hub of the Arts and Crafts movement. 
              The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was founded in 1887 in London 
              on the belief that a culture&#8217;s applied art was as vital to 
              that culture as its fine art. Individuality in a crafter&#8217;s 
              piece, along with innovation and creativity, molded the Arts and 
              Crafts Exhibition Society into a significant artistic movement that 
              later grew into one of a philosophical, political and cultural nature. 
            <p>Members of the society, including John Ruskin and William Morris, 
              advocated the improvement of working conditions, the reintegration 
              of art into everyday life and the unification of all forms of art. 
              The movement&#8217;s principles were widely spread by the start 
              of the twentieth century and had developed into a language of democratic 
              phrases including &#8220;joy in labor,&#8221; &#8220;unity in design,&#8221; 
              and &#8220;fidelity to place.&#8221; These potent phrases allowed 
              the public to visualize the Arts and Crafts movement&#8217;s many 
              ideologies.

" width="153" height="221" align="left">&#8220;This exhibition looks at how the 
              philosophies of the Arts and Crafts movement spread across Europe 
              and to the United States influencing not only the way objects were 
              made, but how they looked and were used,&#8221; CMA Curator of Decorative 
              Arts and Design Stephen Harrison said. &#8220;This landmark exhibition 
              is the first to examine how widespread the Arts and Crafts movement 
              became as designers and consumers alike embraced its ideals,&#8221; 
              Harrison added. The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in Europe and America, 
              1880&#8211;1920: Design for the Modern World will include objects 
              made in England, Scotland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Denmark, Norway, 
              Sweden, Finland, Belgium, France, and the United States. 
            <p> Seventy-five institutions and private collections have lent exceptional 
              objects, including many masterworks by key designers of the period, 
              such as Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s (American, 1867&#8211;1959) Table 
              Lamp from the Susan Lawrence Dana House (pictured below) and a chair 
              from his studio in Oak Park, Illinois; views of Greene and Greene&#8217;s 
              (American) Robert R. Blacker House, along with an armchair and cabinet 
              from the house; William Morris&#8217;s (British, 1834&#8211;1896) 
              textile Rose; Josef Hoffmann&#8217;s (Austrian, 1870&#8211;1956)

" width="238" height="319" align="left">Art 
              and Industry</b> 
            <p>Though the Arts and Crafts movement regarded its pre-industrial 
              past in the highest respect, it did not completely discard the present. 
              The movement had a few conflicting ideals, including a belief that 
              machines should be used as a way to rid workers of mindless tasks 
              rather than for mass production, and the idea that objects should 
              be useful to as well as being affordable for the average person. 
              Even though the movement struggled with these two opposing views, 
              what was most important to the movement was the &#8216;process of 
              making&#8217; an object. 
            <p> <b>Design and the National Identity</b>
            <p>The Arts and Crafts Movement believed that a country&#8217;s character 
              could be expressed through design and reinforced by that design. 
              Designers, craftsmen and artists used this technique in their fields. 
              This became a new form of patriotism, known today as Romantic Nationalism.

" width="153" height="203" align="left">One 
              of the most important and fundamental concepts of the Arts and Crafts 
              movement was the idea of the complete integration of art and everyday 
              life. This was done most thoroughly through utopian art colonies 
              around the globe. Four of these art colonies have been included 
              in this exhibition, including Darmstadt, Germany; C. R. Ashbee&#8217;s 
              Guild of the Handicraft in Britain; G&ouml;d&ouml;llo, Hungary; 
              and the Roycrofters of East Aurora, New York. <br>
              These three themes envelop several issues still debated today, including 
              individuality versus standardization of objects and the definition 
              of a design that most benefits society. 
            <p>This exhibition was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum 
              of Art and was made possible by Max Palevsky. This project is supported 
              in part by an award from the National Endowment for the Arts.
