              ware is well known to practitioners of the tea ceremony, but its 
              relatively limited and specialized production has caused its four 
              hundred year history to be overlooked by many lovers of Japanese 
              ceramics. The various tribulations and triumphs of the Takatori 
              potters are remarkably well documented in a number of historical 
              sources dating from the Edo period (1615-1867), bringing a moving, 
              human side to the story of these elegant wares. Furthermore, archaeological 
              excavation of a majority of the seven Takatori kilnsites, has helped 
              to define the stylistic development of the wares. Thus, both the 
              historical significance and the aesthetic appeal of Takatori ware 
              make it worthy of wider recognition.</p>
            <p>As was the case with other high-fired ceramics from southwestern 
              Japan, including Arita (Imari), Satsuma, Hagi and Karatsu, the first 
              makers of Takatori ware were Korean potters who were brought to 
              Japan during and immediately following the Japanese invasions of 
              Korea between 1592 and 1598. Takatori ware was the official ceramic 
              of the Kuroda, rulers of Chikuzen province (now Fukuoka prefecture), 
              for nearly 300 years until the abolition of the domain system in 
              1871.</p>
            <p><b>The Beginnings of Takatori Ware and the Eimanji Takuma Kiln 
              (ca. 1600 - 1614)</b></p>
            <p>Although most of the Korean potters were brought to Japan as captives, 
              it appears that the first Takatori potter, whose Korean name was 
              Palsan, may have come willingly, since his wife and child were allowed 
              to accompany him and he was given a generous stipend by Kuroda Nagamasa 
              (memorial portrait as a monk, above), the warlord responsible for 
              his arrival. In 1600, Nagamasa and his army of retainers, were awarded 
              the province of Chikuzen, located on the northern coast of Kyushu, 
              as a reward for services rendered in the battle of Sekigahara, in 
              which Tokugawa Ieyasu and his supporters defeated Ishida Mitsunari 
              and the supporters of Hideyoshi's heir, gaining control over the 
              entire country. Soon after, Palsan and his father-in-law, known 
              only by his Japanese name Shinkur&ocirc;, built a kiln on the eastern 
              border of the province, at the base of Takatori Mountain (east of 
              present-day N&ocirc;gata city). Kuroda Nagamasa gave Palsan the 
              family name 'Takatori' after the site of the kiln, and changed his 
              Korean name to the Japanese name of Hachiz&ocirc;.</p>
            <p>Today, the site of the first Takatori kiln is known as Eimanji 
              Takuma. The site has been excavated by archaeologists who found 
              that the wares made there by Takatori Hachiz&ocirc; and his helpers 
              were of a dark colored, sandy clay and were covered in simple glazes 
              based on straw ash and wood ash. Many of the pieces were thickly 
              made as a result of the poor fire-resistance of the clay, and were 
              utilitarian in nature, although some wares for tea were fired at 
              Eimanji Takuma as well. The kiln structure was of the 'split-bamboo' 
              type of 'climbing' kiln commonly found in Korea in the sixteenth 
              century and had six chambers.</p>
            <p><b>The Uchigaso Kiln (1614 - 1620s)</b></p>
            <center>
            </center>
            <a href="images/takatori/waterjar.jpg"><img src="images/takatori/waterjar_sm.jpg" alt="Takatori Water Jar" width="104" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>After 
            locating better clay, Takatori Hachiz&ocirc; received permission in 
            1614 to move production to a site several kilometers to the north. 
            At this new kiln, called Uchigaso, the scale of production was greatly 
            increased, as numerous apprentices were taken on and a huge fourteen 
            chamber climbing kiln was built, modeled on an improved style of kiln 
            used in neighboring Hizen province (home of Karatsu stoneware and 
            Arita porcelain). Hachiz&ocirc; and his son Hachir&ocirc;emon were 
            given higher stipends by the Kuroda domain in reward for their fine 
            work. 
            <p>Excavations have revealed that a wide variety of ceramics were 
              fired at the Uchigaso kiln during its eight years of operation. 
              In addition to dishes, bowls and other utilitarian wares, beautiful 
              and stylistically daring tea ceremony utensils were produced as 
              well. These display such techniques as glaze splashing, stamped 
              decoration, incising, openwork and, rarely, underglaze painting. 
              Perhaps the most significant stylistic aspect of Uchigaso teawares, 
              however, is widespread use of purposeful distortion of shape, similar 
              to that found in Oribe ware (Mino province, modern Gifu prefecture) 
              of the same period. Wares of this type from the Uchigaso kiln have 
              been recovered in large numbers in teaware-related excavations in 
              Kyoto, proving not only that Uchigaso wares were exported to other 
              parts of Japan during the early seventeenth century, but that they 
              were even popular with the most sophisticated tea connoisseurs in 
              Japan's cultural center. (Figures above: water jar for tea with 
              decorative handles, Fukuoka Art Museum; and cake dish for tea with 
              bridge handle and openwork design).</p>
            <p><b>The Yamada Kiln (mid-1620s - 1630)</b></p>
            <p>At some point in the 1620s, the Korean potter Hachiz&ocirc; applied 
              to return to his home country. Records are unclear about the exact 
              date, and there is debate over whether this occured as early as 
              1623, the year Kuroda Nagamasa died, or several years later. In 
              any event, Nagamasa's son Tadayuki, the new lord, was incensed at 
              Hachiz&ocirc;'s presumptuous request, and confined him and his family 
              to the village of Yamada (modern Yamada city) where they were forced 
              to live with no stipend, subsisting on the sale of utilitarian wares 
              to local residents. Although the site of the Yamada kiln is known, 
              it was buried by refuse from coal mining operations in the 1940s 
              and is now inaccessible.</p>
            <p><b>The Shirahatayama Kiln (1630 - 1660s)</b></p>
            <p>Around 1630 Kuroda Tadayuki lifted Hachiz&ocirc;'s banishment and 
              directed him to build yet another new kiln. The site chosen was 
              Shirahatayama, a mountain north of modern Iizuka city. According 
              to Edo period records, Tadayuki sent Hachiz&ocirc; and his son Hachir&ocirc;emon 
              to Fushimi in Kyoto to meet with the famed tea master Kobori Ensh&ucirc; 
              (1579-1647) and to receive his directions concerning teaware style. 
              (tea bowl of <i>kirikata</i> type designed by Kobori Ensh&ucirc;, 
              from the Fukuoka Art Museum, below).</p>
            <p>Ensh&ucirc; was well known for his <i>kirei sabi</i> aesthetic 
              which combined the subdued and plain preferences of Sen Riky&ucirc; 
              (1520-1591) with a taste for elegant and smooth forms appealing 
              to Ensh&ucirc;'s daimyo tea disciples. Thus the wares produced at 
              Shirahatayama became thinner and sleeker than those of earlier kilns. 
              Excavations of the site show that the kiln size (seven chambers) 
              was much smaller than Uchigaso and that production centered on specialty 
              wares for tea to the exclusion of utilitarian ceramics. Kuroda domain 
              letters show that Lord Tadayuki was personally involved with directing 
              production at Shirahatayama and was well acquainted with Kobori 
              Ensh&ucirc;. This indicates that Shirahatayama was indeed a <i>go-y&ocirc;-gama</i>, 
              a kiln operating under the control and direction of a domain lord. 
              Tadayuki also brought Igarashi Jizaemon, a ceramics technician from 
              Hizen province, to Shirahatayama to improve firing and other technical 
              aspects of production. The Igarashi family would remain an integral 
              part of Takatori production until the end of the Edo period.</p>
            <p>The most famous products of the Shirahatayama kiln were tea caddies, 
              small ceramics containers for powdered tea. (See example of tea 
              container with decorative handles, named &quot;Somekawa&quot; or 
              Dyed River, above). Some of the finest Takatori tea caddies were 
              given titles and box inscriptions by Kobori Ensh&ucirc; himself 
              and were later designated <i>ch&ucirc;ko meibutsu</i> (Recent Treasures) 
              by the important teaware connoisseur Matsudaira Fumai (1751 - 1818). 
              In fact, more Takatori tea caddies received this high designation 
              than those of any other Japanese kiln with the exception of Seto. 
              Takatori tea caddies became known for their extremely thin walls, 
              elegant shapes, fine clay and beautiful, multi-hued glazes, trademarks 
              which continue to characterize them today.</p>
            <p><b>The Tsuzumi Kiln (1660s - 1680s)</b></p>
            <p>Takatori Hachiz&ocirc; died in 1654 and was buried near the site 
              of the Shirahatayama kiln. His eldest son Hachir&ocirc;emon had 
              become sickly and was unable to take over production, so Hachiz&ocirc;'s 
              younger son Hachiz&ocirc; Sadaaki succeeded to family leadership. 
              At some time in the 1660s production was moved to Tsuzumi village, 
              in the southernmost corner of the province, just south of the modern 
              pottery village of Koishiwara. The reason for the move is uncertain, 
              but a few test pieces of porcelain found at the Uchigaso and Shirahatayama 
              kilns seem to indicate that the Kuroda domain wanted the Takatori 
              potters to begin large-scale porcelain production and that the raw 
              materials for doing so were to be found in or near Tsuzumi. Accordingly, 
              porcelain production was begun within a few years of the move, not 
              at Tsuzumi, but at the Kaminoharu kiln in what is now Koishiwara 
              village. The Takatori Tsuzumi kiln, however, continued to operate 
              separately. There Takatori Hachiz&ocirc; Sadaaki and other members 
              of the growing family continued to produce tea caddies and other 
              teawares, although Hachir&ocirc;emon's second son, Hachinoj&ocirc;, 
              moved to Koishiwara, perhaps to aid potters from the Arita area 
              with porcelain manufacture at Kaminoharu. After this, stoneware 
              kilns were established at Koishiwara, producing utilitarian wares 
              which made the village's fame as a folk ceramics center, a reputation 
              that continues even now.</p>
            <p><b>The Oganotani Kiln (1680s - 1704)</b></p>
            During the early 1680s, the new Kuroda lord, Mitsuyuki (portrait above), 
            began to require Hachiz&ocirc; Sadaaki and his nephew and family heir 
            Hachir&ocirc; to throw wares on the wheel at a temporary workshop 
            within the grounds of the castle in Fukuoka. Lord Mitsuyuki and his 
            son Tsunamasa enjoyed watching the potters work, and made suggestions 
            concerning the types of wares they wished to have made. The finished 
            wares were then transported overland to Tsuzumi for glazing and firing. 
            The danger in which this operation placed the unfired wares was so 
            high that in the 1680s production was transferred to a site called 
            Oganotani, only a few kilometers south of Fukuoka castle. 
            <p>At Oganotani a samurai named Inatomi Kizaemon carved small ceramic 
              sculptural pieces such as incense burners and incense boxes. These 
              were fired in the Oganotani kiln, and bear Inatomi's artist name, 
              Taiky&ucirc;ken H&ocirc;enshi. (An example of an incense burner 
              bearing this signature can be seen above). Other examples of Takatori 
              wares from this kiln which utilized the talents of other artists 
              include tea bowls bearing designs painted by the Kyoto artist Miyazaki 
              Y&ucirc;zen, credited with perfecting the silk dyeing technique 
              known as <i>y&ucirc;zen-zome</i>. The Oganotani kilnsite has not 
              been excavated, but a large number of tea caddy sherds have been 
              recovered near the site of the old kiln, indicating that tea caddies 
              continued to form a large part of production.</p>
            <p>The multi-faceted activity of Oganotani came to an abrupt end in 
              1704 when the kiln was abruptly closed down by the domain. According 
              to records, ceramics ordered through the domain by the Edo government 
              commissioner of Nagasaki were not produced as required, and as a 
              result the potters were forced by the domain to cease production 
              and the kiln was dismantled. The Takatori potters were thus left 
              without employment, a state which lasted thirteen full years. Unlike 
              Hachiz&ocirc; at the Yamada kiln (as described above), however, 
              this time the potters continued to receive minimal stipends despite 
              their forced unemployment.</p>
            <p><b>The Higashi Sarayama Kiln (1716 - 1871)</b></p>
            <p>In 1716, the Takatori potters were returned to active production, 
              but under much stricter control by the Kuroda domain. A domain ceramics 
              commissioner was appointed who was responsible for enforcing a series 
              of regulations relating to all aspects of the potters' work. By 
              this time there were four branches of the Takatori family involved 
              in production as well as one family comprised of the descendants 
              of Igarashi Jizaemon. The main line of the Takatori family was the 
              lineage of eldest sons descended through Hachir&ocirc;emon, Hachiz&ocirc;'s 
              eldest son; it was responsible for representing the potters in their 
              dealings with the domain. The potters of this line continued to 
              reside in Tsuzumi village, while the descendants of Hachinoj&ocirc; 
              maintained their residence in Koishiwara, both branches fullfilling 
              their potting duties in Fukuoka in six month stints all the while. 
              The other two Takatori branches, however, moved to Fukuoka, as did 
              the Igarashi family.</p>
            <p>The new kiln was located west of Fukuoka castle in Sohara village 
              (now the Nishijin area of Fukuoka city). Only two years later, in 
              1718, a new group of kilns firing utilitarian wares was established 
              by the domain less than half a kilometer to the west of the Takatori 
              kiln. This kiln group became known as Nishi Sarayama (West Plate 
              Mountain) to distinguish it from the Takatori kiln, which subsequently 
              acquired the name Higashi Yama (East Mountain) or Higashi Sarayama 
              (East Plate Mountain), the name by which it is known today. Teawares 
              and other elite ceramics were fired at the Higashi Sarayama kiln 
              (See flower vase of broad, thin-rimmed type above), and all production 
              was required to be submitted each year to the domain for distribution 
              to domain members or for use as gifts to lords of other domains 
              or even to the shogun himself. The Nishi Sarayama kilns, on the 
              other hand, produced jars, ceramic flasks and kitchen mortars of 
              a rough, reddish-brown stoneware for sale to raise revenue for the 
              han.</p>
            <p>The new system worked smoothly through most of the eighteenth century, 
              but around 1770 the Kuroda domain suddenly reduced the samurai rank 
              of the Takatori potters. The potters immediately took steps to persuade 
              the domain elders to restore their former status, most significantly 
              by compiling and submitting records of Takatori production history. 
              This task was performed by Takatori Tadasaku J&ocirc;shun, head 
              of the main line, who applied to the domain three times before the 
              potters' status was restored. The principal influential document 
              was the <i>Sarayama yakusho kiroku</i> (Sarayama Office Record), 
              compiled in 1779. In addition, Tadasaku used the same records to 
              create a work called the <i>Takatori-ke kiroku</i> (Record of the 
              Takatori House, 1781) specifically for the Takatori potters themselves. 
              These two works were later combined in a single document, the <i>Takatori 
              rekidai kiroku</i> (Record of the Historical Generations of the 
              Takatori Family), which has survived in several versions. If not 
              for the crisis brought about by the reduction of the Takatori potters' 
              status, these documents might never have been compiled and much 
              less would be known about Takatori history today. It is also worth 
              noting that much of the information in these documents dealing with 
              the seventeenth century is corroborated by sections of the scholar 
              Kaibara Ekken's <i>Chikuzen no kuni zoku fudoki</i> (Gazetteer of 
              Chikuzen Province, Continued), published in 1708.</p>
            <p>The next significant recorded event in Takatori history was the 
              domain requirement in 1823 that all &quot;presentation pieces&quot; 
              (<i>kenj&ocirc;hin</i>) submitted bear a stamp known as the <i>marutaka</i>, 
              a circle surrounding the character <i>taka</i> of 'Takatori' (see 
              closeup below of inscription on broad, thin-rimmed flower vase base). 
              Since in principle all wares had to be submitted to the Kuroda domain, 
              this requirement generally has been misconstrued to mean all wares 
              were required to bear the stamp from that year forward. However, 
              dozens of sherds recovered from the site of the Higashi Sarayama 
              kiln have yielded only one bearing the <i>marutaka</i> mark, showing 
              that the order specified only one class of objects: wares for presentation, 
              either to the lord or to elites outside the domain.</p>
            <p><a href="images/takatori/marutaka.jpg"><img src="images/takatori/marutaka_sm.jpg" alt="Marutaka mark " width="71" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              Takatori potters had continued to produce tea utensils for use by 
              Kuroda domain members and for gifts from the domain to high personages 
              in other domains or in the capitol Edo, but they also expanded the 
              types of wares made to include elite tablewares, handbasins and 
              planters. In the eighteenth century the potters also began to produce 
              alcove ornaments (see carp ornament below) -- glazed stoneware figures 
              of birds, animals or auspicious beings such as the Seven Gods of 
              Good Fortune (<i>Shichifukujin</i>). These were carved during the 
              winter months when the weather was too cold to throw on the wheel. 
              From the nineteenth century the bases of some wares began to bear 
              the incised names of the makers, along with the <i>marutaka</i> 
              mark (see base inscription above), but the majority of wares seem 
              to have remained unmarked.</p>
            <p><a href="images/takatori/okimono.jpg"><img src="images/takatori/okimono_sm.jpg" alt="Takatori Fish Sculpture" width="103" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              principal clay used at the Higashi Sarayama kiln fired to a light 
              fawn color and had surprising density and strength, almost approaching 
              that of porcelain. Documents record that the source of this clay 
              was Mukaesano village, located within the modern city limits of 
              Dazaifu city, more than fifteen kilometers to the southeast. The 
              clay was heavily refined to produce a dense stoneware. Glazes were 
              produced by combining a variety of types of glazing stone, ash, 
              and mineral colorants such as iron. As had been the case throughout 
              Takatori history, the juxtaposition of contrasting glazes, both 
              subtle and bold, continued to be a major characteristic of Takatori 
              style. Of particular note is a golden-yellow glaze called <i>d&ocirc;keiy&ucirc;</i> 
              (lit. 'road-shape-glaze') which beads or runs in rivulets on the 
              ceramic surface, making a small, repeating pattern on a vessel, 
              over which a brightly colored splash of contrasting glaze might 
              be applied for effect (deep tea bowl below). The <i>d&ocirc;keiy&ucirc;</i> 
              glaze was adopted at Seto and elsewhere, where it was generally 
              known as <i>takatori-y&ucirc;</i> (Takatori glaze). A thick, translucent 
              glaze of a deep green to greenish-yellow color called <i>takamiya-y&ucirc;</i> 
              was another commonly used glaze at Higashi Sarayama (as on the flower 
              vase above). </p>

            <p>The area in which the Higashi Sarayama kiln was located has become 
              a residential area and few traces of the kiln itself survive, but 
              information given on a drawing of the kiln workshop dating from 
              1816 states that the kiln had eight chambers. Since the kiln was 
              undoubtedly rebuilt numerous times during the nearly 150 years of 
              production at Higashi Sarayama, however, we do not know whether 
              or not the number of chambers was consistent throughout the period.

            <p><b>Beginning of the Meiji Period (1867 - 1912) and the Abolition 
              of the Domain (1871)</b></p>
            <p>Production seems to have progressed fairly uneventfully until the 
              abdication of the shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1867 and the abolition 
              of the domain system in 1871. At that time, the Takatori potters 
              lost their stipends and most of them eventually ceased potting. 
              The head of the main family returned to his home in Tsuzumi and 
              even the potting families who lived near the kiln appear to have 
              abandoned ceramic production, apparently either unable or unwilling 
              to take on the additional arduous tasks of procuring raw materials 
              and fuel (tasks which previously had been handled through the domain) 
              and the commercial distribution of the finished products.</p>
            <p><b>Transfer of the Takatori Style</b></p>
            <p>The potters at nearby Nishi Sarayama, however, had wider experience 
              in practical matters of ceramics as a business and made use of their 
              established production system to take over the recently liberalized 
              Takatori style. It is unclear how soon after the beginning of the 
              Meiji period this began, but it is evident that within ten years 
              of the Meiji emperor's accession in 1868, wares in Takatori style 
              were being produced in large numbers by potters who had made only 
              utilitarian ware during the Edo period. The new wares bore the <i>marutaka</i> 
              mark on the bottom and were thinly made of lightly colored clay 
              and glazed with Takatori style glazes. In comparison to Higashi 
              Sarayama wares, Meiji period wares from Nishi Sarayama kilns have 
              a somewhat dry-looking, less dense and less hard whitish clay, a 
              tendency toward elaborate carved and molded decoration on vessels 
              and very widespread use of <i>d&ocirc;keiy&ucirc;</i> glazing (see 
              sake flask below). The <i>marutaka</i> mark also varies slightly 
              from its Edo period counterpart, with the corners of the taka character 
              somewhat rounder than the original. Relatively few tea ceremony 
              wares appear to have been made at these kilns compared to objects 
              such as decorative flower vases, steeped tea (<i>sencha</i>) utensils 
              as well as stylishly fashioned tablewares. So completely did the 
              Nishi Sarayama potters appropriate the Takatori style and name that 
              after World War II the area surrounding their kilns was officially 
              renamed 'Takatori,' while the area of the defunct Higashi Sarayama 
              kiln to the east retained the older name, Nishijin.</p>
            <p>At least half a dozen workshops were active in the Nishi Sarayama 
              area from the middle of the 1880s until the 1940s, producing a wide 
              variety of ceramics, including industrial pieces such as ceramic 
              barrels, pump spouts and acid resistant storage containers. After 
              the war, cheaply made metal and plastic vessels reduced the market 
              for many of the ceramic items produced there. Only one kiln, that 
              of the Kamei family (which claims a member of a Higashi Sarayama 
              potting family as an ancestor), has succeeded in thriving by riding 
              the crest of renewed interest in the tea ceremony, particularly 
              in the postwar period. Another Nishi Sarayama potting family, named 
              Hara, now maintains a Takatori style kiln elsewhere in Fukuoka city.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, some members of the original Takatori families returned 
              to potting after their preliminary abandonment of the profession. 
              During the Meiji period, Takatori Eiichi, head of one of the four 
              family branches at the end of the Edo period, headed several kilns 
              which produced mostly small tablewares and tea ceremony utensils. 
              Production was not, however, continued by his heirs after his death 
              in 1910. Takatori families in Tsuzumi and Koishiwara seem to have 
              kept some potting skills alive as a result of their close proximity 
              to the active folk/utilitarian ceramic industry at Koishiwara, but 
              significant production by these families had ceased long before, 
              and the increased industrialization of the Japanese ceramics industry 
              prior to World War II resulted in a gradual loss of those skills 
              that had survived.</p>
            <p><b>A Revival in Interest</b></p>
            <p>By the early 1950s the Takatori tradition seemed in danger of dying 
              out. In 1957, however, a female descendant of the main family of 
              Edo period Takatori potters, Takatori Seizan (1908-1982), began 
              taking steps to resurrect her family's potting tradition, building 
              a new kiln at Tsuzumi. At the age of forty-eight she successfully 
              undertook to learn the difficult tasks of her ancestors' profession, 
              including throwing the thin shapes of Takatori, composing glazes 
              and firing a woodburning kiln. Later, she organized and published 
              many of the Edo period documents handed down in her family, including 
              the most complete version of the Takatori rekidai kiroku, in the 
              volume <i>Takatori-ke monjo</i> (Takatori Family Documents, 1979). 
              This publication, combined with archaeological excavations of the 
              earliest Takatori sites in the 1980s, ushered in a new era of interest 
              in Takatori.</p>
            <p><b>Takatori Ware Today</b></p>
            <p>At present, Takatori style kilns exist not only in the western 
              part of Fukuoka city and in Tsuzumi (see entrance to the contemporary 
              Takatori kiln at Tsuzumi, above), but in Koishiwara village and 
              at several locations near the old kilnsites, including Eimanji Takuma 
              and Uchigaso. The most popular style generally has been that of 
              the thin, colorfully glazed wares of Ensh&ucirc; taste fired at 
              Shirahatayama. Recently, however, rougher, more distorted wares 
              such as those in the style of the Uchigaso kiln have begun to find 
              popularity. The total number of workshops mainly producing ceramics 
              in one Takatori style or another does not exceed ten, however, and 
              most production is limited in quantity and often confined to specialty 
              wares such as tea utensils. Despite the fact that Takatori ware 
              is highly admired among specialists for its vessels for tea, it 
              remains unknown even to many ordinary Japanese. Nonetheless, examples 
              of the ware, both historical and contemporary, have found their 
              way into private collections around the world, as well as major 
              museums in Japan, North America, and Europe. Deeper understanding 
              of the role Takatori ware has played in the development of taste 
              in tea wares and other types of vessels cannot help but create a 
              better appreciation of Japan's ceramic art.</p>
