            <p align="left"><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p align="left"> Welcome to Tokoname &quot;Yakimono Sanpomichi&quot; 
              or Pottery Path. The &quot;Yakimono Sanpomichi&quot; is a path which 
              started as a natural tour of the various points of interest in Tokoname 
              in about 1972. This path is filled with old traditional houses, 
              workshops and buildings of great character and interest. It has 
              remained unchanged keeping its pottery-town atmosphere, unique to 
              Tokoname.</p>
            <p align="left"> I'd like to explain a little about the <a href="http://www.japan-net.ne.jp/~tokoname/tokonae1.html"><b>City
              of Tokoname</b></a> before we start walking. Tokoname was already 
              well-known as a pottery town at the end of the 12th century. Tokoname 
              is one of the six historic pottery towns of Japan. The others are: 
              Bizen, Shigaraki, Tamba, Seto and Echizen. They are known as The 
              Six Ancient Kilns of Japan&quot;.</p>
            <p align="left"> The Tokoname kilns were said to be the <a href="http://www.japan-net.ne.jp/~tokoname/tokonae2.html"><b>largest
              and oldest of them all</b></a>. Tokoname took advantage of its proximity 
              to the sea and extended the market throughout Japan by use of ships. 
              A large amount of old Tokoname pottery was found in many places 
              in Japan.</p>
            <p align="left"> You can see the pottery from those days at <a href="http://www.tokoname.or.jp/scan/togeiken.html"><b>The
              Ceramic Art Institute</b></a>. Although it was made more than 900 
              years ago, it is very artistic and shows the dynamic flashings and 
              brightness from natural wood-ash glaze.</p>
            <p align="left"> Tokoname ware has a long history and tradition which 
              dates back from 900 years ago. <a href="tokoname2.html"><b>Redware</b></a>
              was invented in the early 1800s. It developed with the production 
              of teaware like teapots and cups for green tea. Producing ceramic 
              pipes, bowls and jars has made Tokoname City prosperous. In the 
              1900s the mass production was introduced which saw the establishment 
              of production systems and improvement of kilns.<br>
              Nowadays a wide range of ceramics from construction tiles and sanitary 
              ware to table ware, vases and art pottery is produced. The total 
              annual production of the ceramic industry has reached approximately 
              110 billion.</p>
            <p align="left"> We will begin the Pottery Path walk now. This area 
              flourished as the center of the ceramic industry in the early and 
              mid 1900s. They mainly produced ceramic pipes, bowls and jars. There 
              are some factories and potters' studios which are still operating, 
              but the number of them has declined compared with that of its heyday.</p>
            <p align="left"> Before we start, I'd like you to remember some important 
              points. First, when you enter workshops and factories, please say 
              hello to the people to get permission to go in. Always be polite 
              and please don't touch works and goods thoughtlessly at factories 
              and studios. You may handle works and products at stores and galleries, 
              but please use care and hold them with both hands.</p>
