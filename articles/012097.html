              </font></strong></b></font> 
            <P> <STRONG>Josiah Wedgwood</STRONG> was born in Burslem, Staffordshire, 
              England. His father was a potter himself and at the age of fourteen, 
              Wedgwood was apprenticed to his brother Thomas, who was also a potter. 
              Wedgwoods heirs <a href="http://www.wedgwood.com"><b>Josiah Wedgwood 
              &amp; Sons</b></a> still run the business today. 
            <P> Wedgwood soon recognised the potential market that existed for 
              ceramics in England, due to the backwardness of techniques and ideas 
              at the time. He discarded traditional Staffordshire forms and began 
              incorporating elements of 'higher' Rococo and Neo-classical art 
              into his work, creating articles that were to become fashionable 
              amongst the 'high society' of England. 
            <P> His first great success was the perfection of a cream-colored 
              crockery. The chemical composition was actually that of a stoneware 
              clay, but it was fired to an earthenware temperature and lead-glazed, 
              giving it its characteristic creamy yellow color. This cream-colored 
              ware became very popular, especially after Wedgwood was conferred 
              Royal patronage by Queen Charlotte of England, after which the ware 
              was called 'Queen's Ware'. The Cream Ware was often decorated using 
              a then new technique called <STRONG>Transfer Printing</STRONG> (widely 
              used today), which was invented by John Saddler of Liverpool, who 
              collaborated with Wedgwood from 1761 onwards. 
            <P> In 1769, around the time of the rise of neo-classicism in europe, 
              Wedgwood devised a new clay body, which was to be known as 'Black 
              Etruscan' or 'Black Basalt' ware. This was a clay body made from 
              a red iron-bearing clay with additions of manganese-dioxide, which 
              gave it its black color. The formula rendered the clay quite hard 
              and dense after firing and it was possible to give it a highly polished 
              finish. 
            <P> Almost synonymous with the name Wedgwood has become his famous 
              'blue and white' ware or <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.netcentral.co.uk:80/steveb/jasper.html">'Jasper
              Ware'</A></STRONG>. Jasper Ware was made from a clay body invented 
              and tested by Wedgwood himself. It took him several years to come 
              up with the result, which was first introduced in 1774. <STRONG>The 
              Jasper Ware body</STRONG> was a pure white, but could be colored 
              in numerous ways. Usually it was colored a light to medium blue, 
              with pure white bas-relief ornaments added. These would be made 
              in separate molds and carefully attached at the leather-hard stage. 
              There is a long list of items that were made in the Jasper Ware, 
              including cameos, seals, medallions, candlesticks, tea-ware and 
              even busts. 
            <P> Nowadays, authenticating original Wedgwood ware is done with the 
              help of <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.netcentral.co.uk:80/steveb/auth.html">Signature
              Marks</A></STRONG>, which Wedgwood used from as early as 1759. 
            <P> Wedgwood continued to produce ceramics and explore new techniques 
              until his death in 1795.
