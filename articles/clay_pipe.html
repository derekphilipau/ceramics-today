            <p>In June of 2004 I had a wonderful opportunity to work at the Mission 
              Clay pipe factory in Pittsburgh, Kansas. I spent 12 days working 
              inside the plant, carving 12 terracotta sewer pipes, with expert 
              help from the factory workers. These pipes are termed &quot;the 
              largest pipe in the world&quot;. All the pipes have now been fired, 
              without any structural problems, bringing the project to successful 
              completion.</p>
            <p><font size="-2">Fig.1</font><b><a href="images/clay_pipe/Fig1.jpg"><br>
              <img src="images/clay_pipe/thumbs/Fig1.jpg" width="167" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>Carving 
              the Pipes</b><br>
              Work began on Monday, June 14th. It was amazing to see the team 
              at work extruding (&quot;pressing&quot;) the huge pipes, which actually 
              steam from the intense pressures of the hydraulic machinery. Two 
              8-ft pipes and two 12-ft pipes were extruded and delivered by forklift 
              to the designated studio in dryer A1. (Fig.1) A square flue-type 
              pipe, 4 x 4 feet, had been saved in shrink-wrap from the previous 
              week. Two days later, I got another two twelve-foot and two ten-foot 
              pipes before production switched to smaller pipes. Because of production 
              schedules, the work period was tightly scheduled from June 14 - 
              26th. </p>
            <p>Previous experience carving raw industrial pipe at the Gladding, 
              McBean factory in Lincoln, California had taught me to expect a 
              very coarse, gritty clay body. The clay texture changes from sand-in-butter 
              to a dry concrete texture in only eight hours, if left uncovered. 
              It is essential to move rapidly around the pipe, marking the designs, 
              carving the images, and painting areas of color with slips <br>
              <br>
              I use a needle tool to draw directly on the pipe. When extruded, 
              industrial pipe has a smooth, polished skin, which shows any mark 
              dramatically. Next I use a small trimming tool to cut a groove along 
              the outline. The small end of a pear-corer enlarges this groove, 
              at which point the tool is flipped and the outline again carved 
              out. Now the smooth clay of the outlined image is marked out in 
              a wide, shallow groove. It is important that the transition between 
              the deeply carved areas be as smooth as possible.</p>
            <p>Preliminary sketches for the pipes are important when plotting 
              out the sheer scale of a twelve-foot pipe. Designing for a narrow, 
              vertical image led me to consider swimmers, tornados and circus 
              scenes, in order to logically stack the figures above one another 
              on the surface of the pipes.</p>
            <p><font size="-2">Fig.2</font><br>
              <a href="images/clay_pipe/Fig2.jpg"><img src="images/clay_pipe/thumbs/Fig2.jpg" width="124" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a></b>For 
              a large image like the trapeze artist in Circus, I needed to carve 
              deeply around the arms and face. (Fig.2) This presents a special 
              problem, since the clay body used for industrial pipe contains a 
              huge proportion of refractory material, and the pieces range from 
              sand to lumps the size of small marbles. Inevitably these do seem 
              to appear right at the point of fine detail, like an eye or lip. 
            </p>
            <p>I found two solutions for the detailed areas of carving and modeling. 
              One is to add softened clay trimmings to deeply pitted areas. Such 
              areas need to be quite small, however, because of the risk that 
              the added clay will not adhere through the firing. This led me to 
              a new approach. After outlining and preliminary carving, I used 
              a toothed rib, scratching up the surface vigorously, bringing up 
              the finer clay particles. This is followed with a rubber rib, compressing 
              and refining the surface, which reacquires its highly polished, 
              almost burnished look. The rubber rib has to be used with considerable 
              pressure for this to work well. Sliding the edge of the rubber rib 
              along the grooved outline makes a single deep line around the contour 
              of the image, helping create the illusion of depth.</p>
            <p><b>Color and Design</b><br>
              I used slips formulated at <a href="http://www.leslieceramics.com/">Leslie 
              Ceramics</a>, generously donated by John Toki. Four months of testing 
              preceded the project, to check the fit, and making it possible to 
              choose colors which worked well with the fired terracotta of the 
              pipes For the pair of pipes titled Circus, Circus, I used a bright 
              vivid blue that evokes a festival feeling and suggests sky or a 
              big top tent around the acrobats. I had to make a 30-inch brush 
              handle to reach the bells of the tall pipes, even from a scaffold, 
              but had no problems with dripping. Twister is intended to be a colorful 
              melee of forms flying through the air. The images are outlined and 
              carved in shallow relief, with the exposed pipe texture left for 
              contrast </p>

              <img src="images/clay_pipe/thumbs/Fig3.jpg" width="136" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              first two pipes, Made in Kansas, form a collaborative piece including 
              work by factory workers and members of the <a href="http://www.members.cox.net/midwestclay/public_html/index.html">Midwest 
              Clay Artists</a>. I looked at the effects of different tools, textures 
              and brush sizes. Because of the generous amount of underglazes provided, 
              I wanted to use them to maximum advantage. I found alla prima (wet-on-wet) 
              painting to be a wonderful way to create depth in landscape. This 
              expressive method makes it possible to blend the slips on the clay 
              surface, giving a convincing sense of depth and motion to the sky. 
              It is a pleasure to work a large area so vigorously. The technique 
              appears in the sunset image of the dozing fisherman (Fig.3) on Made 
              in Kansas, as well as on Dos Rios, and Splash</p>
            <p><font size="-2">Fig. 4</font><b><a href="images/clay_pipe/Fig4.jpg"><br>
              <img src="images/clay_pipe/thumbs/Fig4.jpg" width="117" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a></b>Dos 
              Rios, a pair of 10-ft pipes, shows life by the river in both Kansas 
              and California. The pipes are intended to form a single piece. It 
              is important that the contrasting landscapes form a unified image 
              when viewed together, so I used string and pins to ensure matching 
              horizon lines, and a three-pronged garden tool to make matching 
              water lines on the front face of the pipes. I spent particular care 
              on the human details of the images; (Fig.4) the scale of the pipes 
              makes this especially important. (Fig.5)</p>

              is not carved or painted at the top, leaving the skin of the clay 
              untouched. (Fig.6) A 10-ft diver, a child in a swimming tube, and 
              a third figure, cannonball diving into the water and holding her 
              nose, comprise the images. Carved waves in an Art Deco style surround 
              each figure, with bubbles floating above them as they splash into 
              the water. This pipe also refers to Kansas clay artist Waylande 
              Gregory, whose work Fountains of the Atom appeared at the 1939 World's

            <p><b>The Factory Setting</b> <br>
              Walking through a working factory means being constantly alert for 
              forklifts with pallets of pipe, as well as other vehicles and busy 
              production areas. The large pipes are so big that human comparison 
              can be quite startling. (Fig 7).</p>
            <p><font size="-2">Fig.7</font><br>
              <a href="images/clay_pipe/Fig7.jpg">
              <img src="images/clay_pipe/thumbs/Fig7.jpg" width="164" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              safety equipment required for the factory includes hardhat, steel-toed 
              boots and jeans, all of which make working in the hot, wet environment 
              unique. I was careful to drink water all day long. During the hot 
              midday, I drank electrolyte solutions to prevent muscle cramps. 
            </p>
            <p>The work site space was about a thousand square feet, in &quot;dryer&quot; 
              A1. The dryer setting is where the industrial pipe is placed after 
              being extruded. It is designed to be very wet. There is a sub floor 
              fifteen feet below the pipe, which can be seen through the welded 
              steel grate of the floor. This floor seems treacherous until you 
              have seen a forklift with a 4000-pound pipe driving across it, then 
              any fears of dropping through it vanish. . </p>
            <p>The sub floor is necessary to maintain the humidity. We hosed it 
              down through the grate, four or more times daily. We were also supplied 
              with a special gauge to monitor humidity and temperature, which 
              should be within 10 degrees of each other at all times</p>
            <p>The factory workers are extremely knowledgeable about the pipe 
              conditions. We received daily visits in dryer A1 to check progress, 
              offer help and encouragement, and enjoyed several visits with family. 
              It was recommended that the pipes be wrapped for even drying, using 
              10 x 25-ft rolls of 2 ml plastic. There was discussion about needing 
              a very slow (28-day) firing schedule after the important, month-long 
              preliminary drying period. A further consideration was the rapid 
              cooling of the kilns, which is inevitable after summer's end. In 
              order to protect the pipes, they were carefully loaded by forklift 
              into the center of the enormous beehive kiln, insulated by the surrounding 
              pipes. All these and many other skilled solutions made possible 
              the successful collaboration of the Mission Clay pipe project. </p>
