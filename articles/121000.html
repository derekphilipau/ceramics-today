          <td> <p> <b><strong><font size="4" color="#274F76">High Bisque, Low Glaze</font></strong></b>
            <p> The 
              normal way for the studio potter to fire ceramics is usually to 
              bisque the wares to somewhere between cone 09 and cone 06 (-- <a href="../cones.html"><b>explanation
              of cone temperatures</b></a>), glaze the work and then fire to the 
              maturation temperature of the clay body and the glaze. This would 
              go for earthenware as well as stoneware. However there is another 
              method to fire ceramics, and that is a technique often used in industry, 
              where the ceramics are bisqued to a higher temperature than the 
              glaze firing. </p>
            <p>This works best with earthenware or midfire clays bodies, as they 
              are still somewhat porous when high fired. This means that they 
              still have the capacity to soak up the glaze. A typical combination 
              might be to bisque to cone 01 and then glaze fire the work to cone 
              06. 
            <p>There are a couple of things that need to be taken into consideration. 
              First of all, the clay should be strong enough for your needs after 
              the bisque firing, as the subsequent lower temperature glaze firing 
              will not further vitrify the clay much, if at all. Secondly, the 
              lower fire glaze should be tested for a good glaze fit. This is 
              not automatically guaranteed and the usual problems of crazing or 
              shivering or pinholing can still occur, so previous testing is paramount. 
              Underglaze decoration can still be done on greenware or bisque. 
            <p>The technique is less suited to stoneware or porcelain although 
              not impossible. The problem is that the higher fired ware has become 
              vitreous, so it won't soak up any glaze. This excludes the normal 
              methods of glazing such as dipping or under normal circumstances 
              spraying. To overcome this problem, the vitrified work needs to 
              be heated with a burner, then a light coat of glaze is sprayed on. 
              The process is repeated until a sufficient layer of glaze has built 
              up. The thickness of the glaze may need to be tested by scratching 
              it with a pin or nail. In this case, it is also recommended to put 
              some gum arabic or CMC into the glaze to stop it brushing of when 
              handling to put in the kiln. In some cases, this technique will 
              be desirable even for stoneware or porcelain, especially when applying 
              glaze to bisque ware somehow influences the decoration, as would 
              be the case with <a href="072798.html"><b>water-soluble metal salts</b></a>.
