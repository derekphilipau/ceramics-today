              <b>Yixing - the Pottery Capital of China and the Teapot Center of 
              the World</b><br>
              Yixing is a city situated on the western side of Lake Taihu, in 
              the southeastern province of Jiangsu, the delta of Yangtze River, 
              and about four hours driving distance from Shanghai. The area is 
              also called "Fish and Rice Countryside of Jiangnan (Southeast of 
              Yangtze River)". It is one of the richest areas of Eastern China. 
              <br>
              <br>
              According to the history source, the ceramic production history 
              can be traced to 7,000 to 8,000 years ago in Yixing area. It started 
              producing celadon ware during the Han and Jin Dynasties, and a kiln 
              site of the Tang Dynasty has been excavated in the area. Today, 
              Yixing ceramics can be divided into five categories, also called 
              the Five Golden Flowers: Zisha, Jing-Tao (white dinner ware), Cai-Tao 
              (multi-colored ceramics), Cave4.jpg" ><a href="images/yixing2005/YXCave4.jpg"><img src="images/yixing2005/YXCave4_s.jpg" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Yixing Cave" align="left" border="0"></a></a> 
              Jun-Tao (also called Jun glazed ware) and celadon. The purple sand 
              teapots of Yixing might be the most well known in the world. <br>
              <br>
              The purple-brownish highly iron content clay is called "Purple Sand" 
              (Zisha). It is mined in the Huang Long (Yellow Dragon) Mountain 
              at Dingshu Town and is mainly made into the unglazed, palm size, 
              stoneware teapots which became well-known in the world since the 
              Ming dynasty (the late 16th century). Yixing city is well known 
              as the "Pottery Capital" of China and the "Teapot Center of the 
              World". <br>
              <br>
              Yixing also attracts tourists with its famous bamboo forest, tea 
              plantations, purple sand and natural caverns (there are over eighty 
              caves in the mountain area).<br>
              <br>
              <b>Transportation to Yixing</b><br>
              There are no airports or train stations in Yixing. Travelers have 
              to take the bus from Shanghai, Wuxi, or Hangzhou to get to Yixing. 
              But, a new train station and highway connecting Wuxi via Yixing 
              to Hangzhou will be completed soon. Yixing can be divided into two 
              main districts: Yixing City and Dingshu Town. Because most of the 
              ceramic-related factories and stores are located in Dingshu Town, 
              your first choice is to find a hotel in here. <br>

The Qian-Shu Dragon Kiln is the last dragon kiln left in this area. The kiln was built on a man-made hilltop. There were more than 10 of these remarkable dragon kilns in the area before World War II. Local people believe this kiln dates back approximately 300 years, and it has been repaired and rebuilt many times.<br>
<br>

clay studios and show rooms, and the second floor is the family living area. Most of 
these buildings are open to the public and exciting to explore.<br>

<b>Yixing Purple Sand Factories</b><br>
In 1954 the Municipality of Yixing organized the United Craft Studios for the benefit of 
local craftsmen. Later the name was changed to the Purple Sand Factory Number One. After 
a few years, the Purple Sand Factories Numbers Two, Three, Four, and Five were founded. 
Traditional craft techniques were taught. Also, many professors were invited to the factories 
to teach aesthetics. Many excellent artists study in the Academy of Arts and Design of 
Tsinghua University (the old name of which was the Central Academy of Arts and Design), 
the Jingdezhen Ceramics Institute, and the Nanjing Art Institute. These ways of educating 
craftsmen contribute to preserving ceramic art in Yixing.<br>

The Jun Glaze Garden Pottery is an important branch in Chinese ceramic history. As far back as the Song Dynasty, the beauty of Jun ware resides in its glaze colors which include Jun blue, Jun red, Jun copper, Jun white, etc., more than thirty colors in all. Among them, the Jun blue glaze is the most precious, with its special effects like star, halo, and flower. It wins its reputation with the blue halo coming out of gray, as brightly colored as the butterfly flower. In Japan, it is called the trepang glaze. The piling-up technique is used as traditional decoration for Jun pottery. The artist uses only his thumbs to scrub, twist, press, and stroke the colored clay on its base, making an impression of relief sculpture.<br>
The Jun pottery products are primarily used in the garden, such as various tables, benches, flower pots, vases, fish jars, and street lamps (some seven meters high). They also produce a complete set of elegant dragon columns and decoration for Chinese traditional architecture.<br>
