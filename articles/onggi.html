                <td> <p>Korean pottery today is still largely produced as it was 
                    in the past. For a practicing potter it provides a living 
                    case study of historical ceramic processes and techniques. 
                    Potter's wheels, kilns, tools and other equipment are still 
                    made as they were in years past. Machinery is too expensive 
                    to warrant its purchase and maintenance relative to the cost 
                    of man power. Glaze materials are still ground from the parent 
                    rock materials using ingenious two-man pounders. Within a 
                    period of six days, two men working full time can only produce 
                    about sixty pounds of pulverized material. No ceramic supply 
                    houses offer ready made equipment or processed materials suitable 
                    for instant use. Immense quantities of wood must be transported, 
                    chopped and split. In the Vi dynasty the proximity of kilns 
                    to forests was more important than to kaolin deposits. Today 
                    the forests-are seriously depleted; special permits are issued 
                    for the purchase and burning of wood. It is an expensive fuel 
                    but less so than either oil or propane which are imported 
                    products. Natural gas does not exist. </p>
                  <p>The complexity of the ceramic process is taken for granted, 
                    as is the necessity for a division of labor. Chopping wood, 
                    mixing and decanting clay, slicing, stacking and firing are 
                    assigned to specialists. The authorship of the pottery when 
                    it emerges from the kiln is diffuse, since it is the result 
                    of the coordinated effort of many hands.</p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p> There are four major categories of ceramics produced in Korea 
              today: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Onggi, or earthenware utensils, used for a variety of purposes, 
                but primarily for the storage of pickled vegetables, bean pastes 
                and soy sauces - staple items of the Korean diet. </li>
              <li>Reproduced Koryo and Vi dynasty forms, for sale primarily to 
                the Japanese market. </li>
              <li>Tea bowls, again for the Japanese market. </li>
              <li>Pottery produced within university ceramic departments, reflecting, 
                in varying degrees, exposure to outside influence. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Of the above categories, onggi is of the greatest interest to the 
              Occidental potter. The techniques and methods used are virtually 
              unknown in the West. The Korean potter is able to produce monumental 
              size jars with a speed that seems incredible when witnessed by a 
              Western potter. The methods of coil, paddle and wheel construction 
              are outside the spectrum of ceramic skills in the West, particularly 
              in terms of speed and size.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/onggi/onggi2.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi2_sm.jpg" width="148" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/onggi/onggi5.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi5_sm.jpg" width="148" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> Because of recent developments in the use of various metals, artificial 
              resins, and the growth of in9ustrial ceramics in Korea there is 
              a danger that the production and use of hand&middot; crafted vessels 
              will die out. Moreover, modern materials and processes may be found 
              to be preferable to onggi ware, which is less durable, heavier and 
              higher in price than mass produced pots. Working against this possibility, 
              however, is the conservative character of Koreans and their firm 
              belief that the taste of kimchi would be adversely affected by storage 
              in anything but onggi ware. On the other hand, the new reforestation 
              laws pose a fundamental danger to the continued firing of onggi 
              kilns. Wood is scarce and expensive and imported oil is more so. 
              There seems to be no solution to the high ecological and financial 
              costs of fuel. Thus, it is difficult to predict the future of onggi 
              pottery in Korea. But, for the present, at least, the Western potter 
              is still able to observe the traditional skills of the Korean potter.

            <p><b>Clay Preparation</b> </p>
            <p><img src="images/onggi/DSC02063.jpg" width="246" height="300" align="left">Beginning 
              in the 1950's, the onggi potters started to adopt a traditional 
              Korean technique of refining clay that had hitherto only been used 
              in the manufacture of high-quality white ware. Thus, the methods 
              described below are essentially the same both for onggi and porcelain 
              ware manufacture. About twenty years ago, some onggi workshops on 
              Kanghwa Island adopted that technique, and its use spread gradually 
              to Kyonggi and South Ch'ungch'ong provinces.</p>
            <p> A field approximately 75' x 75' is used for the drying of clay. 
              At each corner of the field a round hole approximately eight feet 
              in diameter is dug out. These are settling vats. Today they are 
              sometimes lined with cement. A smaller rectangular vat approximately 
              two by four feet is built tangential to each of the circular vats. 
              Small wooden connecting dykes allow water from each settling vat 
              to flow back into the mixing vat as water is needed. Raised earth 
              levies divide the ground between the mixing and settling vats into 
              drying fields. In addition they serve as dry footpaths from which 
              workers are able to remove the dried chunks of clay.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Refining Procedures</b></p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li><b>Drying</b>. The raw clay is dried in order to assure that 
                it will slake more quickly in the refining vat. The clay is scooped 
                up with a &quot;three-men shovel&quot; and piled in a sunny place 
                to dry. It is then spread and evened with a wooden rake or hoe. 
                Lumps of clay are broken with the hoe and large stones are picked 
                out. The clay, in the form of soft shale, does not break or slake 
                easily. The dried clay, broken roughly into lumps no larger than 
                apples, is taken to the refining area in a basket or cart. Often 
                an A-frame is used to carry about two hundred pounds to the mixing 
                vats.</li>
              <li> <b>Mixing and slaking</b>. The clay is dumped from the cart 
                or A-frame into the mixing vat containing water. After the clay 
                has begun to dissolve in the water, it is stirred with a wooden 
                paddle to which is affixed a handle with a cross bar at the end. 
                The clay is levered up and down using the edge of the mixing vat 
                as a fulcrum. The soft shale does not slake easily and a constant 
                up-and-down motion of the paddle is necessary to partially dissolve 
                the clay and produce a watery slip. The mixing process involves 
                long and repetitive labor; women are assigned to this task since 
                they can be paid less. To the Western observer it seems incredible 
                that so much labor is expended on a process that could be accomplished 
                easily and quickly by an electric blunger. </li>
              <li> <b>Screening the clay</b>. The thin slurry thus produced is 
                scooped out with a bucket and poured through a thirty-mesh screen 
                into the second or settling vat. The screening assures that clumps 
                of clay, sand and pebbles do not enter the second vat. When more 
                water is needed to continue the mixing process, that gate of the 
                small dyke is removed. The relatively pure top layer of water 
                from the second vat flows back into the mixing vat. <br>
                By repeated mixing, screening and return water flow the clay in 
                the vat is eventually used up, leaving only stones and sand. These 
                are removed with a shovel; more water and raw clay are added, 
                and the process is begun again. Approximately a week is required 
                to fill the settling tank with thick slurry. When the second vat 
                has been filled with screened clay slip, it is scooped out with 
                buckets and taken to the drying field, using the raised levies 
                as walkways.</li>
              <li> <b>Drying the slip to the plastic stage</b>. The ground of 
                the storage area is first covered with a layer of hemp or cotton 
                cloth about 15' x 15' in order to prevent impurities from the 
                ground getting into the clay and to facilitate removing it when 
                it dries to a plastic stage. The clay slurry is spread on top 
                of the cloth and the moisture in the clay is evaporated by the 
                sun and wind. When the clay has been dried to a plastic stage, 
                it is scored with a small scythe and the chunks approximately 
                12&quot; x 12&quot; x 6&quot; are carried to a cart, in which 
                they are transported to the workshop. </li>
              <li><b>Further preparation of the clay</b>. In the workshop the 
                chunks of clay are stacked to form a rectangular mass approximately 
                six feet in length, four feet in width and four feet high. Water 
                is sprinkled on the clay and it is beaten with a long wooden mallet, 
                first with he head, then with the side, by workers mown as saengjilggun. 
                The clay that has been tacked on the workshop floor is then cut 
                into thin slices about 1/8&quot; in thickness with a scythe-like 
                knife. This part of the second processing is performed by workers 
                known as 'hardy lads&quot; or &quot;clay slaves.&quot; The main 
                reason for slicing the clay is to homogenize the distribution 
                of soft and dry clay. <br>
                <br>
                The &quot;hardy lads&quot; next roll the clay into balls weighing 
                forty or fifty pounds. In some workshops, a sheet of cotton cloth 
                is laid on part of the workshop floor and the balls of clay are 
                put on top of this; in others kaolin is spread directly on the 
                earthen floor.<br>
                <br>
                <div align="center"><a href="images/onggi/onggi1.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi1_sm.jpg" width="179" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/onggi/onggi4.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi4_sm.jpg" width="193" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a></div>
                <br>
                <br>
                The balls of Clay are stacked up until a rectangular mass 10' 
                x 10' x 3', i.e., about two and one half tons, is formed. The 
                clay is always beaten first with the head of the mallet, then 
                with the side of the mallet. The mass of beaten clay is then sliced 
                a second time into balls and, for the second time, pounded. After 
                the second pounding the mass of clay is then cut into chunks using 
                a wooden shovel which is carved monoxylously, i.e., from a single 
                piece of wood. These chunks are turned over to form a new mass 
                which is again pounded and cut with the wooden shovel into about 
                hundred-pound squares of plastic clay. <br>
                <br>
                Clay prepared in this way is as well mixed as by a pugmill. In 
                addition, the pounding of the clay may account for the peculiar 
                wet strength and toughness of onggi clay. Several squares, which 
                will be put to use immediately, are set aside and the rest are 
                covered with a damp cloth or plastic sheeting to keep them from 
                drying. The thick sod walls, heavy thatch roof and small windows 
                of the workshops are deal for retaining the moisture content of 
                these &quot;mountains&quot; of clay. <br>
                <br>
                The squares of clay that have not been covered are taken to a 
                place just beside the potters' wheels where they are cut by wire 
                into oblong shapes about 18&quot; x 3&quot; x 3&quot; weighing 
                some twenty pounds.<br>

                  <p>A &quot;hardy lad&quot; quickly moves one of these oblongs 
                    to a relatively flat area of the earthen floor where he begins 
                    to make lateral throws of the clay, quickly extending its 
                    length to some 36 inches. This bar is slightly twisted to 
                    form a spiral cylinder of clay. The techniques of twisting 
                    the clay bar assures the easy transition from bar form to 
                    a smooth even coil. The coil is next reduced to a diameter 
                    of 1 V2&quot; and extended about 6 feet in length by rolling 
                    it backwards and forwards on the earth floor. A pile of these 
                    coils is laid next to the potter's wheel ready for use.</p></td>

                    to about 16&quot; in diameter and 3&quot; in thickness by 
                    a series of rotations and lateral throws. The disc is placed 
                    next to the potter's wheel. The process is repeated until 
                    a stack of discs are made. </p></td>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Flattening the Disc</b> </p>
            <p>The potter now positions himself at the wheel and rapidly dusts 
              the wooden throwing head with dry kaolin powder. The powder prevents 
              the disc from adhering too strongly to the wheel head and allows 
              the finished pot to be lifted from the wheel. No cutting wire is 
              used. </p>
            <p>Next the potter centers the disc on the wheel head. While slowly 
              turning the wheel in a counterclockwise direction, he quickly beats 
              the clay disc with the pangmangi, or beating stick, which he holds 
              in his right hand. This thoroughly compresses the particles of clay 
              and removes air pockets. The potters place great emphasis on learning 
              this; if it is not done correctly, the bottom will crack either 
              in the drying or firing stage. </p>
            <p><b>Wall Formation - First Stage</b> </p>
            <p>The potter inscribes a circle in the disc to mark off the base 
              size desired; then he revolves the wheel and cuts off the excess 
              clay with a wooden knife. Next comes the task of fashioning the 
              walls of the vessel. At the present time there are three methods 
              of constructing the walls, each differing slightly from the others. 
              The most common are the &quot;coil&quot; method, used in Kyonggi 
              province, and the &quot;spiral coil&quot; method used in Kyongsang 
              province. The third, even more startling to the Westerner, is the 
              &quot;slab&quot; method, used in Cholla province. In this technique, 
              long &quot;slabs&quot; of clay, about three times the diameter of 
              the pot, 8 inches wide and 3/8 inch thick, are set one on top of 
              the other to form the vessel wall. These slabs are constructed in 
              approximately the same fashion as the clay coils except that the 
              bars of clay, rather than being twisted and rolled into coils, are 
              flipped in the air and slapped on the ground to form wide &quot;ribbons&quot; 
              of clay. </p>
            <p>The first stage of wall construction consists of connecting the 
              base of the vessel with the bottom-most part of the vessel wall. 
              This portion of the vessel wall may be fashioned of the excess clay 
              from the disc of the clay used in making the base or it may be constructed 
              of a cylinder of clay made especially for this purpose. A coil of 
              clay approximately three times the diameter of the base is put on 
              the wheel. The wheel is rev91ved slowly and the coil beaten flat. 
              In either case, the flat strip of clay is then attached to the edge 
              of the base. After this has been accomplished a thin coil of clay 
              is taken and pressed along the inner seam between the base and the 
              lower part of the wall. This procedure is done in, order to strengthen 
              the joint between these two pieces of clay. It is executed with 
              amazing skill, the knuckle of the right hand pressing the coil into 
              the joint, the left hand providing exterior support. At the same 
              time the wheel is rotated slowly with a rapid heel action of the 
              left foot a method requiring motor skills entirely unknown in the 
              West.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/onggi/onggi3.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi3_sm.jpg" width="288" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/onggi/onggi8.jpg"><img src="images/onggi/onggi8_sm.jpg" width="256" height="200" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>In the next step the potter takes a coil of clay and attaches it 
              to the lower part of the wall already constructed. The technique 
              used in coil joining involves a coordinated pressure of the left 
              palm on the outside surface of the coil together with a series of 
              half rotations on the right hand exerting a downward and opposing 
              lateral pressure. This is performed with virtuoso speed and skill. 
              The left foot, the toes and ball placed against the pit wall, function 
              as a fulcrum for the heel of the foot to again perform a rapid series 
              of forward motions, moving the wheel forward at a speed coordinated 
              with the work of the hands. The process is repeated until three 
              or four coils have been applied. In Kyongsang Province, where the 
              &quot;spiral coil&quot; method is used, the coil, more than six 
              times the diameter of the pot, drapes over the shoulder of the potter 
              and down his back. He feeds it continuously for two or more revolutions 
              of the wheel before the coil is used up. </p>
            <p><b>Beating Techniques</b> </p>
            <p>The next step involves the use of a wooden anvil, or togae, and 
              a wooden paddle. The potter beats against the inner and outer surfaces 
              of the vessel wall with these two implements while at the same time 
              revolving the wheel with his left foot in a counterclockwise direction. 
              In this way the coils of clay are completely homogenized and the 
              walls are thinned. In addition, the clay is compressed and thus 
              becomes stronger. This completed, the potter takes up two scrapers. 
              The one used as an inside scraper is usually a sea shell, although 
              stiff metal scrapers are also used; the other is an outside wooden 
              scraper which is larger. The latter is held in the right hand and 
              the former in the left and applied to the inner surface. The potter, 
              holding the scrapers rigidly opposed to each other, turns the wheel 
              rapidly, &quot;pulling&quot; at the wheel with his left leg. To 
              maintain this sort of strength in the muscles of the left leg requires 
              constant exercise of these muscles. Sore leg muscles are inevitable 
              if the potter begins to work again after a period of inactivity. 
            </p>
            <p>The next stage is the construction of the mid-section of the wall 
              using the same sequence of coil application, paddling, and scraping. 
              The same sequence is repeated to complete the top section of the 
              vessel. This completed, the potter takes the wooden knife to trim 
              the top edge. He then takes a moistened strip of cloth, the central 
              section of which is laid on the top edge, the rest of the strip 
              falling downwards on the inner and outer surfaces. Holding the strip 
              firmly in both hands he turns the wheel, allowing the cloth to create 
              a thickened lip form. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Final Procedures</b> </p>
            <p>With a shorter and thinner piece of cloth pinched between the fingers 
              of the right hand he creates a raised linear decoration just above 
              and below the &quot;body&quot; of the vessel. He supports the inner 
              wall with his left hand as the wheel turns. The vessel is now completed, 
              save for its removal from the wheel. He then trims the bottom of 
              the vessel with &quot;bottom cutter&quot; or wooden knife, turning 
              the wheel at the same time. For a large pot the potter gets the 
              help of one of the &quot;hardy lads&quot; to lift the vessel from 
              the wheel with a piece of cloth. The cloth, measuring about two 
              by four feet, is wrapped around the vessel. The two men, positioned 
              on opposite sides of the vessel, simultaneously pull upwards on 
              the cloth, hereby lifting the vessel from the wheel. It is hen moved 
              to a special shed called the iongch'im, constructed with thatch 
              roof but without walls, where it is set down. The cloth is removed 
              and the vessel is allowed to dry for several days, depending on 
              temperature and humidity. It should be noted that the method of 
              construction makes it unnecessary to trim the bottom of the vessel; 
              even so, the walls of a pot four feet in height are uniformly thin 
              from top to bottom.</p>
