<H3>EDGE - 9th National Australian Ceramics Conference</H3>




Dateline: 06/28/99 
<p>
<IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T">he EDGE - 9th National Australian Ceramics Conference, organmised by  the <A HREF="http://www.ceramicartswa.asn.au/"><B>Ceramic Arts Association of Western Australia</B></A> is taking place in Perth, Western Australia from July 5th - 8th (4th -7th for the USA), 1999. The Australian National Ceramics Conference is a trienniel affair, i.e. once every three years. While this conference is not being billed as a 'millennium conference', there are plenty of high tech activities apprpritate for the 'end of millennium' happening which warrant a closer look.

The web site states "EDGE will consider questions that relate to Ceramics as we move towards the year
2000." These include an internet video conferencing session, various internet chat sessions, live web cam feed from the conference to the web and daily updates of conference proceedings on the web with images taken by digital camera as well as various discussion panels. Some of the above activities are of course not active yet and links will be posted on the bottom of this page on the day. Please note that US residents can already tune in on the 4th of July, as Australia is a day ahead (12-17 hours, depending on your time zone).
