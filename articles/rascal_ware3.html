            <p align="center"><b>Rascal Ware, Hairy Potter and Biloxi - Chapter 
              3</b></p>
            <p>As you may recall, Junior Bucks, our owner and boss, is something 
              of a do-gooder. In that capacity, he spends a lot of time &#8220;out 
              among &#8216;em&#8221;, as he puts it. So it was in this way that 
              he met and hired one Hairy Potter. And Hairy is. He&#8217;s got 
              a body just like a goddamn bear, except that he shaves his head 
              and neck. He&#8217;s huge, very tan, wears an earring and has the 
              same body fat as a nine-inch hard brick. Surprisingly enough, he 
              speaks with a precise British accent. What are the chances?</p>
            <p>Hairy learned his pottery skills in the penitentiary where he served 
              13 years for commodities fraud. It seems that he had pumped the 
              profit potential of futures in wood and ore and when the bottom 
              fell out of the resale market, his investors sued and won. Hairy 
              insists he&#8217;s innocent and that he was just perfecting a sales 
              strategy he&#8217;d learned from Barf Dark or some other art dealer 
              you never heard of.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore9.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore9.jpg" width="208" height="150" hspace="3" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore10.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore10.jpg" width="211" height="150" hspace="3" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>What Hairy will eventually do at Rascal Ware is not yet certain, 
              but it could be scary. He doesn&#8217;t actually use much glaze. 
              Instead, just like him, his work is covered with hair. We don&#8217;t 
              know where the hair comes from, and it drives our studio dog, Shakespeare, 
              about nuts. Between the two of them, we don&#8217;t have a single 
              drain that really works as it should.</p>
            <p>By December, it was clear that the Rascal Ware Pottery had had 
              a pretty good year and, in lieu of a bonus, Junior said he&#8217;d 
              treat us all to a long weekend in Biloxi, Mississippi. Biloxi, of 
              course, is the home of the late, great George Ohr; no relation. 
              We visited the Ohr Museum, where I left a couple of &#8220;business 
              cards&#8221;. They didn&#8217;t seem amused. Then, with directions 
              from a local potter, we dug some of the clay Ohr may have used less 
              than a mile from his studio. It&#8217;s found along the Tchoutakaofuffa 
              River, pronounced shoot-uh-kuh-buff. The clay is so alkaline it 
              could suck water out of a trailer hitch.</p>
            <p>Some young potters may not even recognize clay as it comes from 
              nature. It is usually nothing like the material that you find in 
              bags, dry or moist. That stuff is milled, air-floated, levigated, 
              blended and maybe pugged. In contrast, clay in its natural state 
              contains large rocks, small animals, sand, roots, grass and, in 
              this case, fishheads.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore11.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore11.jpg" width="203" height="150" hspace="3" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore12.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore12.jpg" width="201" height="150" hspace="3" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>When you stand at the riverbank and dig, time is wonderfully compressed. 
              This site is little changed from Ohr&#8217;s day, 100 years ago&#8230;with 
              the exception of the kudzu and the huge shadow of the local Wal-Mart. 
              Pilcher thinks that finding kudzu and Wal-Mart in the same sentence 
              is worth pondering. But in truth, he&#8217;d ponder a fucking parking 
              ticket if he thought no one was watching. There is something moving 
              about taking clay from a pit that might have been turned into (I 
              know, but I&#8217;m weak) some of the great pottery of the last 
              century. The compression of time creates a palpable connection. 
              We dug enough clay for about a hundred pots and then went looking 
              for Hairy who had long since taken off. Real labor doesn&#8217;t 
              appeal to him. No wonder. That night I had an extremely vivid dream 
              about George Ohr. I won&#8217;t bore you with the details except 
              to say that before it was over, his legendary talent for self-promotion 
              had worked on me. </p>
            <p>We found Hairy at the big casino that has its own collection of 
              Ohr pots and displays them right in the main lobby. Hairy wasn&#8217;t 
              hanging around as he had just met Doncy, a gal from Florida, who 
              had really cleaned up at the crap tables that afternoon. They soon 
              took off together, leaving the casino with just enough money to 
              pay its light bill. The only thing the rest of us cleaned up were 
              our plates from the pork buffet. You have to be careful at those 
              buffets; too much can trigger vivid dreams. You can scar yourself.<br>
