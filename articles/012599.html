      <H3>Picol Passo and the Art of Maiolica in 16th century Italy - Part Two</H3>
      <p> Castel Durante was a natural pottery center by virtue of the clays deposited 
        by the river Metauro, the manner of collection and subsequent processing 
        of which is examined at the beginning of the first book. The potteries 
        had benefited from the direct patronage of the rulers of the Duchy of 
        Urbino during the hundred years preceding Picol Passo's time and painted 
        maiolica was made in addition to the older, traditional clear-glazed and 
        unglazed\utilitarian ware. The interest of Guidobaldo 11, Duke of Urbino 
        for most of Picol Passo's lifetime, in the pottery industry of his fief 
        is well documented. One of his commissions still exists: a set of pharmacy 
        jars, probably mainly of the albarello shape, now in the sanctuary of 
        Santa Casa at Loreto, where 348 of them still exist. 
      <P> Thus we have two reasons emerging for the existence of these workshops, 
        the first of which is the production of cheap and useful objects for local 
        needs. The second is the profit and notoriety to be gained from the production 
        of expensive and exclusive products for the delight of those who could 
        afford them. It is in this second category that we, predictably enough. 
        encounter the interest of notable figures of the time, as it was the fashion 
        of the day for men of privilege to gain some knowledge of many different 
        areas of activity and learning. Picol Passo, citing the example of Cosimo 
        1 de' Medioi, who, beside patronizing scholars and painters....is willing 
        with his own hand....to wield the hammer, there painting, there sculpting, 
        now acting as a carpenter, there working on artillery, often as a founder 
        at the furnaces, experimenting with metals to see if bronze comes out 
        in a hard or soft alloy, With his Own hand to work as a master....*. 
      <P> <IMG SRC="../images/ppasso2.jpg" align="left" hspace="10"> Or, speaking 
        of Fracesco Maria 11 of Urbino..... ' On this Francesco Maria, duke of 
        Urbino, my natural lord and master, has well employed his mind and already 
        made a beginning with great fervor, having appointed in several places 
        of his state certain apartments- in which, as is already seen in Pesaro, 
        there are many workshops of the most excellent arts, such as Clock-makers, 
        very accomplished gold-smiths, painters and sculptors. They are still 
        employed in setting up furnaces and the like: here will be practiced the 
        art of the smith, the art of the carpenter and amongst all the rest will 
        be seen to flourish the art of the potter, already flourishing as it does 
        more than in any other place in Italy...* 
      <P> The workshops of the day would have consisted of a number of people 
        who worked generally in their own areas, as well as a workshop managers 
        and Picol Passo gives an approximation of one foreman or manager, two 
        throwers, two or three painters, one or two kiln-men plus a few general 
        workers, perhaps apprentices. Thus, what we are looking at is a typical 
        light-industry, positioned close to the source of its raw-materials, producing 
        goods for local consumption and limited export, employing people on fixed-wages 
        as well as sub-contracting, owned sometimes by the manager and at others 
        by an individual not directly concerned with the day to day running of 
        the workplace but having a controlling interest by virtue of capital input. 
      <P> Another document which throws some light on such mundane details of 
        day to day work is the book of accounts kept from 1453 to 1496 by Maestro 
        Gentile Fornarni, a painter of pottery in Faenzai. Maestro Gentile received 
        a retaining fee from a certain Maestro Giuglielmo and his sons, in whose 
        workshop, or bottega, he painted vessels at a piecework rate when needs 
        arose. He also painted in several other workshops, and from time to time 
        he painted wooden bridal- coffers and carved images. Maestro Guiglielmo 
        usually had one firing of finished ware every month, sometimes two when 
        a large order was at hand. From August to December 1465 Maestro Gentile 
        painted an average of 669 pieces a month. Maestro Gentile's accounts include 
        the names of a number of painted designs, several of which appear in the 
        Arte del' Vasio. 
      <P> <B>Istoriato</B><BR>
        The painter of maiolica ware, apart from relying on set designs and themes 
        with the addition of material such as armorial crests, flags and lettering 
        also had a rich source of imagery at hand when tackling Istoriato work 
        that depicted figurative and narrative subjects. This was, after all, 
        Renaissance Italy, and many of the painters of maiolica relied on borrowing 
        from the images of the day, often from engravings or woodcuts. This can 
        be seen in this Urbino plate, 1535-40, where the unknown painter has copied 
        from the engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, which itself is copied from 
        a composition by Raphael. The subject is the Plague of Phrygia. Or another 
        example, this time by the 'Castel Durante painter', again after a work 
        of Haimondi's, the 'seated man holding a flute' which in the ceramic has 
        become ' Orpheus charming the beasts'. 
      <P> The period we have been examining here, the early to mid l6th century 
        saw Italian maiolica ware traded and sold in most of the European centers 
        of the day, and, not unnaturally, where their work found a good reception 
        the potters soon followed. From Italy the new movement returned revitalized 
        to Spain. It also spread to Pranoa, to Flanders and on to Holland and 
        England, and finally through Switzerland to Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia 
        and Russia. In time all these places developed recognizable individual 
        styles, and during the l7th century technology was to change to allow 
        the examples of the east, specifically Chinese Ming period ware to be 
        emulated with great accuracy, and for the ware to become very much finer 
        and more precise in nature. 
      <P> But at a certain point, although this ware still carries the name maiolica, 
        it seems to me that in its very refinement it loses some of the qualities 
        of spontaneity and humanity that mark it as one of the great periods in 
        ceramics.
