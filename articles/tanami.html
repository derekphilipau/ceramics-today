              One of <a href="http://www.pippindrysdale.com/"><b>Pippin Drysdale</b></a>&#8217;s 
              &#8216;Boab&#8217; pots sits on my desk at home, the delicate tracery 
              barely able to contain its swelling form. Each morning I look deep 
              into the maroon void of it&#8217;s interior and activate its bell-like 
              tone by tapping the top rim. As I work I look over at its elegant 
              poise as it hovers like a dancer and follow the seismic ripples 
              that run over the surface. It is both a meditative and a perplexing 
              experience. </p>
            <p>Confronting Pippin Drysdale&#8217;s pots is fraught with difficulty. 
              Should you keep your distance and take in the relationships of the 
              various forms, should you move closer in to examine the intricate 
              tracery of lines or is it permissible to loose yourself in those 
              wonderful voids that lure you over their fine rim into a world of 
              intense colour? There is also the desire to touch and know the form 
              more intimately measured against their delicate balancing act and 
              the thought they might topple over. Somewhere between these polarities 
              of seduction and restraint we find our point of contact.</p>
            <p> <a href="images/tanami/Pip2.jpg"><img src="images/tanami/thumbs/Pip2.jpg" width="142" height="213" border="0" align="left"></a>For 
              the past quarter century Drysdale has been refining her forms, her 
              materials and her language to create a unique body of work that 
              is responsive to the landscapes of Australia. Although an urban 
              artist she seeks out places that have a special character or resonance, 
              like the Tanami Desert in central northern Western Australia or 
              the Kimberley Region in the northwest of the State. Once absorbed 
              the colours, sounds, patterns and ambience of the site are carried 
              back to the studio where she patiently re-creates their &#8216;hum&#8217; 
              and &#8216;echo&#8217; in the delicate web of glazes etched into 
              the surfaces of her elegantly shaped forms - lines of sight, of 
              smell, taste and memory.</p>
            <p> Although these lines and forms seem arbitrary and abstract there 
              is a remarkable similarity between the rows of dunes blown into 
              long striations by the wind or the stratified rocks laid down over 
              millennia. Back in the studio the thin lines, sometimes anxious, 
              often flowing, occasionally broken, wrap around, enveloping and 
              defining the simplified ceramic form developed in collaboration 
              with her throwing partner Warrick Palmateer. They are vessels refined 
              to a truncated pod-like form balancing on a small base with lightness 
              and poise. The shape is a carefully wrought synthesis, the result 
              of many hours of deliberation in the studio informed by her empathy 
              with the landscape, that carries information about many aspects 
              of the landscape. </p>
            <p>Working from her studio in the port city of Fremantle, surrounded 
              by the catalogue of her trials and failures, racks of wonderful 
              pots of all colours and sizes that failed her exhausting test of 
              quality, she summons up the character of those magical places in 
              these beautiful forms. Firstly choosing the shapes thrown by Palmateer, 
              then adding the layers of glaze and carefully cutting away with 
              a scalpel through a masking resist to inscribe the tracery that 
              defines and shapes each work. None is similar, each has its own 
              temperament and each speaks with a characteristic cadence and intonation.</p>
            <p> <a href="images/tanami/Pip1.jpg"><img src="images/tanami/thumbs/Pip1.jpg" width="142" height="213" border="0" align="left"></a>Some 
              works set up a dialogue with the desert, others with native flora, 
              still others with the dramatic gorges and chasms that lance down 
              into the earth. They both describe and evoke in a play between representation 
              and abstraction that is never fully resolved, remaining a fluid 
              choice for each new player drawn into their orbit. </p>
            <p>For these viewers another dialogue develops, this one interspersed 
              with silences, creating a space for contemplation and meditation. 
              It is the silence of awe and also of recognition that there is something 
              extraordinary, literally breath taking in front of you, something 
              that needs time before you can fully register its subtlety. This 
              dance with the works takes some time, it is different for each viewer, 
              but then the moment of balance occurs and secrets are revealed. 
            </p>
            <p>&#8216;There are so many subtleties to that womb-like interior, 
              to getting it right and to maintaining that sense of containment 
              and tension&#8217; Pippin Drysdale, &#8216;A Commitment to Clay&#8217; 
              2003</p>
            <p>One of the marvellous secrets in each work is the hollow void saturated 
              in colour that provides an inner radiance, both mesmerising and 
              seductive. In the Boab series that orange glow is so intense it 
              seems to create another light source with the room. In contrast 
              to the mesh of white lines cut into the black skin of the pot it 
              looks ready to detonate, its containment only temporary, the form 
              just strong enough to hold it in, the four forms together looking 
              like reactors whose core might soon explode. The swirling interplay 
              of surface decoration and shape heightening the sense of imminent 
              melt down, the moire patterns of shifting lines making it difficult 
              to fix the image of the group. </p>
            <p>Although her individual vessels when shown together suggest relationships 
              this grouping of forms is relatively new, the close proximity of 
              each setting up new tensions, suggesting new dynamics that give 
              the Boab series an extra charge. </p>
            <p><a href="images/tanami/Pip4.jpg"><img src="images/tanami/thumbs/Pip4.jpg" width="142" height="213" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              Boab Adansonia gregorii, indigenous to the Kimberley region of North 
              Western Australia, is a large spreading tree with branches that 
              radiate from the top of the swollen barrel trunk that soaks up and 
              holds water. The tree is a source of nourishment and sustenance 
              in a harsh environment, also providing food in large woody capsule-like 
              nuts. In Drysdale&#8217;s pots the promise within is evoked by the 
              rich orange interiors while the etched surfaces echo the tradition 
              of Indigenous Australians who decorated the nuts and used them as 
              items of exchange. There is also the resonance of the name captured 
              in the relationship of the forms like a hollow play between two 
              drums and so much more. </p>
            <p>Similarly in Spinifex she evokes the colour and soft, blurred forms 
              of the desert grass found in the sandy soil of Central Australia. 
              Growing in a ball shape, its sharp and thin leaves sprouting outwards, 
              the plants when dislodges roll over the landscape propelled by the 
              wind. Something of that erratic tumbling is captured in the lines 
              Drysdale maps around the vessel while the soft grey green colour 
              shifts and blushes in sections just as the rolling balls of grass 
              allow the red earth to bleed through as they move relentlessly across 
              the landscape. </p>
            <p>The northwest of Western Australia is a remarkable environment 
              it&#8217;s harsh and cruel terrain occasionally providing respite 
              in a gorge or fissure in its dry surface where water collects or 
              bubbles up. In these oases the water is clear and fresh, flowing 
              out and over rocks of the richest red ochre, creating a stinging 
              contrast of colour so intense it is quite literally shocking. In 
              Chasm- MacDonnell Ranges the flow of blue lines around the red form 
              mimics that contrast while the unfathomable void of the blue recreates 
              the depth and intensity of the water pools, so welcome after hours 
              of travel across dry terrain.</p>
            <p> One of the most dramatic features of that northwest Kimberley 
              landscape is the Bungle Bungle Ranges, an extraordinary grouping 
              of ochre and black striped mounds, encased in a skin of silica and 
              algae, that rise up to 600 metres about sea level and spread over 
              the land for kilometers. They are like a huge series of Drysdale&#8217;s 
              pots, upended and dispersing toward the horizon. Her own Bungle 
              Bungle 1 Kununarra vessel encapsulates that sense of inevitable 
              and unstoppable replication, moving out in waves, her stripes both 
              defining the looping hills and rolling in and through them.</p>
            <p> <a href="images/tanami/Pip3.jpg"><img src="images/tanami/thumbs/Pip3.jpg" width="213" height="142" border="0" align="left"></a>Pippin 
              Drysdale&#8217;s latest body of work continues her journey through 
              the landscapes of Western Australia. The seven &#8216;Earth Drawing&#8217; 
              pots on show at <a href="http://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/collect/"><b>CO[ 
              ]ECT 2005</b></a> at the V&amp;A in London explore the visual traces 
              of the wind, of the processes of sedimentary deposit, of weathering 
              and erosion. In &#8216;Earth Drawing 04&#8217; the subtle bleed 
              of the lines echoes the leaching of salt while the soft pulse of 
              colour around the form contrasts with the dramatic reverberation 
              of the extraordinary pink interior that glows like a James Turrell 
              installation. You can almost hear the wind whistling across the 
              surface of the land and smell the astringent aroma of saltbush. 
              Each vessel takes as its inspiration a site, a place, or a visual 
              experience and documents a deeply felt resonance with the land. 
              Through her articulate language of line and colour she delineates 
              each form and saturates each sonorous interior to offer us new insights 
              about the environment and open up a space for this dialogue with 
              the landscape to unfold.</p>
