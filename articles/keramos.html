                  turn, my wheel! Turn round and round<br>
                  Without a pause, without a sound:<br>
                  So spins the flying world away!<br>
                  This clay, well mixed with marl and sand,<br>
                  Follows the motion of my hand;<br>
                  For some must follow, and some command,<br>
                  Though all are made of clay! </p>
                <p>Thus sang the Potter at his task<br>
                  Beneath the blossoming hawthorn-tree,<br>
                  While o'er his features, like a mask,<br>
                  The quilted sunshine and leaf-shade<br>
                  Moved, as the boughs above him swayed,<br>
                  And clothed him, till he seemed to be<br>
                  A figure woven in tapestry,<br>
                  So sumptuously was he arrayed<br>
                  In that magnificent attire<br>
                  Of sable tissue flaked with fire.<br>
                  Like a magician he appeared,<br>
                  A conjurer without book or beard;<br>
                  And while he plied his magic art--<br>
                  For it was magical to me--<br>
                  I stood in silence and apart,<br>
                  And wondered more and more to see<br>
                  That shapeless, lifeless mass of clay<br>
                  Rise up to meet the master's hand,<br>
                  And now contract and now expand,<br>
                  And even his slightest touch obey;<br>
                  While ever in a thoughtful mood<br>
                  He sang his ditty, and at times<br>
                  Whistled a tune between the rhymes,<br>
                  As a melodious interlude. </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! All things must change<br>
                  To something new, to something strange;<br>
                  Nothing that is can pause or stay;<br>
                  The moon will wax, the moon will wane,<br>
                  The mist and cloud will turn to rain,<br>
                  The rain to mist and cloud again,<br>
                  To-morrow be to-day. </p>
                <p>Thus still the Potter sang, and still,<br>
                  By some unconscious act of will,<br>
                  The melody and even the words<br>
                  Were intermingled with my thought<br>
                  As bits of colored thread are caught<br>
                  And woven into nests of birds.<br>
                  And thus to regions far remote,<br>
                  Beyond the ocean's vast expanse,<br>
                  This wizard in the motley coat<br>
                  Transported me on wings of song,<br>
                  And by the northern shores of France<br>
                  Bore me with restless speed along.<br>
                  What land is this that seems to be<br>
                  A mingling of the land and sea?<br>
                  This land of sluices, dikes, and dunes?<br>
                  This water-net, that tessellates<br>
                  The landscape? this unending maze<br>
                  Of gardens, through whose latticed gates<br>
                  The imprisoned pinks and tulips gaze;<br>
                  Where in long summer afternoons<br>
                  The sunshine, softened by the haze,<br>
                  Comes streaming down as through a screen;<br>
                  Where over fields and pastures green<br>
                  The painted ships float high in air,<br>
                  And over all and everywhere<br>
                  The sails of windmills sink and soar<br>
                  Like wings of sea-gulls on the shore? </p>
                <p>What land is this? Yon pretty town<br>
                  Is Delft, with all its wares displayed;<br>
                  The pride, the market-place, the crown<br>
                  And centre of the Potter's trade.<br>
                  See! every house and room is bright<br>
                  With glimmers of reflected light<br>
                  From plates that on the dresser shine;<br>
                  Flagons to foam with Flemish beer,<br>
                  Or sparkle with the Rhenish wine,<br>
                  And pilgrim flasks with fleurs-de-lis,<br>
                  And ships upon a rolling sea,<br>
                  And tankards pewter topped, and queer<br>
                  With comic mask and musketeer!<br>
                  Each hospitable chimney smiles<br>
                  A welcome from its painted tiles;<br>
                  The parlor walls, the chamber floors,<br>
                  The stairways and the corridors,<br>
                  The borders of the garden walks,<br>
                  Are beautiful with fadeless flowers,<br>
                  That never droop in winds or showers,<br>
                  And never wither on their stalks. </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! All life is brief;<br>
                  What now is bud wilt soon be leaf,<br>
                  What now is leaf will soon decay;<br>
                  The wind blows east, the wind blows west;<br>
                  The blue eyes in the robin's nest<br>
                  Will soon have wings and beak and breast,<br>
                  And flutter and fly away. </p>
                <p>Now southward through the air I glide,<br>
                  The song my only pursuivant,<br>
                  And see across the landscape wide<br>
                  The blue Charente, upon whose tide<br>
                  The belfries and the spires of Saintes<br>
                  Ripple and rock from side to side,<br>
                  As, when an earthquake rends its walls,<br>
                  A crumbling city reels and falls. </p>
                <p>Who is it in the suburbs here,<br>
                  This Potter, working with such cheer,<br>
                  In this mean house, this mean attire,<br>
                  His manly features bronzed with fire,<br>
                  Whose figulines and rustic wares<br>
                  Scarce find him bread from day to day?<br>
                  This madman, as the people say,<br>
                  Who breaks his tables and his chairs<br>
                  To feed his furnace fires, nor cares<br>
                  Who goes unfed if they are fed,<br>
                  Nor who may live if they are dead?<br>
                  This alchemist with hollow cheeks<br>
                  And sunken, searching eyes, who seeks,<br>
                  By mingled earths and ores combined<br>
                  With potency of fire, to find<br>
                  Some new enamel, hard and bright,<br>
                  His dream, his passion, his delight? </p>
                <p>O Palissy! within thy breast<br>
                  Burned the hot fever of unrest;<br>
                  Thine was the prophets vision, thine<br>
                  The exultation, the divine<br>
                  Insanity of noble minds,<br>
                  That never falters nor abates,<br>
                  But labors and endures and waits,<br>
                  Till all that it foresees it finds,<br>
                  Or what it cannot find creates! </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! This earthen jar<br>
                  A touch can make, a touch can mar;<br>
                  And shall it to the Potter say,<br>
                  What makest thou. Thou hast no hand?<br>
                  As men who think to understand<br>
                  A world by their Creator planned,<br>
                  Who wiser is than they. </p>
                <p>Still guided by the dreamy song,<br>
                  As in a trance I float along<br>
                  Above the Pyrenean chain,<br>
                  Above the fields and farms of Spain,<br>
                  Above the bright Majorcan isle,<br>
                  That lends its softened name to art,--<br>
                  A spot, a dot upon the chart,<br>
                  Whose little towns, red-roofed with tile,<br>
                  Are ruby-lustred with the light<br>
                  Of blazing furnaces by night,<br>
                  And crowned by day with wreaths of smoke.<br>
                  Then eastward, wafted in my flight<br>
                  On my enchanter's magic cloak,<br>
                  I sail across the Tyrrhene Sea<br>
                  Into the land of Italy,<br>
                  And o'er the windy Apennines,<br>
                  Mantled and musical with pines. </p>
                <p>The palaces, the princely halls,<br>
                  The doors of houses and the walls<br>
                  Of churches and of belfry towers,<br>
                  Cloister and castle, street and mart,<br>
                  Are garlanded and gay with flowers<br>
                  That blossom in the fields of art.<br>
                  Here Gubbio's workshops gleam and glow<br>
                  With brilliant, iridescent dyes,<br>
                  The dazzling whiteness of the snow,<br>
                  The cobalt blue of summer skies;<br>
                  And vase and scutcheon, cup and plate,<br>
                  In perfect finish emulate<br>
                  Faenza, Florence, Pesaro. </p>
                <p>Forth from Urbino's gate there came<br>
                  A youth with the angelic name<br>
                  Of Raphael, in form and face<br>
                  Himself angelic, and divine<br>
                  In arts of color and design.<br>
                  From him Francesco Xanto caught<br>
                  Something of his transcendent grace,<br>
                  And into fictile fabrics wrought<br>
                  Suggestions of the master's thought.<br>
                  Nor less Maestro Giorgio shines<br>
                  With madre-perl and golden lines<br>
                  Of arabesques, and interweaves<br>
                  His birds and fruits and flowers and leaves<br>
                  About some landscape, shaded brown,<br>
                  With olive tints on rock and town.<br>
                  Behold this cup within whose bowl,<br>
                  Upon a ground of deepest blue<br>
                  With yellow-lustred stars o'erlaid,<br>
                  Colors of every tint and hue<br>
                  Mingle in one harmonious whole!<br>
                  With large blue eyes and steadfast gaze,<br>
                  Her yellow hair in net and braid,<br>
                  Necklace and ear-rings all ablaze<br>
                  With golden lustre o'er the glaze,<br>
                  A woman's portrait; on the scroll,<br>
                  Cana, the Beautiful! A name<br>
                  Forgotten save for such brief fame<br>
                  As this memorial can bestow,--<br>
                  A gift some lover long ago<br>
                  Gave with his heart to this fair dame. </p>
                <p>A nobler title to renown<br>
                  Is thine, O pleasant Tuscan town,<br>
                  Seated beside the Arno's stream;<br>
                  For Lucca della Robbia there<br>
                  Created forms so wondrous fair,<br>
                  They made thy sovereignty supreme.<br>
                  These choristers with lips of stone,<br>
                  Whose music is not heard, but seen,<br>
                  Still chant, as from their organ-screen,<br>
                  Their Maker's praise; nor these alone,<br>
                  But the more fragile forms of clay,<br>
                  Hardly less beautiful than they,<br>
                  These saints and angels that adorn<br>
                  The walls of hospitals, and tell<br>
                  The story of good deeds so well<br>
                  That poverty seems less forlorn,<br>
                  And life more like a holiday. </p>
                <p>Here in this old neglected church,<br>
                  That long eludes the traveller's search,<br>
                  Lies the dead bishop on his tomb;<br>
                  Earth upon earth he slumbering lies,<br>
                  Life-like and death-like in the gloom;<br>
                  Garlands of fruit and flowers in bloom<br>
                  And foliage deck his resting place;<br>
                  A shadow in the sightless eyes,<br>
                  A pallor on the patient face,<br>
                  Made perfect by the furnace heat;<br>
                  All earthly passions and desires<br>
                  Burnt out by purgatorial fires;<br>
                  Seeming to say, &quot;Our years are fleet,<br>
                  And to the weary death is sweet.&quot; </p>
                <p>But the most wonderful of all<br>
                  The ornaments on tomb or wall<br>
                  That grace the fair Ausonian shores<br>
                  Are those the faithful earth restores,<br>
                  Near some Apulian town concealed,<br>
                  In vineyard or in harvest field,--<br>
                  Vases and urns and bas-reliefs,<br>
                  Memorials of forgotten griefs,<br>
                  Or records of heroic deeds<br>
                  Of demigods and mighty chiefs:<br>
                  Figures that almost move and speak,<br>
                  And, buried amid mould and weeds,<br>
                  Still in their attitudes attest<br>
                  The presence of the graceful Greek,--<br>
                  Achilles in his armor dressed,<br>
                  Alcides with the Cretan bull,<br>
                  And Aphrodite with her boy,<br>
                  Or lovely Helena of Troy,<br>
                  Still living and still beautiful. </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! 'T is nature's plan<br>
                  The child should grow into the man,<br>
                  The man grow wrinkled, old, and gray;<br>
                  In youth the heart exults and sings,<br>
                  The pulses leap, the feet have wings;<br>
                  In age the cricket chirps, and brings<br>
                  The harvest home of day. </p>
                <p>And now the winds that southward blow,<br>
                  And cool the hot Sicilian isle,<br>
                  Bear me away. I see below<br>
                  The long line of the Libyan Nile,<br>
                  Flooding and feeding the parched land<br>
                  With annual ebb and overflow,<br>
                  A fallen palm whose branches lie<br>
                  Beneath the Abyssinian sky,<br>
                  Whose roots are in Egyptian sands,<br>
                  On either bank huge water-wheels,<br>
                  Belted with jars and dripping weeds,<br>
                  Send forth their melancholy moans,<br>
                  As if, in their gray mantles hid,<br>
                  Dead anchorites of the Thebaid<br>
                  Knelt on the shore and told their beads,<br>
                  Beating their breasts with loud appeals<br>
                  And penitential tears and groans. </p>
                <p>This city, walled and thickly set<br>
                  With glittering mosque and minaret,<br>
                  Is Cairo, in whose gay bazaars<br>
                  The dreaming traveller first inhales<br>
                  The perfume of Arabian gales,<br>
                  And sees the fabulous earthen jars,<br>
                  Huge as were those wherein the maid<br>
                  Morgiana found the Forty Thieves<br>
                  Concealed in midnight ambuscade;<br>
                  And seeing, more than half believes<br>
                  The fascinating tales that run<br>
                  Through all the Thousand Nights and One,<br>
                  Told by the fair Scheherezade. </p>
                <p>More strange and wonderful than these<br>
                  Are the Egyptian deities,<br>
                  Ammonn, and Emeth, and the grand<br>
                  Osiris, holding in his hand<br>
                  The lotus; Isis, crowned and veiled;<br>
                  The sacred Ibis, and the Sphinx;<br>
                  Bracelets with blue enamelled links;<br>
                  The Scarabee in emerald mailed,<br>
                  Or spreading wide his funeral wings;<br>
                  Lamps that perchance their night-watch kept<br>
                  O'er Cleopatra while she slept,--<br>
                  All plundered from the tombs of kings. </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! The human race,<br>
                  Of every tongue, of every place,<br>
                  Caucasian, Coptic, or Malay,<br>
                  All that inhabit this great earth,<br>
                  Whatever be their rank or worth,<br>
                  Are kindred and allied by birth,<br>
                  And made of the same clay. </p>
                <p>O'er desert sands, o'er gulf and bay,<br>
                  O'er Ganges and o'er Himalay,<br>
                  Bird-like I fly, and flying sing,<br>
                  To flowery kingdoms of Cathay,<br>
                  And bird-like poise on balanced wing<br>
                  Above the town of King-te-tching,<br>
                  A burning town, or seeming so,--<br>
                  Three thousand furnaces that glow<br>
                  Incessantly, and fill the air<br>
                  With smoke uprising, gyre on gyre<br>
                  And painted by the lurid glare,<br>
                  Of jets and flashes of red fire. </p>
                <p>As leaves that in the autumn fall,<br>
                  Spotted and veined with various hues,<br>
                  Are swept along the avenues,<br>
                  And lie in heaps by hedge and wall,<br>
                  So from this grove of chimneys whirled<br>
                  To all the markets of the world,<br>
                  These porcelain leaves are wafted on,--<br>
                  Light yellow leaves with spots and stains<br>
                  Of violet and of crimson dye,<br>
                  Or tender azure of a sky<br>
                  Just washed by gentle April rains,<br>
                  And beautiful with celadon. </p>
                <p>Nor less the coarser household wares,--<br>
                  The willow pattern, that we knew<br>
                  In childhood, with its bridge of blue<br>
                  Leading to unknown thoroughfares;<br>
                  The solitary man who stares<br>
                  At the white river flowing through<br>
                  Its arches, the fantastic trees<br>
                  And wild perspective of the view;<br>
                  And intermingled among these<br>
                  The tiles that in our nurseries<br>
                  Filled us with wonder and delight,<br>
                  Or haunted us in dreams at night. </p>
                <p>And yonder by Nankin, behold!<br>
                  The Tower of Porcelain, strange and old,<br>
                  Uplifting to the astonished skies<br>
                  Its ninefold painted balconies,<br>
                  With balustrades of twining leaves,<br>
                  And roofs of tile, beneath whose eaves<br>
                  Hang porcelain bells that all the time<br>
                  Ring with a soft, melodious chime;<br>
                  While the whole fabric is ablaze<br>
                  With varied tints, all fused in one<br>
                  Great mass of color, like a maze<br>
                  Of flowers illumined by the sun. </p>
                <p>Turn, turn, my wheel! What is begun<br>
                  At daybreak must at dark be done,<br>
                  To-morrow will be another day;<br>
                  To-morrow the hot furnace flame<br>
                  Will search the heart and try the frame,<br>
                  And stamp with honor or with shame<br>
                  These vessels made of clay. </p>
                <p>Cradled and rocked in Eastern seas,<br>
                  The islands of the Japanese<br>
                  Beneath me lie; o'er lake and plain<br>
                  The stork, the heron, and the crane<br>
                  Through the clear realms of azure drift,<br>
                  And on the hillside I can see<br>
                  The villages of Imari,<br>
                  Whose thronged and flaming workshops lift<br>
                  Their twisted columns of smoke on high,<br>
                  Cloud cloisters that in ruins lie,<br>
                  With sunshine streaming through each rift,<br>
                  And broken arches of blue sky. </p>
                <p>All the bright flowers that fill the land,<br>
                  Ripple of waves on rock or sand,<br>
                  The snow on Fusiyama's cone,<br>
                  The midnight heaven so thickly sown<br>
                  With constellations of bright stars,<br>
                  The leaves that rustle, the reeds that make<br>
                  A whisper by each stream and lake,<br>
                  The saffron dawn, the sunset red,<br>
                  Are painted on these lovely jars;<br>
                  Again the skylark sings, again<br>
                  The stork, the heron, and the crane<br>
                  Float through the azure overhead,<br>
                  The counterfeit and counterpart<br>
                  Of Nature reproduced in Art. </p>
                <p>Art is the child of Nature; yes,<br>
                  Her darling child, in whom we trace<br>
                  The features of the mother's face,<br>
                  Her aspect and her attitude,<br>
                  All her majestic loveliness<br>
                  Chastened and softened and subdued<br>
                  Into a more attractive grace,<br>
                  And with a human sense imbued.<br>
                  He is the greatest artist, then,<br>
                  Whether of pencil or of pen,<br>
                  Who follows Nature. Never man,<br>
                  As artist or as artisan,<br>
                  Pursuing his own fantasies,<br>
                  Can touch the human heart, or please,<br>
                  Or satisfy our nobler needs,<br>
                  As he who sets his willing feet<br>
                  In Nature's footprints, light and fleet,<br>
                  And follows fearless where she leads. </p>
                <p>Thus mused I on that morn in May,<br>
                  Wrapped in my visions like the Seer,<br>
                  Whose eyes behold not what is near,<br>
                  But only what is far away,<br>
                  When, suddenly sounding peal on peal,<br>
                  The church-bell from the neighboring town<br>
                  Proclaimed the welcome hour of noon.<br>
                  The Potter heard, and stopped his wheel,<br>
                  His apron on the grass threw down,<br>
                  Whistled his quiet little tune,<br>
                  Not overloud nor overlong,<br>
                  And ended thus his simple song: </p>
                <p>Stop, stop, my wheel! Too soon, too soon<br>
                  The noon will be the afternoon,<br>
                  Too soon to-day be yesterday;<br>
                  Behind us in our path we cast<br>
                  The broken potsherds of the past,<br>
                  And all are ground to dust a last,<br>
                  And trodden into clay!<br>
                </p>
