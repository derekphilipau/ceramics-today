              By <a href="http://www.fixpots.com">Jeff Zamek</a> 
            <p><b>Time and Labor</b><br>
              Most potters do not have a true economic sense of the time and labor 
              involved in making pottery. They can suffer from a lack of business 
              training and/or a romantic sense of the single craftsmen turning 
              out much needed ceramic objects. The central economic fact in making 
              handmade pottery is the significant cost of time and labor. It is 
              not uncommon once capital expenditures (kilns, slab rollers, clay 
              mixers, wheels, work tables) labor, fixed costs, variable costs, 
              and other factors are calculated for potters to net only a few dollars 
              per hour. Unfortunately, the cost of production is often hidden 
              by gross sales potters make on their pottery. The true net profit 
              on the pots is often not calculated. Potters not only have to buy 
              the supplies make the pots and fire the kiln, but they then have 
              to figure out how to sell the ware. In short, pottery is a labor-intensive 
              marginal activity producing items for an aesthetically educated 
              but limited market. Potters will always be at an economic disadvantage 
              with the mass produced ware bought by the majority of consumers. 
              An economic system based on mass production, marketing, advertising, 
              and mass consumption is at the opposite extreme from the individual 
              potter who produces, with little access to advertising, one of a 
              kind limited production functional objects. Individual potters do 
              not have the resources or the broad based expertise, organization 
              and personnel to advertise and market their products as do the large 
              ceramic manufacturing companies.</p>
            <p><img src="images/zamek/hand_made_cup.jpg" alt="Hand Made" width="162" height="157" align="left">Of 
              all the errors that can derail and eventually eradicate a pottery 
              business it is the mistake of not calculating the actual cost of 
              labor in producing pots. If a potters labor and time were accurately 
              assessed for making one coffee cup it would cost the potential customer 
              at least $35.00. How can a craftsperson compete with the K mart 
              store &quot;blue light&quot; special coffee cups sold for $1.69? 
              Sooner or later labor costs and their economic fact of life effects 
              on the business will literally wear the potter down due to the constant 
              need of more production to fill orders. The whole situation is magnified 
              greatly if the potter has a high percentage of wholesale orders 
              to fill as the net profit is cut by more than 50%. Placing pottery 
              in stores on a consignment basis, with the hope of selling, is essentially 
              giving the store owner free inventory. Potters are left making pots 
              that require extensive labor and must compete against low cost alternative 
              products for the same customer dollar. In most other industries 
              this situation does not make for a good business model.</p>
            <p><b>Variable Quality Raw Materials</b><br>
              In the world of ceramics there is a constant that affects all manufacturers 
              of functional pottery, which includes professional potters, the 
              ceramic industry, and hobbyists: The only thing consistent about 
              raw materials used in pottery is their inconsistency in quality 
              and subsequent performance. With this in mind let's 
              look at the economic facts concerning raw materials. The process 
              of making pots starts with assembling raw materials either for clay 
              body or glaze formulas. If there is a failure in the quality of 
              raw materials the ensuing pottery does not have much of a chance 
              to be successful. Not only will the potter lose the actual pot to 
              a raw material defect, he will lose the time it took to make the 
              pot, glaze the pot, and the kiln space the pot encompassed during 
              the bisque and glaze firings. Raw materials are a fragile component 
              in the production cycle of making and firing pottery. Large-scale 
              ceramics companies can dictate to the mine quality control parameters 
              for a raw material or clay because they order millions of pounds 
              per year. They also have trained staffs of technical specialists 
              to oversee and correct defects caused by a failure in raw materials. 
              Individual potters or small pottery producing companies are undercapitalized 
              not having the resources for a technical staff and not having the 
              ordering capacity to dictate to the mines the quality of clay they 
              produce. </p>
            <p>All of the economic conditions of small production potters and 
              large ceramics producing organizations have one element in common: 
              supply and demand. What does supply and demand have to do with the 
              clay used in ceramics? Everything. If you are a large-quantity user 
              of Edgar Plastic Kaolin and need millions of pounds per year to, 
              say, make spark plugs (which, in fact, does happen), you could then 
              go to the mines and say: &quot;I need a white, easily pressed, high-temperature, 
              clean-burning clay. It also has to be &quot;guaranteed&quot; to 
              have these properties with every batch to insure quality control 
              over the entire production run. At this point, the management at 
              the mine looks at your large order and agrees on a specification 
              for the clay you want, then sets a price. Everything is fine, the 
              kaolin is delivered to the plant, and spark plugs are produced with 
              no spit outs, iron specks or other defects, which could be caused 
              by a substandard material. Other kaolins are also &quot;guaranteed&quot; 
              as they are used in the manufacturing of paper. Kaolin added to 
              the paper making process produces a white, opaque sheet of paper 
              that does not show a bleed line when written upon.</p>
            <p>Potters do benefit from knowing about this particular situation 
              - meaning one bag of such clay is identical to the next, year after 
              year - and use Edgar Plastic Kaolin with consistent results. Other 
              virtually guaranteed raw materials are Custer feldspar, G-200 feldspar, 
              nepheline syenite, whiting, dolomite, flint, calcined kaolin, Kona 
              F-4 feldspar, magnesium carbonate and lithium carbonate, to name 
              a few. This guarantee of uniformity, chemical composition and quality 
              has not been forced on suppliers of raw materials by potters but 
              by large industrial demands. Potters should simply take advantage 
              of a situation that has been worked out by the large players in 
              the supply and demand market.</p>
            <p><img src="images/zamek/calcium_carbonate.jpg" alt="Calcium Carbonate Tablet" width="216" height="219" align="left">Another 
              raw material commonly used by industry is calcium carbonate. A popular 
              antacid tablet sold over the counter contains as the active ingredient 
              calcium carbonate. Other large users of calcium carbonate in varied 
              industries also use this material as it is found in chalk and pharmaceutical 
              products. The demand for calcium carbonate by large industries &quot;guarantees&quot; 
              a steady uniform supply for potters. In ceramic use whiting (calcium 
              carbonate) supplies calcia oxide to glaze formulas and some low 
              fire clay body formulas. </p>
            <p><img src="images/zamek/blaze_blister.jpg" alt="Blistering" width="211" height="301" align="left">Unfortunately, 
              there is a down side to large industries using raw materials that 
              are also used by potters. It occurs when the industry changes specifications 
              for the material. Suddenly, a favorite clay body melts or bloats. 
              Something in the raw material that the potter would consider a horrible 
              defect might not be considered a defect by a larger user, thus it's 
              allowed into the mine's batch to the large user. An example of a 
              good clay for industry that is sometimes a bad clay for potters 
              is A.P. Green Missouri fireclay. Used mostly in the brick and steel 
              industries, it is a perfectly good fireclay for their products, 
              but watch out for those specks of iron and manganese. They might 
              ruin your best casserole. Why doesn't the mine remove the &quot;impurities&quot; 
              before it ships the clay? Well, those impurities don't matter to 
              the large industrial users. What are a few large specks in a brick? 
              They aren't considered a defect, so why spend money adjusting or 
              refining a clay that is acceptable to 99.9% of the market? Potters 
              will always have a certain amount of difficulty using A.P. Green 
              Missouri fireclay, Hawthorn Bond fireclay, Ocmulgee red clay, Kentucky 
              ball clay (OM 4) and other such variable quality clays. The probability 
              is high that over a given period of time there will be some &quot;shift&quot; 
              in the quality in these clays, which will cause defects for potters. 
              The same raw materials will cause no noticeable defects for the 
              industries that use them in producing their products. </p>
            <p><img src="images/zamek/spark_plug.jpg" alt="Mass Produced Item" width="96" height="252" align="left">Occasionally, 
              a large industrial user of raw materials simply drops them from 
              their inventory or doesn't need them any longer for their products. 
              In such cases the raw material supply still exists in the mine, 
              it's just not profitable for the mine to keep producing the clay 
              for only a few potters. At that point potters will eventually exhaust 
              the supply of material in their studios, or buy a supply of the 
              material from other potters. In time they will have to find a substitute 
              material that will produce the same effects in their clays and glazes. 
              This scenario is a recurrent event in the history of raw materials 
              potters have come to depend on for their formulas. Buckingham feldspar, 
              Kingman feldspar, Oxford feldspar, Albany slip, Michigan slip, Gerstley 
              borate, and countless other raw materials are still in the ground 
              but not available any longer to the small market of potters.</p>
            <p>Individual potters cannot order enough kaolin, or other types of 
              &quot;guaranteed&quot; clays to demand a specific level of quality 
              control from the mines or processing plants. They are forced to 
              accept the raw materials as is, which in many instances means particle 
              size variations, chemical composition deviations, and tramp material 
              contamination. Inconsistent raw materials and the potters inability 
              to change this economic fact are recurrent areas contributing to 
              the loss of product. While ceramic suppliers, as a general policy, 
              have limited liability on the clay they sell, it is the potters 
              who suffer the greater loss. A ceramics supplier will replace &quot;bad&quot; 
              clay but the potter will not be compensated for their time and labor 
              in producing the defective pots caused by sub standard clay. The 
              potter will also not be compensated as a general rule for the damage 
              caused to kiln shelves or other kiln furniture caused by a defective 
              clay or raw material. In many instances the potter must prove that 
              the defect originated in the clay and not in their forming or firing 
              procedures. Regardless, at some point an inconsistent material will 
              cause damage to a whole load of pots causing a major financial loss 
              for the potter who depends on a successful firing for their income.
