              ceramics from thirteen countries out of 245 original entries. Contemporary

              Australia, Canada, USA, Belgium, United Kingdom, China, Israel, 
              Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and South Africa.</p>
            <p>In 2004 the judge for the International Ceramics Award was <a href="http://www.josiewalter.co.uk/"><b>Josie 
              Walter</b></a> from England. Ms Walter, who was present at the opening, 
              is currently a Senior Lecturer in History and Theory of Design, 
              Illustration and Sustainable Design and Practice at the University 
              of Derby and a Visiting Lecturer at the Glas &amp; Keramikskolen, 
              Pa Bornholm, Denmark. She is a regular demonstrator to potters' 
              groups and colleges. She has exhibited in over 50 exhibitions since 
              1979 around the United Kingdom, Europe and Canada. She has also 
              curated various exhibitions that have toured around the United Kingdom 
              and internationally. This includes, most recently, an exhibition 
              called &quot;Pots in the Kitchen&quot; at the Rufford Craft Centre 
              which featured 60 potters from Australia, Canada, America and Europe. 
            </p>
            <p>The winners announced on Friday 27 February 2004 were as follows:</p>
            <p><a href="images/sidney_myer/Yanze_Jiang.jpg"><img src="images/sidney_myer/thumbs/Yanze_Jiang.jpg" alt="Yanze Jiang" width="172" height="120" hspace="6" border="0" align="left"></a><b>The 
              Sidney Myer Fund Premier Award</b><br>
              Yanze Jiang, China, for Teapots on parade</p>
            <p> When talking about this work, the judge, Josie Walter, said, &quot;Slip 
              casting can be a severe technique but not only has Yanze created 
              soft flowing forms in porcelain she has also made each piece individual 
              by impressing as well as adding to the surface to create soft textures 
              enhanced by some lyrical brush decoration. The pieces work well 
              as a group, Yanze mentions an allusion to soldiers on parade, but 
              the teapots also work well as individual pieces.&quot;</p>

              has a strong, personal and environmental significance to the artist
