<H3>The CeramicsWeb</H3>

<P>
<IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T">he <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/ceramicsweb.html"><B>CeramicsWeb</B></A>, from the <A HREF="http://apple.sdsu.edu"><B>San Diego State University</B></A> evolved out of the SDSU Ceramics Gopher, which many of you may know. It is maintained by <A HREF="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/rburkett/www/burkett.html"><B>Richard Burkett</B></A>.
<P>
The CeramicsWeb offers a wealth of information for students and non-students alike. A page on <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/about_classmaterials.html"><B>class materials</B></A> caters for the former, while there are <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/articles.html"><B>articles</B></A> on a number of different topics, information on <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/healthsafety.html"><B>Health &amp; Safety</B></A> and various databases, e.g. the <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/magazine.html"><B>Magazines Database</B></A> or the searchable material analyses database for the latter.
The site also features a <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/ceramics_links.html"><B>links page</B></A> a facility to <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/Userlink/userlinks.html"><B>add links</B></A> of your own.
<P>
A large project at this site is the <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/about_glazebase.html"><B>GlazeBase</B></A> Project, which is establishing a database of glaze recipes. The <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu:591/glazebasesearch.html"><B>database is searchable</B></A>. A <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/glazedatabase.html"><B>ClayArt Glaze Database</B></A> is also available. This is a list of glazes collected from the ClayArt Listserv.
<P>
Many of you will be familiar with the <A HREF="http://art.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/clayart.html"><B>ClayArt Listserv</B></A>, which has been running for many years, and has been fulfilling an invaluable function for hundreds of online ceramic artists. By subscribing to the listserv, you regularly receive submissions from all other members via email.
<P>
Richard Burkett and Joe Molinaro of the <A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/"><B>University of Kentucky</B></A> were fundamental in organising the <A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/Artsource/vce/VCEhome.html"><B>Virtual Ceramics Exhibit</B></A>, the first juried exhibition of ceramics on the Internet. (Read an earlier <A HREF="../library/articles/123096.html"><B>review of the VCE</B></A>.)
<P>
The ceramicsWeb and the former SDSU Ceramics Gopher have been around a long time and have been offering an invaluable service to students and the online clay community. No-one should miss checking out this site!
