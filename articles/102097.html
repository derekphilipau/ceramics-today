<H3>Geometric Abstraction</H3>

<P>Dateline: 10/20/97 
<P> Today, the skills being taught in many ceramics institutions have shifted 
  their focus from a Leach/vessel based tradition to a more post-modern, conceptually 
  oriented ceramics. The distinction between much ceramics and sculpture has blurred. 
  The main difference remaining in the work of many artists is the adherence to 
  the material, an occurance less prevalent in sculptural circles. 
<P> This shift in focus towards the concept has led to the exploration by many 
  ceramic artists of a geometric abstract ceramics, which investigates form and 
  geometry, in many cases combined with the unique surface qualities achievable 
  with the unglazerd surface. The work of <B>Pilar Rojas</B>, winner of the <B>1997 
  CerCon Awards</B> is one such example. Her large unglazed forms are an exploration 
  of geometry and its associations: &quot;Objects that are not exact representations 
  of natural or synthetic forms construct a new world of objects and images that 
  can be suggestive of already existing ones, inviting reflection and contemplation.&quot; 
  From the <B>judge's statement</B>: &quot;The winning entry, <B>'Halved'</B> 
  by Pilar Rojas, uses subtle variations of shape to suggest varied spatial moieties, 
  from stone fruit to bowls. The burnished surface adds a contemplative tone to 
  this exploration.&quot; 
<P> Taking the form of geometric abstraction in ceramics to its extreme is <B>Jan 
  Friedman</B>, whose glazed geometric panels are reminiscent of earlier experiments 
  in the post-painterly abstraction period of the 50's and 60's, eg. Joseph Albers 
  or Ad Reinhardt. 
<P>
Of course these are only a few representaives on the Net, there are those who are involved in geometric abstraction off-line. (I could name half a dozen in my home town without much reflection.) What is the strength or appeal of this type of work? Often a critical analysis will only skim the surface, talking about form, surface qualities, but little about meaning or quality of the work. Perhaps the new holy grail of conceptual art in ceramics needs a closer looking at...
