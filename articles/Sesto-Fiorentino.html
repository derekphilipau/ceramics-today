                    founder of the<br>
                    Doccia porcelain factory.</font></p></td>
                <td width="60%"> <p>In 1737 the Tuscan Marquis <a href="http://www.richardginori1735.com/english/history/marchese_carlo_ginori_a.html"><b>Carlo
                    Ginori</b></a> set up a porcelain factory next to his countryside 
                    residence. Doccia was the name of the place which was located 
                    in the borough of <a href="http://www.comune.sesto-fiorentino.fi.it/index.asp"><b>Sesto 
                    Fiorentino</b></a>, six miles north of Florence, in Italy. 
                    That&#8217;s why Ginori porcelain is often referred to as 
                    Doccia (to be pronounced as &#8216;Dotcha&#8217;).</p>
                  <p>At the time of its foundation only two other European hard-paste 
                    porcelain factories were operating: Meissen in Germany, and 
                    Du Paquier, in Austria. Hard-paste porcelain making was a 
                    recent discovery in Europe and a risky technical and economical 
                    challenge: Carlo Ginori (1702-1757) stands among the pioneers 
                    of this particular kind of ceramic which is even more remarkable 
                    considering that the factory he founded is still active today 
                    under the name <a href="http://www.museodidoccia.it"><b>Richard-Ginori</b></a>. 
                    This significant change in company title dates back to 1896 
                    when, after five generations of Ginori ownership and leadership, 
                    the Doccia factory passed to Richard, a fast-expanding Milanese 
                    ceramic industry. The double name Richard-Ginori reflects 
                    the peculiar coexistence of two different identities in the 
                    same company: the artistic manufactory and the industrial 
                    one.</p></td>

                <td width="40%">In 1950 the original factory site was abandoned 
                  and a new, more rational plant was built in the plain by the 
                  railway, 2 miles away from the old one, which stood at the foot 
                  of the woody Mount Morello. In the old factory neighborhood 
                  the parish church of S.Romolo a Colonnata still hosts an impressive 
                  Ginori painted porcelain altar (1785) which is well worth a 
                  visit. In 1965 the Doccia Museum, once located in the 18th century 
                  part of the old factory, moved to its present location, in purpose-built 
                  premises next to the new plant.</td>

                  collection is a series of late baroque waxes. They are original 
                  18th century casts by the best Florentine sculptors of the time: 
                  Giambattista Foggini and Massimiliano Soldani Benzi. The bronze 
                  versions of these works are scattered in Museums around the 
                  world. <br>
                  Carlo Ginori acquired the wax casts and, in some cases, the 
                  corresponding moulds from the heirs of Foggini and Soldani Benzi 
                  in order to make porcelain sculptures of superb quality.</td>

                    the most highly sought after items produced at Doccia, so 
                    much so that during the peak of production the factory had 
                    its own silversmith&#8217;s laboratory that was dedicated 
                    to assembling the pieces.</p>
                  <p> Being a collector and a cultivated art lover, Carlo Ginori 
                    conceived an original series of snuffboxes which were decorated 
                    with relief portraits of famous men and women after ancient 
                    cameos and carved gems. They were grouped by categories, as

                <td width="60%">The so called stampino or stencil decoration is 
                  one of the most distinctive of Ginori early production. It remained 
                  in vogue throughout the 18th century. The blue and white colour 
                  combination clearly imitated oriental prototypes but the elegant 
                  flower design was definitely European. This type of decoration 
                  was obtained by laying a perforated stencil directly on the 
                  plate, and then applying the colour. This technique allowed 
                  workers who were not expert craftsmen to produce highly impressive 
                  decorations. </td>

                  he planned a renovation that would involve the shapes and decoration

                  posters, publicity, photos and the logos of the various lines 
                  of products. His style is an original and eclectic interpretation 
                  of the international Art D&eacute;co taste. Modern shapes and 
                  patterns are often inspired by Italian cultural and artistic

                  maiolica are only a few of the sources he used to elaborate

            <p>Along the hilly side of the road leading from Florence to Prato 
              there are many Villas overlooking the plain of Sesto Fiorentino. 
              Now the area is densely populated but in the past it was mainly 
              occupied by cultivated fields and Florentines aristocrats, such 
              as Carlo Ginori, loved to build country houses with formal gardens 
              on the nearby hills. Two of them are open to the public: <a href="http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/musei/villacastello/default.asp"><b>Villa
