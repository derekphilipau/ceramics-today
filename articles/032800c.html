      <p><b><strong><font size="4" color="#274F76">Tools 
        and Tool Making for Porcelain<br>
        </font></strong><font color="#274F76">Alistair Whyte describes the procedure 
        he uses for making tools and throwing porcelain</font></b> 
      <p> The tombo measure is cut from bamboo which is light and strong. The 
        crosspiece always has the skin of the bamboo facing down. This is usually 
        the straightest edge and can be made finely. Next the kote is made. I 
        usually cut out a template from light card before transferring the drawing 
        to the timber. Once the shape is cut out, the throwing rib is refined 
        with a sharp carving knife. (I use a Japanese knife that has hardened 
        sandwiched steel made in the same tradition as the samurai swords.) The 
        leading edge must be carved in a shape similar to your finger.&nbsp; Lastly, 
        the hera is made by placing the kote on the thin timber plank of cherry 
        or pear and reproducing the shape a little more fully than the kote. The 
        hera is always slightly larger and is the final shaping tool. It is important 
        that this tool is just the shape you desire, remembering there will be 
        17 percent shrinkage and some slumping in the glaze firing. This tool 
        needs to be finished to a fine knifelike edge and then polished like glass.

        &nbsp; 
      <p>It is important to test the tools to see if they will perform as you 
        want them to do. In the case of a teapot design, until the main body of 
        the teapot is made and is satisfactory, one cannot accurately make the 
        model for the spout and handle. (I usually slipcast handles and spouts 
        so the carved models must be made to fit the dry turned body of the teapot 
        before making the molds.) All my throwing is off the hump and this technique 
        is preferable to make the best use of these tools. You can still use them 
        throwing one piece at a time on the wheel head but you would need to use 
        bats to avoid distortion when removing the pots from the wheel. After 
        centering and opening up the clay, the kote is introduced. Holding it 
        steadily with the left hand, the clay is drawn up over the tool with the 
        right hand. (I find it important to keep my body over the wheel head to 
        give me more control.) The hera is the finishing tool which gives the 
        finished shape and surface to the inside of the piece. Here it is important 
        to understand that you are making to the inside shape. The outside shape 
        is turned later to match the inside surface when the piece is nearly dry. 
        If you are happy with the performance of the tools then, using your tonbo 
        measure, you can begin to reproduce that shape. If not, then it is a case 
        of modifying the shape of the tools slightly and trying again. Tochin 
        are pads that are made from the same porcelain clay to be used as setting 
        pads in the glaze firing to prevent or minimize warping. There are two 
        basic types: those for firing items the right way up and those for firing 
        work on their rims (upside down or fuseyaki). These pads need to be carefully 
        thrown off the hump on the wheel, cut off with the bamboo knife and turned 
        when dry. They do not need to be biscuit fired because there is no shrinkage 
        from dry to biscuit with porcelain. The sizes vary according to the item 
        being made and their shape is also important because they must support 
        the item without collapsing. In this, curved forms are much stronger than 
        straight surfaces. 
      <p>Before placing any wares into the glaze kiln, the foot rims are carefully 
        wiped (I never use wax) and the tochin are adhered with a mixture of PVA 
        glue and calcined alumina. The alumina is to ensure ease of detachment 
        after firing and the PVA is to attach them to assist in ease of kiln placement. 
        Other precautions taken in glaze firing include beating a thin pad of 
        porcelain (hama) which is placed between the tochin and the kiln shelf 
        after being dusted with calcined alumina. In the case of firing fine cups 
        with handles, a pad that has been beaten on an angle is placed under the 
        tochin so that the weight of the handle is offset over the cup. This helps 
        to prevent any warping of the cup. Porcelain is turned in an almost dry 
        state. The best turning tools are those made from tungsten carbide steel 
        because they retain their edge although they need a diamond stone to sharpen 
        them. I use a variety of strap steel and tungsten turning tools. A chuck 
        is made from porcelain on the wheel prior to turning and of a size that 
        the item being turned will fit over comfortably. The chuck is allowed 
        to dry completely and can be used almost indefinitely (when its life is 
        finished it can be recycled). To adhere it to the wheel head, dip its 
        base into a bucket of water and then tap it into center on the moving 
        wheel head. Because I throw off the hump, I have made a gauge to measure 
        the area to be turned from the inverted rim where the foot ring should 
        be. This gauge comprises a wooden base with a sheet of glass on it.&nbsp;
