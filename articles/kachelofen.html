              600 Years of 'Kachelofen' tradition 
            <p><b>Forward</b></p>
            <p>The following text describes the history of the popular central 
              European tile stove or 'Kachelofen', a type of energy-efficient 
              stove found in Austro-Hungary, Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia, Northern 
              Italy and Scandinavia. Tile stoves are less known in Anglo-saxon 
              countries such as the US or Britain, where cast iron stoves became 
              popular in the Victorian age. However, masonry and tile stoves did 
              gain some popularity in the US in the 1970s. The Masonry Heater 
              Association of North America has a homepage at <a href="http://mha-net.org/">http://mha-net.org/</a>.</p>
            <p><b>A History of Traditional Tile Stoves</b></p>
            <p><img src="images/kachelofen/kachelofen3.jpg" alt="Enjoying a hearty breakfast on a cold morning in Austria" width="208" height="209" align="left">Apart 
              from open fireplaces, the tile stove is probably the oldest type 
              of heater. It is certainly the heater with the longest tradition.</p>
            <p>The precursor of today&#8217;s tile stoves was probably the pilework 
              stove of the Bronze Age, around 2,500 BC. This early prototype, 
              which developed in the German and Austrian Alps, consisted of a 
              fireplace, which was built up with stone and loam. Even then, the 
              stones took on the role of retaining the heat.</p>
            <p>The further development of the tile stove also took place in the 
              Alps. Fired clay pots were pressed into the stove&#8217;s main building 
              material of soft loam, in order to increase the heat-radiating surface.</p>
            <p><img src="images/kachelofen/ko4.jpg" alt="A traditional tile stove" width="205" height="205" align="left">The 
              actual tile stove, whose shell is made up solely of tiles, wasn&#8217;t 
              viable before potters developed square tiles with a ridge from the 
              pots they were previously using. This development can be traced 
              back to the 14th century. Since then, the tile stove&#8217;s exterior 
              has followed the styles of the various periods, from Gothic, Renaissance, 
              Baroque, Rococo, Classicism, Biedermeier (a German-Austrian Folk 
              style) and Art Nouveau through to the present day. The tile stove&#8217;s 
              heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries.<br>
              <br>
              <img src="images/kachelofen/kachelofen2.jpg" alt="19th C Postcard 'Bliss in the Corner'" width="178" height="288" align="left">Probably 
              be the oldest existing tile stove, built in a style still being 
              practiced today, is to be found in the Electoral Prince&#8217;s 
              residence in Meran (South Tyrol, northern Italy). It was built in 
              the 15th century. Art historians are of the opinion that the Romans 
              were probably involved in the development of the tile stove. At 
              least the term &quot;caccabus&quot; seems to imply this. A caccabus 
              was a hollow cylinder with an opening on one side. They were lined 
              up in rows and thus formed domes for kilns and other types of ovens. 
              It&#8217;s probable that the German word &#8220;Kachel&#8221;, meaning 
              stove tile, is derived from the word &quot;caccabus&quot;.</p>
            <p>The development of the tile stove progressed logically from pressing 
              individual tiles into the soft loam to the tile shell. People soon 
              realized that the tiles, made by the stove-fitter/potter, offered 
              a suitable surface for artistic decoration. Not only princes, but 
              also peasants now had their tile stoves custom built.</p>
            <p><img src="images/kachelofen/kachelofen_plansicht.jpg" alt="Plan showing energy efficient heating method" width="275" height="224" align="left">These 
              days, stylistic periods can be traced back via the many preserved 
              tile stoves of past centuries.</p>
            <p>Apart from the surface embellishments the tile stove was also developed 
              technically in those periods. Thus tile stoves may be considered 
              traditional, but modern at the same time - traditional because they 
              are built mainly according to tried and tested methods, and modern, 
              because they utilize most sources of energy and heating techniques 
              available to us today.</p>
            <p><img src="images/kachelofen/kachelofen5.jpg" alt="Tile stove with baking compartment" width="214" height="246" align="left">Today, 
              a tile stove could utilize wood, coal, gas or electrical hot water 
              and may even have a separate baking compartment attached, according 
              to individual tastes and ideas.</p>
