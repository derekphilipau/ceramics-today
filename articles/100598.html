<IMG align=left SRC="../images/g_gills.gif" alt="G" border=0>ary Wornell is a diverse ceramic artist from Canada, now living in Finland. His ceramic work fits in well with the Finnish design aesthetic. Based on a high professional standard, much of Finnish design reflects the stark contrasts of the landscape with the use of muted colors and natural materials.
<P>
Wornell worked mainly in <B>porcelain</B> between 1976 - 1986 and with <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary
/Ceramics_tcotta_th.html"><B>terracotta</B></A> between 1986 - 1996. <B>Raku works</B> and <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary
/tile_thumbnails.html"><B>tile design</B></A> compliment these two areas.
<P>
The porcelain works are mostly of a functional nature and range from a <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary
/Porc3.html"><B>crackle glazed vase</B></A> to a <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary
Porc5.html"><B>copper red bowl</B></A>. The more recent terracotta works show more of a Nordic influence, displaying an astute combination of loose geometry and muted color combinations. Of these, <B>'Rocking Box'</B> is my favorite.
<P>
A slightly more complex geometry is displayed in Wornell's <B>Raku pieces</B>, while the colors have been reduced to a simple but effective black and silver combination, giving these works a distinct character. Wornell's <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary
tile_thumbnails.html"><B>tiles</B></A>, made in 1992 for the Japanese Inax Corporation, are also based on geometric patterns, but with an organic influence. Here the colors are dominated by blues and oranges. <A HREF="http://www.softavenue.fi/u/gary/archipel.html"><B>Archipelago</B></A>, a wall piece made up of  120 square terracotta tiles, was exhibited at the artist's 1995 exhibition at the Tammisaari Museum in Finland, which was supported by the British Council.
<P>
Wornell's talents do not stop with his ceramic work. He has been increasingly looking towards the use of other techniques to express himself: <B>oil painting</B>, pastels, <B>photography</B> and <B>digital imaging</B>. His photographs of <B>nordic landscapes</B> are well composed and worth viewing. As with all images on this site, you can first check out thumbnails before deciding on viewing larger files.
<P>
Wornell says that he previously worked exclusively in ceramics, but is now diversifying to express his interests, which are &quot;connected to shelter; dwellings, fortresses, temporary structures and the way we shield and protect ourselves from, as well as expose and subject ourselves to, the harsh physical and mental realities of life; poverty, wealth, aggression and our rapidly changing environment and the way people adapt, reinvent their habitat and themselves according to their circumstances.&quot; 
<P>
Gary has an <A HREF="http://www.mygale.org/08/bearing/Exhibition.html"><B>exhibition coming up</B></A> in Finland, so if you're around, check it out!
