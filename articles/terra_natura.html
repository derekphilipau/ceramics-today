              </font></strong></b>Art critic Uma Nair writes on the status of 
              contemporary Indian ceramics. 
            <p><img src="../images/clickable.gif" width="85" height="54"></p>
            <p> Art is as flighty as the weather. No sooner is an art movement 
              deemed pass&eacute; than the new avant-garde picks it up. In India, specifically in the capital city of Delhi ceramic artists have slaved 
              for years, arduously seeking matter and materiality in the urban 
              chaos in which they live. </p>
            <p>P. Daroz, Kristine Michael, Vineet Kacker, Manisha Bhattacharya and 
              Ela Mukherjee were specifically chosen by me for this debut of a 
              curatorial effort because I was exploring a synergy that would exhibit 
              not only the paths of progression but also the intrinsic diversity 
              in their ability to question and create within the expansion of 
              their own sensibility. </p>
            <p> This was an invitation to Terra Natura, showcasing 5 ceramic artistes 
              together for the first time in terms of a show that seeks to unravel 
              distinctive idioms in the language of ceramics. One of the criticisms 
              about trends in Indian ceramics is that shows have presented Indian 
              ceramic artistes aping the West as well as South East Asia, this 
              show seeks to bring in indigenous Indian elements into the ceramic 
              form, as well as look for quaint and timeless probing in the world 
              of the inner and the outer contexts of ceramics. </p>
            <p>In requesting the artists to create 7-10 works both in the large 
              as well as medium and small formats, I would like to state that 
              the quest in bringing five of them together was to look for a confluence 
              of opposite characteristics, iconic references and enchanting imagery. </p>
            <p>My request then lay on the foundation of a tangential foray into 
              creativity so that the works signify their signature but also reflect 
              ingenuous inspiration. Hence the excitement of having a never seen 
              before postmodern fantasy that harks back to infinite elements from 
              Indian cultural associations was the silent quest of this curatorial 
              venture. While the market is important this show must be viewed 
              for its intensity of purpose and its strength of substance. </p>
            <p>In India, a new generation of artists has emerged with the drive 
              to translate its venerable traditions into a contemporary language. These five ceramic artists have created for themselves a niche of 
              sorts, out of a desire to be different. Their work, sometimes on 
              the wheel, sometimes off it in a sculptural quest as evidenced in 
              the exhibition, seems to belie the ideological opposition between 
              craft and disposable culture. These ceramists embrace a consumable 
              culture with a differential attitude, recalling perhaps the human 
              response as well as history in evaluating and recasting it in ceramic 
              forms that forge not only a cohesive unity but also a wide diversity 
              of cultures from within and without. </p>

            <p><font size="+1"><b> Evocative epochs: P. Daroz</b></font></p>
            <p><a href="images/terra_natura/daroz.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/daroz.jpg" alt="P. Daroz" width="184" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>For 
              Daroz who travels all over the world , has 30 years of experience 
              behind him, and comes back with influences his works move from one 
              phase to another, from ancient cultures, to the creation of ceramic 
              objects that hold a peculiar prestige that culls the best of tradition 
              with the modernist gaze in terms of an erudite explanation. On a 
              visit to Egypt he said: I kept looking at the architectural forms 
              and I wanted to break the aesthetics of what I saw. ' The extant 
              paintings from ancient Greece, that adorned the ceramic vessels 
              got recessed in his inner psyche. </p>
            <p> Daroz exemplifies that entendre as he brings to his works a historic 
              amalgam with the flashback to symbolism and the contemporary trends 
              in glazing and the language of forms. 'The Chinese warriors that 
              he saw at China became the heads of his urn like Aladdin jars that 
              grew in bulbous magnificence. 'I used the tops of the jars to create 
              the figures of the warriors heads, ' says he. I wanted to play with 
              the different architectural elements and it was such a feeling of 
              fragility and fascination combined to go back in time and play with 
              the different forms. </p>
            <p> When objects are designed to be thrown away, there is little encouragement 
              to enjoy their material being. Ceramists like Daroz press the pause 
              button on tangential ability, enabling us to appreciate the subtle 
              forms of clay that get juxtaposed into the elements of historicity. Other than cast his forms, Daroz delicately gives us a porcelain 
              slip. The bisque firing burns away the cardboard and then the work 
              is fired again at a higher temperature. He renders his subject in 
              unique forms, sometimes in varied multiples like the two masked 
              faces. He assembles them into split-face like structures, reintroducing 
              the culture of handwork and the equivocal tenor of tonality. The 
              masked face here in porcelain when lit up harks back to yesteryear. It 
              was a work like this which Daroz recently took for the Beijing Biennale. The porcelain face of the Chinese image is intrinsically a flashback 
              to the past for Daroz, who has always been fascinated by history 
              and culture. </p>
            <p><a href="images/terra_natura/daroz2.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/daroz2.jpg" alt="P. Daroz" width="156" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>&quot;I 
              was amazed at the harmony, the sense of proportion that the Chinese 
              civilisation had so many hundreds of years ago, &quot; Daroz said. 
            </p>
            <p>After his trip to China, he embarked on a series of warrior heads 
              that he used as lids for his huge Aladdin-like urns that he glazed 
              in splendid tones of barium sulphate. </p>
            <p>&quot;The soldiers in terracotta were so fascinating, I thought 
              about them for days. The faces that I created, even the warrior 
              heads have a definite spirituality about them and a vibrancy that 
              holds them in a timeframe, &quot; he said. </p>
            <p>Known for his precision and perfection with glazes, Daroz has worked 
              arduously for 30 years on different forms - both sculptural as well 
              as huge urns and murals. His creations grace numerous corporate 
              foyers and hotels all over the country. </p>
            <p>&quot;Using the timeframe to give a sense of history, bringing 
              it back and forth, has always been an important part of my creation. In my work you will see that I have tried to frame fragility and 
              the potency of power, &quot; he said. </p>
            <p>In the four platter like circular creations, he stencils them with 
              edgy dynamics about delineations in history, far from the noble 
              sentiments espoused by his bearded forebears in the masks. Despite 
              the immediacy of his materials, Daroz's works are the product of 
              painstaking processes of translating the incidental and perfectionist 
              tenor of glazes, the ceramist in him labours intensively to render 
              the 'raw' feel of his understanding of graphics. The use of ceramics 
              as a medium to convey ideas normally seen in images from antiquity 
              gives his work added weight. They add the substance of honesty to 
              what otherwise might seem personal indulgence. </p>
            <p><b><font size="+1">Charismatic Cornucopia: Kristine Michael</font></b></p>
            <p><a href="images/terra_natura/Kristine_Michael.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/Kristine_Michael.jpg" alt="Kristine Michael" width="189" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              writer, author, teacher and sculptress in the art of ceramics, Kristine 
              Michael has at least two decades of empowered works behind her. 
              In this exhibition she wants and claims to be a potter having continuously 
              privileged the clay material and wanting to maintain a relationship 
              with the vital and integral power of the form. She calls a number 
              of her works 'Cornucopia'. </p>
            <p>The series of ceramic works titled 'Cornucopia' emerge out of an 
              earlier engagement with the nurturing aspect of life and nature 
              as she unravels a series, which composed of groups of chrome red 
              and yellow pears and capsicum on striped black and white ceramic 
              pillows. 'My work has moved from the single object in a series to 
              multiple similar objects in an organized placement that has meaning 
              when viewed as a whole. The relations between objects in a space 
              fascinate me, and they then move beyond being mere copies or representations 
              of the natural object'says Kristine. ' Twenty years ago, inspired 
              by the sea and spirals in natural organic forms, I started making 
              shells and small sea creatures. Increasing versatility with the 
              ceramic medium and its vagaries of clay, surface finishes and kilns 
              allowed me to expand the way these objects were made ? through raku, pit firing, salt glazed stoneware, wood fired stoneware, porcelain, coloured clay, maijolica and luster. '</p>
            <p>However, she has become more and more involved as a ceramic sculptor 
              in the materials, growing distant from the initial form of the daily-use 
              object. Kristine entertains a body-to- body relationship with clay; 
              she kneads it, mixes it, folding it intensely again and again in 
              order to capture individual forms, like her 'Lidded vessels' and 
              'Lidded Fruits'</p>
            <p>That play with her intense preoccupation with nature's elements 
              giving us the symbolic sensation of born from the earth. 'Throughout 
              this creative journey, I have maintained a dialogue with my inner 
              self, trying to make sense of life through my art, translating haunting 
              human experiences like a fractured search for meaningful construction 
              with nature's sensory and sensual evidence around me' she adds. </p>
            <p>'The word 'cornucopia' is the end of the horn of plenty ? life's 
              cache which opens into a harvest' she elaborates. 'Today's world 
              has the crass and vulgar along with simplicity and beauty, tawdry 
              glitter lives alongside true gold'. . These forms do not come without 
              fights, twists, conflicts, and even some resistance exerted by the 
              artist against herself and against the material in his quest for 
              unknown territories. Her aim, indeed, is to give birth to forms 
              elaborated on bases, always renewed, and yet, paradoxically, relatively 
              constant. Hence, the name we give them: magnificent matrices from 
              nature. They mainly include fruits and vessels and are put into 
              shape and realized in successive series</p>
            <p>These forms retain the imprint of the folding, torsion and violence 
              exerted, producing embossing, tearing, cracks, grooves and furrows, which contribute to the structure and the texture of the surface. The artist refuses the abstraction of a structure which would evoke 
              the informal or the anti-form as a result of a simple game or in 
              randomly accumulating or piling up matter. </p>
            <p>Preferring the relative objectivity of the link with her initial 
              form, her aim is definitely not to produce variations of a known 
              object but to start her creative process from a guiding line in 
              order to look for a form possessing a framework which will become 
              singular. Hence, the name 'form-objects' we give to these creations. </p>
            <p><b><font size="+1">Capturing Contemplation: Vineet Kacker</font></b></p>
            <p><a href="images/terra_natura/HanumanRemixVessel2web.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/HanumanRemixVessel2web.jpg" width="203" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>Vineet 
              Kacker took Delhi by storm when he held a show that were a series 
              of caskets a few years ago. The contemplative idiom and the freezing 
              of the ritual in the ceramic medium is what remained in one's inner 
              recesses. These works started acquiring further freedom and expressive 
              strength when the artist devised a double-casing technique; he has 
              gradually moved sideways, both at the form level and in his way 
              of leaving the imprint of his hands on the material. In his many 
              sojourns over the monasteries in the North he began creating works 
              that were both monumental in tone as well as smaller elements of 
              play. From Sutra Stones, to Totem Poles to Hanuman Remix Vases his 
              idiom transcended the mundane to capture contemplative moorings 
              within and without. </p>
            <p>'The Sutra stones are inspired by the carved Buddhist Mani stones 
              found in the Himalayas' says Vineet. ' The colours denote the elements-red 
              for fire, ochre for earth, blue for water. The stones, 21&quot; 
              across, are also meant to be actual seats to sit on (and meditate). I like the fact that for most people there is a tension created 
              by the act of putting sacred mantras where one would rest one's 
              behind!' he says in humour. ' The glazes are mostly dry and earthy 
              yet colorful. '</p>
            <p><a href="images/terra_natura/SpiritTotem1web.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/SpiritTotem1web.jpg" width="165" height="250" border="0" align="left"></a>'The 
              Spirit Totem is inspired by wayside shrines' he explains. They become 
              a series of small quaint structures that get dramatic because of 
              the threads he twines around them. Perhaps somewhat intriguing is 
              the way he uses the celadon surfacing to give us another feel of 
              the days of yore. ' I make several smallclay elements from stamps 
              and molds, and then collage them together, reflecting in a sense 
              the incremental way in which street shrines evolve. ' he says. ' 
              The icons themselves are composite ones, the body of one matched 
              with the head of another. I like the idea of using oriental celadon 
              type glazes with very Indian imagery, highlighted with the wrapping 
              of ceremonial Tibetan colored thread. '</p>
            <p>Then he gives us two marvelously mesmeric Hanuman Remix Vases that 
              have juxtaposed images on them that speak evocatively of the intense 
              magic of imagery in the ritual iota of memory. ' The Hanuman Remix 
              Vase as the name suggests uses a composite Hanuman head on a Buddha 
              body- an irreverent take combining two symbols that stand for love(hanuman) 
              and compassion(Buddha)'says Vineet. </p>
            <p>All his pieces are in Stoneware, fired to cone 10 (1300 degrees 
              centigrade) in a gas fired kiln. They made using all different techniques 
              - wheel throwing, hand-building, coiling and molds. </p>
            <p> <font size="+1"><b>Zen Strands: Manisha Bhattacharya</b></font></p>
            <p>The dynamics emerging from Manisha's raku works evokes what Deleuze 
              has called &quot;a muscular conception of the material which generates 
              springs everywhere&quot;; indeed, we gradually feel a greater sensitivity 
              to the quiet energy spread by Manisha up to the point it triggers 
              the feeling we open to a breach in the opaqueness of appearances; 
              she leaves the imprint of the vibration of the muscle torturing 
              the material, and of the gesture involving the whole body while 
              applying the glaze and then peeling it off. This energy infused 
              in matter is so present that we can qualify it as organic reflection 
              of the crackle.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/terra_natura/12a.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/12a.jpg" width="219" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/terra_natura/13a.jpg"><img src="images/terra_natura/thumbs/13a.jpg" width="207" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>'These are Raku fired' says Manisha. 'I first burnish my forms &amp; 
              then get them bisqued. Post bisque a peel-off glaze is applied &amp; 
              Raku'd. . Post firing , the work is reduced . The smoke meanders through 
              the crackled glaze to form the carbon black lines on the pots. Smoke 
              lines can be random or premeditated. Post-reduction the glaze is 
              peeled off. the finished pots don't have a layer of glaze. Sometimes 
              I sand-blast the forms to create an interesting play of smooth &amp; 
              granulated surface texture'</p>
            <p> In the smallest pot in this show a raku fired tensile creation 
              by Manisha we can see the strands of texture that have blended into 
              the smoke. This work has a mystic quality about it. That sculptural 
              strength has also a relationship with flesh, with sensuality, as 
              it seems to spark off a form belonging to a space of desire; the 
              artist manages to convey some of the feelings she experiences while 
              decorating her works in the art of minimalism; in the second series 
              of black and white creations their imprints can be perceived in 
              the stripes and furrows preserved on the surface skin. Furthermore, 
              that plastic strength asserts itself in the force lines present 
              in the artist's structures; it results from an operative mode based 
              on the organization of the force lines that constitute the form-objects. 
              One can see a confrontation at work, a tension between horizontality 
              and verticality. . 'I know what attracts me to these forms but I 
              haven't really named the series' she explains. Basically I am working 
              on making the interior space as interactive as the exterior. These 
              forms welcome the viewer to look in &amp; get sucked down the mysterious 
              alley into the enclosed space of these globulous forms. </p>
            <p>Each piece in Manisha's hands possesses a predominantly horizontal 
              or vertical axis, and yet we can perceive a resistance of the opposite 
              axis in all of them. This work of transversality appears also in 
              the gestural result of the peeling off of the glaze on the surface. Lines, black flat tints, vertical or horizontal according to the 
              piece, run across or down it, but that dominance is always counterbalanced 
              by other lines and flat tints running in the opposite way, which 
              create an opposite tension; as well they contribute to the structure 
              of the tension inherent in the work. Finally, the singular colour 
              of the glaze provides a specific light which renders the space palpable. This light is present through the contrasts between the flat tints 
              of intense blacks, the background most often white with the different 
              variations of hues scattered over the surface. On one same structure, these contrasts produce blocks of colour-lights crossed by ridges 
              which, in turn, yield waves of light. </p>
            <p><b><font size="+1">Inner Strengths: Ela Mukherjee</font></b></p>
            <p>Think of works that bring back reflections of fables like 'The 
              shoemaker and the elves, ' Into the three lobed mahogany toned structures, 
              Ela embellishes a leafy twist that reflects the density of vision 
              in creation. </p>
            <p>'For my works form plays the pivotal role. I largely do hand built 
              ceramics' says Ela. ' Even if I do wheel thrown forms, later I alter 
              them or add hand built forms to them. I usually work in series that 
              is I take up a simple form and explore it in various ways by altering 
              or adding other forms to each of them. It is the form, which decides 
              the use of colour. 'she adds. Her works have a plastic strength about 
              them. </p>
            <p>This plastic strength generates a fermentation, a breathing such 
              as it seems to carry vibrations. Using Paul Klee's idea, what emerges 
              is &quot;an in-between world where one doesn't talk and can't see, but where one works&quot;. Thus, the greater the dimensions of the 
              structures the artist confronts, such as those of the two lit works 
              , the more assertive that strength. </p>
            <p>In addition, the artist has managed to produce a differentiating 
              operative function in each series created as well performing at 
              the levels both of form and of the glaze structuring the surface. She keeps managing to escape into diversions from known territories 
              in her quest for interactions of forms and minimal glaze surfaces. That differentiating operating function acts while maintaining a 
              coherence that allows the singular identity of the work to be recognized. </p>
            <p>'I work in stoneware and fire my works in my gas kiln, says Ela. 'I primarily work with different coloured clay bodies, coloured 
              slips, engobes and pigments. The use of glaze is minimal in my works. If I use it, the glaze is usually matt. Mostly I leave a part of 
              a work unglazed, so the clay body and the matt glaze work in contrast. At times I also incorporate other materials like metal, textile 
              with ceramics. This time apart from using metal, I have also introduced 
              light as a part of my works'. </p>
            <p> Ela successfully achieves those transgressions insofar as she 
              has imposed on herself constraints and lines of research, while 
              allowing a potential of randomness to take place in the effect of 
              fire over the tensions given to form, as well as over the practice 
              of glaze overlapping. Thereby Ela offers us the work of a sculptor 
              endowed with a singular sculptural strength and differentiating 
              operative functions. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="+1"><b> Curator's conclusion:</b></font></p>
            <p>All five ceramists entertain a body-to-body relationship with the 
              glazing process as well as well as the sculptural, their surges 
              contained in different symbolic vats, are applied with the hand 
              or a brush, and also thrown on the structure. This set of gestures 
              implies a dynamics involving the whole body and leaves its mark 
              on the surfaces to produce the effects expected. However, submitting 
              a piece of work to the fire introduces an uncertainty or random 
              factor that is included in the technique used, as revealed by the 
              overlapping of glazes which sometimes may not have been wanted, 
              and by the pouring and dripping of the glazes. </p>
            <p>'The incidental nature of firing is exciting, ' says Daroz. Perhaps 
              after firing, the pieces take on varied hues, maybe a rather pale 
              hue, or a dark one or a smoked one, with variations on the surface 
              that stand out against backgrounds and are scattered with flat intense 
              blacks which contribute to its structures. That varied textural 
              terrain is what excites when the surface is covered with lines, marks or images that appear in the form of multiple strokes and 
              dots produced by the liquid dripping or by salt oxidation. It conveys 
              the feeling of the core of a mineral world, without yet vanishing. </p>
            <p>Besides, following its evolution, this show Terra Natural appears 
              to be more and more animated by flows of energy and forces of differentiation. 
              Sure enough, the artists have acquired a heightened relationship 
              with their clay materials, a greater freedom in their practice of 
              glaze application, a more intense knowledge of the relationships 
              of forms and glazes with fire, but all this cannot entirely account 
              for that work's development. The concepts borrowed both from experience, 
              the sculptural strength, and from the loss of firings, the differentiating 
              operative functions, all shed insights on their works. The processing 
              forms together with the style of glazing seem indeed to have become 
              a forming strength endowed with several features. </p>
            <p>The works in Terra Natura deliver visual excitement. Without the 
              bright colors the consumerist culture usually favours, they focus 
              on structure: line, shape and weight. Distinct rhythms emanate, as 
              varied as Vineet's Buddhist leanings to Ela's earthiness, and the 
              longer you look the more colour you see in the subtle gradations. </p>
            <p>Terra Natura opens onto a serious range of metallic and non metallic 
              tints, many of which look like molten colour , or any number of 
              specially mixed alloys, as well as creamy , ivory tonalities. If Manisha 
              even gets black and white to function like colors, their matte surfaces 
              and unfathomable depths making them as mysterious as any of her 
              other indescribably sensual shades. (In art, black and white ordinarily 
              belong to drawing, which tends toward the clarity of rationality 
              rather than the intuitive ambiguity of color. )</p>
            <p> Gestures celebrate Zen simplicity and colors melt into one another. 
              In some works, bare linen grounds evoke the gritty glee of Russian 
              Constructivism. The dim lit face of Daroz's porcelain makes man 
              look only more liquid and hallucinatory. Kristine has managed to 
              transform the cacophony of clashing colors, competing rhythms and 
              logical contradictions into a spunky symphony of visual pleasures 
              that are exponentially more idiosyncratic, freewheeling and fearless 
              than any one work's internal composition. Terra Natura becomes a 
              quiet celebration of the artistic quest that blends the dynamics 
              of minimalist moorings with the maximal energy of artistic intent.</p>
