                  - In pottery<br>
                  - Coating of welding electrodes<br>
                  - Surface treatment in the metallurgical industry<br>
                  - Barium sulphide is used in the production of certain types 
                  of fluorescent tubes<br>
                  - Barium sulphate is used in medical radiology and in the manufacture 
                  of white pigments (litophone) <br>
                  - Etc. </p>
                <p><b>Exposure:</b></p>
                <p>1 - Environmental:</p>
                <p>Barium naturally occurs at low concentrations in ambient air, 
                  usually &lt; 0.05 &micro;g/m3, but is found at relatively high 
                  concentrations in soils , nearly 500 mg/kg. In fresh surface 
                  water, concentrations may vary from &lt; 5 to 15,000 &micro;g/L. 
                  and it contributes to water hardness. Foodstuffs provide also 
                  barium and the daily human intake has been estimated to be in 
                  the order of 1 mg. </p>
                <p>2 - Industrial:</p>
                <p>The pulmonary route of entry is the most significant in the 
                  industrial setting (see exposure limit recommendations). </p>
                <p>Routes of entry:</p>
                <p>Soluble barium salts are well absorbed by pulmonary and oral 
                  routes of entry. <br>
                  Insoluble salts inhaled and deposited are eliminated only slowly 
                  and can accumulate in the lungs as a result of long - term exposure. 
                  Barium compounds are not reputed to penetrate by skin unless 
                  the cutaneous barrier is broken as in chemical burns; a case 
                  has been described in the relevant medical literature which 
                  had been caused by barium chloride in fusion. </p>
                <p><b>Toxicity:</b></p>
                <p>1 - Solubility:</p>
                <p>The toxicity of barium salts is related largely to their solubility, 
                  which conditions their digestive absorption and bioavailability. 
                  Water and acid soluble salts are very toxic when ingested. </p>
                <p>The carbonate BaCO3 is insoluble in water at neutral pH, it 
                  becomes soluble in acid environments, which is not without consequence 
                  in vivo because of the gastric pH. There would be under this 
                  condition, production of barium chloride BaCl2 from the solubilized 
                  carbonate; barium chloride is one the most toxic of soluble 
                  barium salts. </p>
                <p>2 - Metabolism:</p>
                <p>The biological half - life of barium varies between 2 and 20 
                  hours. Absorbed barium is mainly deposited in bones, which accounts 
                  for 93% of the body burden in man. It is mainly excreted in 
                  feces and a small part (1 to 10%) in urine. </p>
                <p>3 - Exprimental toxicity:</p>
                <p>In the case of barium carbonate, the Lethal Dose Fifty (LD50) 
                  is:<br>
                  - mouse (ingestion): 200 mg/kg,<br>
                  - rat (ingestion): 418 mg/kg, <br>
                  which makes it a very toxic chemical by ingestion. </p>
                <p>Barium stimulates the striated and cardiac muscles. This hyperstimulation 
                  causes arrhythmias, myoclonus, digestive disorders and arterial 
                  hypertension by direct effect on the smooth muscles of the arterial 
                  wall independently of the renin - angiotensin system and catecolamines. 
                </p>
                <p>4 - Acute intoxication by ingestion:</p>
                <p>The lethal dose in man varies, according to barium compounds 
                  involved, between 1 and 15 g. by ingestion. Acute intoxications 
                  are rare and generally due to suicidal attempts with the chloride 
                  or the carbonate. </p>
                <p>Some cases of collective food intoxications were reported, 
                  related to food contamination, and to confusion between carbonate 
                  and barium sulphate at the time of radiological examinations. 
                  Barium carbonate having been substituted accidentally for potato 
                  flour during the preparation of sausages, 144 people were poisoned 
                  in Israel in 1963. Two patients died. </p>
                <p><b>A - Clinical findings:</b></p>
                <p>At the beginning, there are digestive disorders:<br>
                  - diarrhoea, sometimes hemorrhagic,<br>
                  - severe abdominal pain,<br>
                  - nausea and vomiting. </p>
                <p>Initially there is intense asthenia, sometimes accompanied 
                  by:<br>
                  - muscle cramps,<br>
                  - myoclonus,<br>
                  - muscular contractures. </p>
                <p>Later there is:<br>
                  - gradually increasing flaccid paralysis involving the 4 limbs, 
                  the diaphragm, and the pharyngolaryngeal junction, which often 
                  requires to resort to artificial ventilation.<br>
                  - the clinical picture may mimick a rapidly evolving Guillain 
                  - Barr&eacute;’s syndrome <br>
                  - respiratory disorders and rhabdomyolysis were reported.</p>
                <p> Cardiac symptoms and clinical signs dominate the prognosis:<br>
                  - Initially there can be arterial hypertension sometimes followed 
                  by hypotension due to digestive liquid losses (diarrhoea, vomiting).<br>
                  - Disorders of excitability and conduction,<br>
                  - Ventricular tachycardia,<br>
                  - Torsades de pointes (&laquo; twisting of the points &raquo;) 
                  leading sometimes to an unexpected ventricular fibrillation 
                  responsible for the fatal types of the intoxication.</p>
                <p>Renal complications were reported in an exceptional manner:<br>
                  - Acute kidney failure with preserved diuresis,<br>
                  - Opacification of kidneys due to barium precipitation. </p>
                <p>Death occurs by respiratory failure or ventricular fibrillation. 
                </p>
                <p><b>B - Laboratory findings:</b></p>
                <p> - Biological examinations highlight disorders related to water 
                  loss caused by diarrhoea. <br>
                  - Hypokaliemia (low levels of blood potassium) sometimes very 
                  significant with acidosis, is characteristic of the intoxication. 
                  However, initially it can be masked by respiratory acidosis. 
                  <br>
                  - Electrocardiographic changes reflect cardiac effects<br>
                  - When the blood concentration of barium was measured in the 
                  course of acute intoxications, values greater than 100 &micro;g/L 
                  were observed. However, blood concentrations fall quickly during 
                  the first 48 hours to become again lower than 10&micro;g/L. 
                  <br>
                  - As renal clearance of barium is rapid, the duration of the 
                  intoxication lasts 2 to 4 days. </p>
                <p><br>
                  <b>C - Treatment:</b><br>
                  It comprises usual symptomatic measures:</p>
                <p> - Gastric lavage, rehydration and correction of hydroelectrolytic 
                  imbalance.<br>
                  - Oral magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) or sodium sulphate makes 
                  it possible to precipitate soluble barium salts present in the 
                  digestive tract as barium sulphate (insoluble).<br>
                  Perfusion of the same salts by intravenous route could cause 
                  renal complications, by intratubular precipitation of barium.</p>
                <p> - Perfusion of important amounts of potassium is often necessary 
                  to correct hypokaliemia mainly due to disorders of potassium 
                  membrane transfer, which are corrected only by the elimination 
                  of circulating barium.<br>
                  <br>
                  - Treatment of cardiac disorders is symptomatic. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>5 - Pulmonary effects:</p>
                <p>Handling of pulverulent barium sulphate was accompanied, at 
                  the time of already old observations, by benign pneumonias generally 
                  resulting in pulmonary radiological images consisting of nodules 
                  disseminated in both lung fields without clinical symptoms, 
                  nor anomalies of respiratory functional tests, it is barytosis. 
                  <br>
                  It also occurs during significant exposures to lithophone and 
                  barium oxide. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, serious fibrosis was reported among workers 
                  of barium mines because of the presence of crystaline silica 
                  in the ore. </p>
                <p>6 - Local effects:</p>
                <p>Aqueous solutions of barium hydroxide and oxide are strongly 
                  alkaline and can cause significant ocular burns and skin irritation. 
                  The carbonate and the sulphate of barium are irritating to the 
                  mucous membranes of the upper airways, the carbonate can also 
                  be irritating to the skin and the eyes. </p>
                <p>Carcinogenesis:<br>
                  Barium chromate(VI) is the only compound recognized as carcinogenic 
                  in man. </p>
                <p>Mutagenesis:</p>
                <p>Barium chloride dihydrate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium, 
                  nor did it induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal 
                  aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. </p>
                <p>Developmental effects: <br>
                  In a mating trial, no adverse anatomical effects were observed 
                  in the offspring of rats or mice receiving up to 4000 ppm barium 
                  chloride dihydrate in the drinking water, although rat pup weight 
                  was reduced. </p>
                <p>Reproduction:</p>
                <p>In rats and mice receiving up to 4000 ppm barium chloride dihydrate 
                  in the drinking water, reproductive indices were unaffected.</p>
                <p>Exposure limit recommendations:</p>
                <p>The TLV - TWA (ACGIH) for soluble barium salts is 0.5 mg/m3. 
                  The TLV for barium sulphate dust (insoluble) is 10 mg/m3. </p>
                <p><b>Prevention:</b></p>
                <p>Good housekeeping of your studio is important as for any other 
                  chemical. <br>
                  Avoidance of processes generating unnecessary dust is also important.<br>
                  Depending on the severity of exposure, local ventilation should 
                  be used and the aspired air should be vented outside to avoid 
                  producing dust from work tables and the floor.</p>
                <p>Very effective filter masks should be worn if the severity 
                  of exposure justifies it during preparation of glazes and clays. 
                </p>
                <p>It should be forbidden to drink, eat or smoke in the workshop.</p>
                <p>Especially, one should not confuse barium carbonate with table 
                  sugar when preparing coffee.</p>
                <p><b>Medical surveillance:</b></p>
                <p>An electrocardiogram is recommended as part of the periodical 
                  examination of workers exposed to soluble salts. Periodical 
                  urinary and blood mesurements could also be carried out; in 
                  subjects not professionally exposed blood concentrations are 
                  lower than 10 &micro;g/L, and lower than 20&micro;g/L in the 
                  urine. </p>
