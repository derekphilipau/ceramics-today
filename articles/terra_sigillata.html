              artists we seek the defining characteristics of our individual voices 
              and the techniques by which to best express this vision. Technique 
              by itself has little meaning. However, often in the interplay between 
              vision and technique we are able to take steps forward, at one moment 
              pushing technique to stretch our vision, and at another pushing 
              our vision to stretch the technique. Looking back in retrospect,

            <p>There is an exciting and diverse range of possibilities in terra 
              sigillatas and slips fired to high temperatures in a wood kiln. 
              These processes lie somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between 
              the natural ash glazed pots of anagama firings and the beautiful 
              more subtle glazed ware fired in wood kilns. In this article I discuss 
              the technical processes I have been working with in this &#8216;middle 
              range&#8217;, while referencing the personal and artistic issues 
              which have taken me on this course of investigation. Additionally, 
              I will attempt to place these processes within the current woodfiring 
              movement. </p>
            <p>Woodfiring has become increasingly popular in the past 10-15 years. 
              This was witnessed at the 1999 International Woodfire Conference 
              held at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, USA, with many 
              of the progenitors of woodfiring in both the USA and abroad attending. 
              It was a wonderful experience to spend several days discussing woodfiring, 
              making contacts and learning about the pursuits of many fine ceramic 
              artists. What was somewhat puzzling for me at the conference was 
              the dominant aesthetic focus on heavy ash build up as typical in 
              a classic anagama firing. However, beginning with the opening address 
              by Louise Cort, there was a call for discussion and exchange of 
              information on glazed woodfired pots and by the fourth day of the 
              conference the &#8216;Decorative Treatments: Slips and Glazes&#8217; 
              panel served as a catalyst for informal discussions on other woodfiring 
              decorative processes and were a welcome counter balance to the preponderance 
              of ash glazed pots. </p>
            <p><img src="images/willoughby3.jpg" width="169" height="236" align="left">It 
              is quite natural that with increased popularity a movement such 
              as woodfiring becomes identified with a predominate focus. This 
              phenomenon is a catalyst for growth but can be somewhat misleading. 
              There are many other areas of exploration taking place in woodfiring 
              and with time I am confident that we will see an increase in the 
              written and visual documentation of these processes. This phenomenon 
              is reminiscent of the high fire reduction pots which swept this 
              country in the late &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s which with time expanded 
              into a wide variety of high-fire options. In retrospect such an 
              initially narrow focus was a part of the catalyst for change within 
              the ceramics movement in the US and abroad, contributing to the 
              vitality, growth and expansion of the studio ceramics movement. 
              Perhaps, with woodfiring, we are in the early stages of a change 
              which with time will gain a new historical significance not yet 
              fully comprehended. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Several concurrent issues sparked my interest in woodfiring. First, 
              I was searching for a firing process in which wet to dry surfaces 
              were equally pleasing and appealing to the touch, where the clay, 
              slips and glaze could all be a part of the surface of a piece and 
              have a tactile appeal. Secondly, I wanted greater involvement in 
              the firing process. I believe this has been a quest to develop an 
              understanding of the primary elements in making pots: clay, air, 
              water and fire. Fire transforms, fire is ritual, fire is a vital 
              and irreversible part of the process of making ceramics and I was 
              separated from it through the use of electric and gas kilns. There 
              is irony for me in the fact that wood has always been a part of 
              my life but only in the past 10 years have I become attuned to the 
              importance of wood in firing my pots. As a child and teenager I 
              was cutting wood for heat and now I have a wood stove in my home. 
              When I light a fire each wintry night the scent sends me back to 
              my most recent woodfiring and to my early childhood experiences 
              and thoughts of transformation and change.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/willoughby5.jpg" width="319" height="126"> 
            </p>
            <p>Before coming to woodfiring, I had worked extensively with slips 
              in high temperature, mid range, and most recently, earthenware, 
              firing in both electric and gas kilns. Processes I was working with 
              included slip-trailing, multiple layering of slips and paper resist. 
              I was applying slips on leather-hard clay because I liked the integration 
              and interaction between the clay and slip that was possible when 
              both were pliable, including carving through the slip into the clay 
              and scraping the clay up into the slip(s). This process of making 
              and immediately decorating work requires intense concentration and 
              focus, and the timing of slip application on the leather-hard clay 
              is critical (clear glazes are applied later to bring out the color 
              in the slips). As I began woodfiring I wanted to simplify my slip 
              application methods and also take the pressure off having to decorate 
              the work at the time it was made. I was ready for a shift in my 
              studio rhythms. Adjusting my slip recipes, I began decorating on 
              bone-dry greenware. This allowed me to fill my studio with pots 
              and then focus on their surface treatment. The adjusted slips for 
              bone-dry clay application held and I was off and running in my first 
              firing of woodfired pots, combining a clay wash to enhance flashing, 
              painted slips, slip trailing and glazes. </p>
            <p>The aspect of this decorating I did not like was brushing and painting 
              slips on the bone-dry pots. In the application of the slips there 
              was a chalky quality in contrast to the natural flow of slips on 
              leatherhard clay. Additionally, slip trailing across a painted slip 
              often ended with a clogged slip trailer. Just when I was about to 
              begin experimenting with additions to the slip recipe to improve 
              the methods for brushing and painting, I took another turn. On my 
              previous earthenware pieces I had begun working with terra sigillata 
              on areas of the pieces where I wanted color and a satin surface. 
              I was attracted to the working qualities of terra sigillatas, how 
              they paint on greenware, as well as the fired sheen so unique to 
              terra sigillata. Why not try terra sigillata in high fire? With 
              my first stroke of terra sigillata on a bone-dry greenware porcelain 
              pot I knew this was going to work. </p>
            <p><img src="images/willoughby4.jpg" width="224" height="139" align="left">I 
              have two methods for preparing terra sigillatas. The first is to 
              mix a large batch of OM #4 Ball Clay and, after settling, ladle 
              off the water on top and then pour off the fine-particled terra 
              sigillata. With one or two cup quantities of this base sigillata 
              I mix high temperature Mason Stains (see formulas). My other approach 
              is to mix colored terra sigillatas using different clays and adding 
              oxides. After leaving it to settle for several days, ladle off the 
              water and pour off the fine-particled terra sigillata. Depending 
              upon the oxides used it is sometimes a good idea to ball mill the 
              mix before decanting to eliminate streaking and spotting from the 
              oxides in the sigillata. Both methods result in terra sigillatas 
              that high-fire to a rich tactile surface, somewhere between a slip 
              and a glaze. The possibilities of color are endless. In applying 
              terra sigillata, I use both smaller paint brushes and sponge brushes. 
              It is important to apply the sigillata with a firm, distinct stroke, 
              returning to overlay where necessary. At the same time I don&#8217;t 
              belabor the application, being careful not to build up too heavy 
              a thickness. Remember, we are applying a wet sigillata to a dry 
              (greenware) pot and to achieve a strong adhesion the sigillata cannot 
              be too thick or it will have trouble holding on to the clay once 
              it dries. On top of the terra sigillatas I often use slip-trailing 
              to create a series of lines, outlines, symbols, marks, etc. These 
              colored slips are slip-trailed on the clay, on a wash over the clay 
              and on terra sigillata. Because of the fine particle character of 
              terra sigillata, slip trailing moves smoothly across the sigillata 
              surface. </p>
            <p>As an artist I can&#8217;t resist decorating on a three dimensional 
              surface. I look forward to the exploration and risk involved in 
              finding the right drawing, pattern or mark(s) for the right form. 
              Some forms dictate a minimum of decoration and other forms reach 
              out for multiple images, patterns or marks. Additionally, there 
              are often multiple solutions to the same form and it is in the dynamic 
              interaction and relationship between form selection and surface 
              treatment where we find our individual expression. The strongest 
              pots bring these two components of form and surface treatment together 
              in a unification unique to the creator ? influenced and affected 
              by time and place, and the materials, forming methods and firing 
              processes used. The range of decorating processes I use in woodfiring 
              work well individually and together. I have created pots with only 
              a wash and glaze, pots with only terra sigillatas and slip, and 
              pots which include a wash, terra sigillatas, slips and glaze. In 
              surface treatment there is opportunity for a simple, direct statement 
              and the opportunity to develop a more complex multiple layered effect. 
            </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/willoughby6.jpg" width="171" height="212" hspace="3"> 
            </p>
            <p>I have been firing my pots in kilns which are based on the noborigama 
              kiln design. My interest and pursuit of woodfiring is directly connected 
              to the emergence of noborigama style kilns in the US. Any type of 
              woodfiring is labor intensive, but these kilns are efficient, suitable 
              for firing in several days or one day. They have an ability to be 
              both responsive and forgiving, the atmosphere can be heavily reduced, 
              neutral or oxidized. As I become familiar with the unique nature 
              of the kiln and each chamber, I stack the pots according to the 
              desired effect sought, considering hotter and cooler locations, 
              heavier and lighter ash build-up, heavier to lighter reduction locations 
              (in a reduction firing) or neutral to oxidizing locations (in a 
              neutral firing). With an interest in color and the use of specific 
              clays, washes, slips, terra sigillatas and glazes, the firing atmosphere 
              becomes an important consideration. Color is influenced and affected 
              by reduction, neutral firing and oxidation. Along with understanding 
              these atmospheres to affect color, an important part of woodfiring 
              is learning to work with the natural flame paths which deliver ash 
              to the pots and create flashing on the sides of pots. This &#8216;mark 
              of the fire&#8217; speaks of the cycles of nature and of transformation. 
              Flashing and ash build-up across washes, terra sigillatas, slips 
              and glazes can evoke a multi-dimensional world. </p>
            <p>Woodfiring includes a broad range of surface treatments from natural 
              ash glazing to washes, terra sigillatas and slips to classical glazes. 
              Within this realm there is incredible variety to the processes and 
              techniques which can be explored, and through this exploration gain 
              knowledge of oneself and the world in which we live. </p>
