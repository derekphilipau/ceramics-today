              <DT><B><U>Absorption :</U></B> 
              <DD>&nbsp; 
              <DT>Inorganic lead is absorbed only by the respiratory and digestive 
                tracts, except for metallic lead, which can penetrate the skin 
                in a negligible way.

              <DT><B>I-Lead Toxicokinetics : </B> 
              <DD>&nbsp; 
              <DT><U>A- Pulmonary absorption :</U> 
              <DT>1-Pulmonary absorption of lead depends on the size of particles; 
                a small proportion of particles of size greater than 0,5 &#181;m 
                is retained at the pulmonary level. The retention of particles 
                having a diameter smaller than 0,5 &#181;m is inversely proportional 
                to their size. 
              <DT>2-Pulmonary absorption also depends on respiratory frequency. 
              <DT>3- The pulmonary deposition rate of lead present in the air 
                is approximately 30 to 50%. 
              <DT>4- Lead which penetrates deeply into the lungs is almost completely 
                absorbed. The rest of lead particles which are found in the higher 
                parts of the respiratory tract, are directed towards the gastro-intestinal 
                system where they are ingested. 
              <DT>5-Lead does not accumulate in the respiratory tract. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><U>B-Gastrointestinal absorption :</U> 
              <DT>1-Gastrointestinal absorption of lead varies according to the 
                physiological state of the individual (fast, age) and the type 
                of lead compound ingested. Thus, the rate of absorption may vary 
                in the fasting adult from 5-15 % to 60-80 %. It is approximately 
                30 to 50 % in the child. 
              <DT>2-Absorption is influenced by the size of the ingested particles 
                (the smallest being better absorbed). 
              <DT>3-Absorption of lead, which takes place in the duodenal region 
                of the small intestine, seems to occur by a saturable mechanism. 
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <DT><U>C-Distribution :</U> 
              <DD>&nbsp;
              <DT>1-Independently from the route of absorption, absorpbed lead 
                passes into the blood circulation where more than 90 % finds itself 
                bound to erythrocytes (it is fixed especially inside the cell 
                rather than on the membrane). The remainder diffuses into the 
                serum. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>2-Studies undertaken in man indicate that absorbed lead is distributed 
                primarily in 3 compartments: the first compartment is blood, the 
                second is made up of soft tissues (central and peripheral nervous 
                systems, liver, kidneys and muscles) and the third one is composed 
                of bone tissue. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>a-Several researchers have proposed refinements to this kinetic 
                model, it has thus been proposed to subdivide the blood compartment 
                into 4 in order to better take into account lead kinetics in the 
                plasma and in the erythrocytes. It is also proposed to subdivide 
                the bone compartment into 2 in order to better reflect the speed 
                of turnover and bone tissue metabolism. 
              <DT>b-Thereafter a model was proposed taking into account the soft 
                tissues with which the exchanges are fast and those with which 
                they are slow. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><U>D-Metabolism :</U> 
              <DT>Lead is not metabolized in the body. 
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <DT><U>E-Excretion :</U> 
              <DT>1- Ingested lead that is not absorbed is directly excreted in 
                the feces. 
              <DT>2-Nearly 80 % of the absorbed lead is eliminated by the urinary 
                tract, approximately 16 % is eliminated via the bile and the remainder 
                is eliminated in the saliva, sweat, hair and nails.There are significant 
                inter-individual variations in the capacity of lead elimination. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><U>F-Half-life :</U> 
              <DT>1-In the adult, blood lead half-life is approximately 1 month. 
              <DT>2-The half-life in soft tissues (such as central and peripheral 
                nervous systems, the liver, kidneys and muscles) is approximately 
                40 to 60 days. 
              <DT>3-The half-life in the bone compartment is approximately 20 
                to 30 years 
              <DT>4-The whole body lead half-life depends on the body burden, 
                which itself is related to the duration of exposure of workers. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><B>II-Interaction :</B>
              <dd><B></B>&nbsp;</dd>
              <DT>Lead toxicokinetics and toxicological effects can be affected 
                by interactions with certain essential elements and nutriments: 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>A-The administration of calcium and phosphorus, at concentrations 
                which can be found in an average meal, decreases lead gastrointestinal 
                absorption by a factor of 6 in fasting adults. 
              <DT>B-It would also seem that the daily intake of food fibers, thiamin 
                and iron lowers blood lead level (BLL) in exposed workers. 
              <DT>C-Lead absorption is reduced by a calcium or zinc intake, probably 
                by a competitive mechanism at the intestinal level. 
              <DT>D-Lead absorption is enhanced by the intake of food high in 
                fat. 
              <DD>&nbsp;
              <DT><B>III-Acute Intoxication :</B> 
              <DD>&nbsp;
              <DT>Acute intoxication is rare in the work environment. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>The inhalation of significant lead amounts can cause digestive 
                disorders (vomiting, epigastric and abdominal pain, diarrhoea 
                and black stools), renal disorders, hemolytic anemia, neurological 
                disorders (encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension, convulsive 
                coma). 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><B>IV-Chronic Intoxication :</B> 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>A-The effects of lead intoxication in man are the same whatever 
                the route of entry into the body. They are generally described 
                in terms of internal dose (amounts of lead in the blood ) rather 
                than in terms of ambient level of 
              <DT>exposure (mg/m&#179; or ppm). 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>B-One of the first symptoms of lead exposure is the appearance 
                of digestive disorders. 
              <DT>This results in colics (intense abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting), 
                constipation, anorexia and a loss of weight. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>C-Articular and muscular pains in the extremities are also reported. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>D- A blue coloured line has been observed on the gingival tissues 
                of people exposed to significant lead concentrations. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>E-Lead exerts certain blood effects. It induces anemia (caused 
                by a reduction in the lifespan of red cells and by a fall of the 
                synthesis of heme by enzymatic inhibition). It also involves an 
                increased production of abnormal erythrocytes. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>F-Lead has effects on the nervous system thus being able to 
                cause encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. 
              <DT>The first symptoms of encephalopathy can appear in the weeks 
                following initial exposure to lead; these are irritability, lassitude, 
                loss of appetite, reduction in the attention,headaches, jerked 
                movements of the eyes, hallucinations, a deterioration of the 
                cognitive functions (reduction in the performance in certain psychometric 
                tests like, for example, eye-hand coordination, skills of verbal 
                reasoning, memory, etc). 
              <DT>Symptoms may worsen, sometimes abruptly, and one can observe 
                delirium, convulsions, paralysis, coma and death. Peripheral neuropathy 
                can result in muscular tremors, weakness of the upper limbs and 
                paraesthesias of the lower limbs (pins and needles, tingling). 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>G-Workers exposed to lead present an increased risk of chronic 
                nephrotoxicity. 
              <DT>The lead levels which can cause such an effect seem to be a 
                function of the duration of exposure. A review of several studies 
                seems to indicate that lead can cause nephropathy at blood lead 
                levels as low as 1,93 &#181;mol/l. 
              <DT>Certain toxic effects are reversible whereas others are not. 
                A recent study suggests that the exposure to low lead levels can 
                cause renal problems in middle-age and old age men. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>H-Some studies suggest that there is a weak positive correlation 
                between blood lead level (BLL) and an increase in blood pressure. 
                However, it is currently premature to draw conclusions on this 
                subject. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>I-There is some evidence that high lead doses could be responsible

              <DT>Main measures are as follows: 
              <DD>&nbsp;
              <DT>A-Work organization : 
              <DT>Operations involving a hazard of lead exposure should not be 
                dispersed in the factory, but on the contrary, put together. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>B-Ventilation : 
              <DT>Primarily, local aspiration systems at the place of generation 
                of lead dusts, fumes and vapors. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>C-General cleanliness of workstations : 
              <DT>Regular washing with water to avoid accumulation of lead dust. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>D-Sanitary equipment : 
              <DT>To allow for adequate personal hygiene: sinks, showers, different 
                lockers for work and town clothes, refectory away from workstations. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>E- Regular evaluation of lead concentration in the air : 
              <DT>It must be done at the workstation. Since in the industrial 
                settings, the main route of entry is the respiratory tract, the 
                mesurement of lead in the air allows to estimate the exposure 
                hazard. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>F-Personal protection : 
              <DT>1-A respiratory protection apparatus should be worn if the concentration 
                in the work environment is greater than the VEMP (0,15 filter 
                mg/m&#179;) 
              <DT>Masks: they must be regularly cleaned and filters replaced. 
              <DT>&nbsp;2-Personal hygiene: nobody should smoke nor eat in workshops. 
                One must also incite workers to wash their hands regularly and 
                to use shower/baths after each working day. Working clothes will 
                not be carried home. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><B>II- Medical Methods :</B> 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>A-Pre-employment medical examination : 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>Subjects suffering from anemia, kidney diseases; pregnant or 
                breast-feeding women, should be kept away from lead exposure. 
                According to Cramer (1966), alcoholism would make workers more 
                sensitive to the toxic action of lead. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>B-Periodical examination : 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>It is necessary to seek and recognize the signs of lead impregnation 
                and the first symptoms and clinical signs of lead poisoning, and 
                to prescribe the biological tests cited above such as BLL and 
                ZPP. 
              <DT>In the case of chronic intoxication, tests for kidney function 
                can also be indicated. 
              <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
              <DT>In the USA, the Action Level (AL) is .03 mg/m3 of air. The general 
                industry standard requires that all employees exposed to or above 
                the AL for more than 30 days per year take part in a medical surveillance 
                program provided by the employer, regardless of whether respiratory 
                protection is used. Routine measurements of BLL and ZPP supplement 
                the information provided by air lead measurements to guide prevention 
                efforts. 
              <DD>&nbsp;
              <DT>C-Medical Evaluations : 
              <DT>1-General industry standard : 
              <DT>a- A medical examination must be undergone by all the candidates 
                for employment where an exposure to lead higher than the AL during 
                more than 30 days per year is encountered. This examination must 
                comprise a clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. 
              <DT>-Clinical Evaluation :General and lead-specific history and 
                physical examination with special attention to hematological, 
                neurological, (central and peripheral ), pulmonary, cardiovascular, 
                gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, renal, and reproductive systems.Medical 
                clearance to wear respirator, if used, applies to all categories. 
              <DT>-Laboratory Testing: it must include BLL, ZPP, blood count with 
                blood smear, urea and plasma creatinine , complete urinalysis. 
                A sperm analysis or pregnancy test could be made if requested 
                by the employee, and any other test the physician deems necessary. 
              <DT>-Periodicity: it will be necessary to repeat BLL and ZPP measurements 
                every 6 months. 
              <DT>b- When the last BLL was = or &gt; 1.93 &#181;mol/L. but lower 
                than the threshold recommended to carry out Medical Removal Protection. 
              <DT>-Clinical Evaluation: complete evaluation as described above, 
                annually. 
              <DT>-Laboratory Testing : complete lab panel if not done within 
                last 12 months (see above). Repeat BLL and ZPP every two (2) months 
                until two (2) consecutive BLLs are &lt; 1.93 &#181;mol/L. 
              <DT>c- When a single BLL is = or &gt; 2.896 &#181;mol/L. or when 
                the average of the last three (3) BLLs, or of all the BLLs of 
                the previous six (6) months are = or &gt; than 2.413 &#181;mol/L. 
                (whichever covers a longer time period), Medical Removal Protection 
                becomes mandatory. 
              <DT>-Clinical Evaluation: as soon as the Medical Removal Protection 
                is initiated. See the clinical evaluation described above. 
              <DT>-Laboratory Testing: Complete lab panel (see above). Repeat

              <DT>d- When an employee reports signs or symptoms of lead toxiciy, 
                desires advice about effects of lead exposure (on reproductive 
                system, child bearing, etc.), has increased risk of material impairment

                respirator use. 
              <DT>-Clinical Evaluation: as soon as possible (see above). 
              <DT>-Laboratory Testing: as deemed appropriate by the physician

              <DT>D- Medical Removal Protection : 
              <DT>The physician must recommend to the employer that an employee 
                be removed from lead exposure and enter a Medical Removal Protection 
                program if any of the following conditions are met. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>1- General Industry Standard : 
              <DT>a-A single BLL=or&gt; 2.896 &#181;mol/L, or 
              <DT>b-An average of the last three (3) BLLs or of all BBLs over 
                the previous 6 months (whichever covers a longer period of time) 
                is=or&gt;2.413 &#181;mol/L. 
              <DT>c-The employee has a &#171; detected medical condition &#187; 
                that places him or her at increased risk of &#171; material impairment 
                to health &#187;. The physician is given the discretion to make 
                such a determination on an individual case basis. 
              <DT>d-When the physician detects symptoms and/or clinical signs 
                usually associated with lead poisoning even if the BLL is lower 
                than the standards cited above, or when the employee is pregnant. 
              <DT>e-When the employee is withdrawn from work, Laboratory Testing 
                (Biological Monitoring) must be done at least once per month. 
              <DT>f-When the BLL is twice consecutively = or &lt; 1.93 &#181;mol/L. 
                the physician may recommend the return to work provided that the 
                employer has taken proper steps to control lead exposure and that 
                the symptoms/ clinical signs of the intoxication have disappeared. 
              <DT>g-During Medical Removal Protection a physician may recommend 
                that an employee, if physically able, returns to work in a place 
                where there is no lead exposure, or in a place where lead exposure 
                is below the AL (Action Level) which is below .03 mg/m3.

              <DT><B>I-Acute Intoxication :</B> 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>It consists of : 
              <DT>a gastric lavage with a solution precipitating lead in the form 
                of insoluble sulphate, for example : 
              <DT>- soda sulphate, 
              <DT>- magnesia sulphate aa 40g, 
              <DT>- water ad 1 liter; 
              <DT>- daily injection of calcium EDTA, in association with BAL in 
                the child; 
              <DT>- need to treat shock, especially by the parenteral rehydration. 
              <DT>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              <DT><B>II-Chronic Intoxication :</B> 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>A-Chelation Therapy : 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>1-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent 
                capable of fixing lead, calcium and other cations to form a non-ionized 
                complex. To avoid hypocalcemy, a salt of calcium or disodium should 
                be given. Lead (but also other metals: zinc, copper, iron) will 
                replace calcium. The soluble complex lead-EDTA is quickly excreted 
                by the kidneys (glomerular filtration). 
              <DT>Since EDTA is toxic to the kidneys, especially to the glomerular 
                basal membrane, its administration should be done with prudence 
                in the presence of renal ailments. Renal function should be monitored 
                during treatment. The maximum amount to be given should not exceed 
                50mg/kg/day. 
              <DT>Treatment must last 5 days and if urinary lead remains high, 
                it can be repeated after a period of rest of at least 4 to 5 days. 
              <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
              <DT>2-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid trisodium salt, monocalcic) 
                seems slightly more effective than EDTA. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>3-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) given orally in gradually increasing 
                amounts has been recommended. Its administration is more effective 
                than EDTA when the presence of lead in the digestive tract can 
                be excluded. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>4-Double chelation therapy with EDTA and DMSA has been recommended 
                in the case of significant intoxication. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>5-In the case of lead encephalopathy in the child, it seems 
                that the combined administration of BAL and EDTA is preferable 
                to EDTA alone. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>Finally, let us remember that the preventive administration 
                of a chelating agent is to be prohibited. Only the control of 
                the work environment represents the method of adequate prevention. 
                A drug cannot replace industrial hygiene measures. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>B-Symptomatic Treatment : 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>It is of various types: 
              <DT>a-in lead colicky abdominal pain: antispasmodic drugs; 
              <DT>b-in lead encephalopathy : 
              <DT>-treatment of convulsions by barbiturates, 
              <DT>-treatment of intracranial hypertension by the intravenous administration 
                of a hypertonic solution. 
              <DT>c-in paroxystic hypertension: blood pressure lowering drugs. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>In the case of renal impairment, peritoneal dialysis allows 
                a significant and fast elimination of lead, avoiding kidney poisonous 
                chelating drugs. 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT><B>III-Treatment of Lead Impregnation : </B> 
              <DT>&nbsp; 
              <DT>In the case of lead impregnation, hazard control is a must (prevention 
                measures, job change) and possibly, an EDTA treatment in the adult, 
                4g/day by mouth, during 5 to 10 days. By mouth, dimercaptosuccinic 
                acid (DMSA) seems more active than EDTA.
