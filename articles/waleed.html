            <p><img src="images/waleed_figure.jpg" alt="Waleed Qaisi, 'Figure'" width="180" height="313" align="left">I 
              SEE CERAMIC ART as a self-independent art, having its own forms, 
              colors and structures. However, I declare my objection and disobedience 
              to the old concepts, or the stereotypes of ceramics that are intended 
              to be a utilitarian or applied art. Generally, there are two confusing 
              aspects of ceramic: first, between the desire for expression and 
              expression itself and the material for expression and, second, between 
              construction and the material of construction. Therefore, I see 
              ceramic art as not mental stimulation but, by composing abstracted 
              ideas or idealistic shapes, it will continue as a marker for humanistic 
              and spiritual values.</p>
            <p> A shape is a language, its words are written on the surface and 
              color that must be poured in a new modern cast to help me understand 
              all the things that 1 have formed and transformed, that is, to explain 
              why I have allowed a dominating form to exist iII the artwork under 
              a mask that seems characterless. It is normal that all shapes are 
              made through the feeling of its inside volume; the work must have 
              harmony and react with its dimensions and mass because its correlation 
              will not be according to the subject itself nor to the involving 
              emotions, but to the direct senses.</p>

            <p> <img src="images/waleed_mural.jpg" alt="'Waleed Qaisi, Mural'" width="220" height="231" align="left">That 
              is why all my shapes are spontaneous and simple. When I start to 
              create work, my hands work spontaneously and my eyes search in it, 
              because clay as a substance has no meaning iI1 itself yet has a 
              tremendous influence on me as a ceramic artist. I sense the originality 
              of the artwork from inside - the shape and non-shape; and in order 
              to stabilize the world by means of time and place, I try, in this 
              sense, to abstract the beautifulness of touch in color, shape and 
              non-shape before reducing it towards a visible world.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/waleed_sculptures.jpg"><img src="images/waleed_sculptures_sm.jpg" alt="Waleed Qaisi, Sculpture" width="220" height="84" border="0"></a><br>
              <font size="-2">click to enlarge</font></p>
            <p> I have a strong desire to distort the shapes I make because I 
              find an extra freedom which pushes me towards art creation rather 
              than towards abilities of the mind, although I wish to discover 
              those abilities too; and so much of my work ends as disfigured structures. 
              Because of the full awareness of the ceramist for his materials, 
              the world and shapes around him, he is led to discover new shapes 
              and structures rich in beauty. However, I always try to put my shapes 
              and structures in a modern cast and I decorate the forms in relation 
              to the modern humanitarian civilized world. My work can be categorized 
              as decorated shapes, colored dances, free lines, renewed volumes, 
              music and running away from oneself into a scattered self in disorder. 
            </p>
            <p>I have reached this level of knowledge through my readings in ceramic 
              art and art in general, and through various and endless experiments 
              and, finally, my desire to destroy my shapes and then reshape them.</p>
