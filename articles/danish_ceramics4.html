              The factory was established in 1843 by potter Rasmus Peter Ipsen 
              (1815-60) from Bornholm. 
            <P align="left"> When he was 13 years old, Peter Ipsen was sent into 
              service at a brickyard, where he, in his own words, was carrying 
              4000 bricks each and every day, which marked him for the rest of 
              his life. Later he was apprenticed with a joiner where he worked 
              from 5am to 10pm which was so bad for his constitution that he had 
              to quit. 
            <P align="left"> A school friend found a job for him as a trainee 
              at The Royal Copenhagen. He soon became a masterly thrower with 
              a great sense for the design and colors, and in 1843 (28 years old) 
              he had his own pottery and married Lovise Christine Ipsen (1822-1905).

            <P align="left"> Hanging flowerpots in terracotta was the livelihood 
              of the factory, but also pots, amphorae vases painted in oil colors 
              and figurines, often inspired by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen 
              (1770-1844).<br>
              Peter established contact with that times Danish artists - among 
              these many sculptors, and he succeeded so much that he in 1847 could 
              afford to build a new factory in Utterslev outside Copenhagen. 
            <P align="center"><a href="images/danish/Ipsenorangepipeholder.jpg"><img src="images/danish/Ipsenorangepipeholder_sm%20.jpg" alt="Ipsen orange pipe holder" width="168" height="120" hspace="2" border="0"></a>

            <P align="left"> Peter Ipsen died in an early life, only 45 years 
              old (1860), his widow Lovise Ipsen continued his work, which was 
              rather unusual in these days, but she had a good knowledge of the 
              factory, as she had always been a regular visitor there. The oldest 
              son Bertel Ipsen (1846-1917) who was also a potter, took over management 
              in 1865. 
            <P align="center"><a href="images/danish/Ipsenlustreglazedvasewithgoldglazedhandles1875.jpg"><img src="images/danish/Ipsenlustreglazedvasewithgoldglazedhandles1875_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen lustre glazed vase with gold glazed handles year 1875" width="92" height="120" hspace="5" border="0"></a><a href="images/danish/IpsenparrotglazedfloorvasewithowlsbyNielsNorvil1915.jpg"><img src="images/danish/IpsenparrotglazedfloorvasewithowlsbyNielsNorvil1915_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen parrot glazed floor vase with owls by Niels Norvil year 1915" width="80" height="120" hspace="5" border="0"></a>

            <P align="left"> Bertel Ipsen continued in his father's footsteps, 
              with the &quot;Thorvaldsen Style&quot;, and he was represented at 
              most world exhibitions. He opened shops in Paris and London. In 
              1872 Ipsens Enke (enke means widow) make their first glaze. In the 
              early days, it can be difficult to distinguish Ipsen's terracotta 
              from L. Hjorth's terracotta, if the items were unsigned. Often they 
              used the same motives and models, and even though the 2 factories 
              were competitors, they often cooperated and Hjorth now and then 
              helped Ipsen with the production. Some of Hjorts potters also, from 
              time to time, worked at Ipsen's. 
            <P align="center"><a href="images/danish/Ipsenamphorevase1875.jpg"><img src="images/danish/Ipsenamphorevase1875_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen amphore vase year 1875" width="79" height="120" hspace="5" border="0"></a><a href="images/danish/IpsenblackglazedThemermaidsfindbyEllenLocher1905.jpg"><img src="images/danish/IpsenblackglazedThemermaidsfindbyEllenLocher1905_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen, black glazed The Mermaids by Ellen Locher, 1905" width="109" height="120" hspace="5" border="0"></a><a href="images/danish/IpsenyellowgreenswanvasebyAxelJensen1905.jpg"><img src="images/danish/IpsenyellowgreenswanvasebyAxelJensen1905_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen yellowgreen swan vase by Axel Jensen year 1905" width="91" height="120" hspace="5" border="0"></a> 
            <P align="left"> The style changed in the 1890's, and they moved towards 
              production of black fired terracotta. But with Thorvald Bindesb&oslash;ll 
              (architect and sculptor, 1846-1908), Georg Jensen (sculptor and 
              silversmith, 1866-1935) and Christian Joachim (painter and potter, 
              1870-1943), the Jugendstyle (Art Nouveau) had it's entry. 
            <P align="left"> <img src="images/danish/Bindesboll.jpg" alt="Thorvald Bindesb&oslash;ll (1901)" width="100" height="122" align="left">Thorvald 
              Bindesb&oslash;ll, who was one of the pioneers within Danish ceramics, 
              was a very eccentric artist. His nickname was &quot;Boelle&quot; 
              (danish for &quot;Rough&quot;). Either you loved him or you hated 
              him. But Bertel Ipsen regarded him as exciting and had a good cooperation 
              with him. 
            <P align="left"> Georg Jensen made a few things for Ipsen, before 
              he established his world famous silversmithy in 1904. 
            <P align="left"> <a href="images/danish/IpsenvasewithDanitglazebyAxelSalto1951.jpg"><img src="images/danish/IpsenvasewithDanitglazebyAxelSalto1951_sm.jpg" alt="Ipsen vase with Danit glaze by Axel Salto, 1951." width="140" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>Christian 
              Joachim was known for his vases with fungus motives. Even though 
              he lost his right arm as a child, he studied to be a painter and 
              was a skilled artist. He later became artistic leader of the Aluminia 
              Faience factory, art director on The Royal Copenhagen.<br>
              In 1920-40 following new glazes were developed: 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Chameleon glaze&quot; (shining in various colors added 
                gold, platinum or silver)</li>
              <li>&quot;Jade glaze&quot; (dull green)</li>
              <li>&quot;Danit glaze&quot; (Red-lilac or blue-green in a big crackled 
                network)</li>
              <li>&quot;Metal glaze&quot; (mainly in green colors)</li>
              <li>&quot;Bronze glaze&quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;Ivory glaze&quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;Oxblood glaze&quot;, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <P align="left"> Georg Thylstrup (silversmith and potter, 1884-1930 
              sculptor)<br>
              produced a number of fishwife's mermaids and fabulous monsters. 
              <br>
              Kai Nielsen (painter and sculptor, 1882-1924) is mostly known for 
              his figurine &quot;Venus Kalipygos&quot;. The name is taken from 
              the Greek god of love Aphrodite's nickname &quot;Kalipygos&quot;. 
              These figurines were in great demand.

            <P align="left"> Ib Just Andersen (sculptor and silversmith, 1884-1943) 
              produced in 1940 a few fish and mermaids, which are reminiscent 
              of the figures and vases etc. he later produced in diskometal from 
              his world famous silversmithy. 
            <P align="left"> Besides from those already mentioned, a number of
