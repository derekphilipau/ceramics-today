                <P>For the past eight years I have lived and worked on a scrubby 
                  patch of tropical hinterland an hour's drive from the port city 
                  of Mackay in North Queensland. The land is dominated by Eungella 
                  National Park mountains on three horizons. Between myself and 
                  the mountains, at the back of the house and workshop are cane 
                  fields; canefields to the left, too, and, beyond that, a hill, 
                  and scrub, and the hamlet: Netherdale. In front, and to the 
                  right, is a planted forest of eucalyptus and rainforest trees, 
                  a creek hidden under green, and cane fields beyond, and beyond 
                  again. I have watched a few straggly seedlings grow into a wide 
                  green canopy, cooling the house; and each year wait out the 
                  dry, or the wet, always a little extreme. Just now, after rain, 
                  there is the monotone chorus of frogs; but the dominant theme 
                  here is silence. I came here because it was beautiful, run down 
                  and affordable and a wood kiln wouldn't bother anyone. Work, 
                  I thought, would be uninterrupted, and my leaning towards solitude 
                  would feel saner in this space than on the fringe of inner-city 
                  academe. This time I didn't come for the clay, or the wood, 
                  but for the making, and the quiet. It was a risky move, and 
                  I felt a little absurd. I had read Thea Astley, and Patrick 
                  White, and David Malouf.</P>
                <P> Before coming here, I had started to look more closely at 
                  how pots, perfectly contained within themselves, sit with each 
                  other, changing each other. I was interested to find what could 
                  hold the pots together in a bonding that was neither design 
                  nor intention but could only be discovered after the firing 
                  when everything came into play: lushness, coolness, colour, 
                  weight, line. Lately, I would add character.</P>
                <P> I had seen Giorgio Morandi's paintings, etchings and drawings 
                  first in Paris at the huge 1972 retrospective, and then again 
                  at Bologna at the centenary exhibition in 1990. I love his searching, 
                  excessive, describing of the common objects that were his subject 
                  and his measure. A bottle: a dense palpable block of creamy 
                  white. A bottle: a wavering half line holding space. His work 
                  is substantial, tenuous; disturbing, resolved. His work is not 
                  about character. It is about essence; the metaphysical expressed 
                  through the solidly physical and knowable.</P>
                <P> Of some artists' work, you can say, yes, if I understood that 
                  I would understand all I need to know about expressed beauty. 
                  For me, Morandi's work is like that; and that of Piero della 
                  Franscesca. But so are many, many bowls.</P>
                <P> I could try, perhaps, to scrutinise my pots in the way I imagine 
                  Morandi looked at his beloved still life subjects: those old 
                  tin cans, assorted bottles, paper roses, coffee bowls, metal 
                  boxes, shells, pots and pans, some battered and painted over, 
                  that have outlasted him. But it won't do. I don't intend to 
                  re-present my pots and position them in fields of colour so 
                  dense and greyed they lock and surround and make them poignant 
                  or monumental by the solidity of the strong, thick, paint itself. 
                  My pots have to stand as they are, as real as my hand; and it 
                  seems I have so little time to know them before they are gone.</P>
                <P> Morandi's work can inspire and direct my eye and hint at eccentric 
                  joinings and haunting colour. But it is a big leap from standing, 
                  grateful as anything, in front of his canvases, to looking at 
                  the tangible, usable, everyday pots that salt my life: pots 
                  which need, too, that kind and urgent attention. This gap has 
                  been, at times, a sadness for me. I know the pots I live with 
                  and sometimes make can be potent. Potent as language, potent 
                  as solace, potent as messages. Writers, poets, artists, have 
                  described again and again the force of these everyday objects, 
                  but who knows how many potters, knowing, finally, the rightness 
                  of their work, have despaired of having their work actually 
                  perceived.</P>
                <P> &quot;Just a bowl,&quot; my co-judge of a significant national 
                  exhibition said (his eye already on the next object), &quot;it 
                  has to be more than just a beautiful bowl.&quot; Why? I ask, 
                  there is nothing just about it. But one goes on, with the colour 
                  blends, and glaze tests, the accumulating buckets of stained 
                  glaze; arranging the wood for the firing that may or may not 
                  give you that pulling back of iron in the mixed stain to make 
                  that particular purple/bronze, or that that slight bloom the 
                  severe shape needs to make it tender: wondering if the porcelain 
                  you are using fired for longer might just soften enough to make 
                  the line of that bowl more languid. Paring, honing, adding. 
                  Head in hands after the firing, as like as not; but sometimes, 
                  utterly thankful. It is an old story, the maker's story.</P>
                <P> I might say I started the groupings because I wanted the pots 
                  to be looked at. Considered. The title, Three Inseparable Bowls, 
                  given to related but different bowls, might raise a question, 
                  lengthen a glance. Why inseparable? What is the glue? There 
                  were groupings of small jugs, simplified. I could have eaten 
                  them with their echoing colours and line.</P>
                <P> Later, (was it? the story could be told many ways) came the 
                  still life groupings which were far more intuitive, and often 
                  surprising. Within them, there were tensions and resolutions, 
                  quirky relationships and sometimes a certain restful classicism. 
                  With them came, naturally, recollections of certain paintings; 
                  I made the lips finer, so bowls were blocks of colour with drawn 
                  edges. Bottles were seamless, sketched. I dared myself to go 
                  to the edge of formlessness. The space between the pots became 
                  more telling and echoed or bound the solid shapes. I became 
                  precise about placement.</P>
                <P> To my delight, the pared down forms remained pots. Not metaphors, 
                  or suggestions: but pots, glazed, strong, usable. What is more, 
                  this eccentric presentation, unframed, unboxed, completely floating 
                  on an idea was accepted. I saw it as something and trusted its 
                  lead. I gave names to some groupings to suggest ways of looking: 
                  Still life for Ben Nicholson. I was presumptuous, yes, but hopefully, 
                  gave a clue to its reading.</P>
                <P>Events forced new looking. Asked to be part of a touring show 
                  about landscape, I made horizontal groupings begging a slow 
                  wandering of the eye, an exploring or perambulation around and 
                  up and over. The material dominated; rich, craggy bottles; dishes 
                  limpid and liquid as lagoons. Pots made to be looked at closely 
                  as though viewed from a distance.</P>
