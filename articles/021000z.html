<H3>Photographing Your Own Work (continued)</H3>


 
<h5>Setting up your work</h5>
<p>After you have decided where you want to do the photography, set up your backdrop 
  on a table and up against a wall, so that it curves gently from vertical to 
  horizontal. You will place your ceramic or other work on the bottom third of 
  the backdrop -- usually the area where it is noticeably fading into white. Group 
  multiples in such a way that the edges of the backdrop are not visible in the 
  camera lens. If this is unavoidable, you need a bigger backdrop. Platters can 
  be propped up against something, as long as it's not visible in the lens. Avoid 
  using things like bricks for this purpose, as they will scratch and permanently 
  damage the surface of your expensive backdrop!</p>
<h5>Setting up camera and lighting</h5>
<p>It is preferable to mount your camera onto a tripod. This need not be expensive 
  at all, as long as you have a cable release or even an auto release (usually 
  for self-portraits). Pushing the button on a camera mounted on a flimsy tripod 
  may result in blurred pictures or shifted framing. The distance from the work 
  will depend on the camera lens, the size of the work and the size restraints 
  of the backdrop.</p>
<p>If you are using high wattage bulbs, place some tracing paper or something 
  similar in front of them (you will have to rig something up -- beware of heat!) 
  to avoid strong shadows. Place them to the front left and front right of the 
  work. If you have sunlight filtering into the room, try to have this behind 
  you (but not casting a visible shadow onto your picture frame!). If the lighting 
  conditions permit, you can also place some sheets of large white cardboard to 
  the left and right of the work (outside the visible area through the lens), 
  which will reflect more light creating a soft fill-in light.</p>
<h5>Taking the photos</h5>
<p>Make sure you have plenty of time. Hurrying things up won't yield good results. 
  Make sure you have framed the scene well. Avoid getting the edge of the backdrop 
  into the frame of the picture. If you can't avoid it, get a larger backdrop. 
  If you have particularly large work to photograph, you may need to consider 
  using a large sheet of white fabric. Make sure the lighting is correct. Is the 
  sun just obscured by some clouds? Do you see any strong shadows? Is the work, 
  and is the tripod straight? Is your dog about to bump the tripod and knock everything 
  over? </p>
<p>Bracket your shots, at least until you know how your setup works. That means 
  to take one shot underexposed by one or a half of one f-stop (provided you 
  lens has half f-stops!), the next at the correct light meter reading, and another 
  at one or a half of one f-stop overexposed. This will show you which settings 
  will work best with the same setup in the future.<a name="here"></a></p>
