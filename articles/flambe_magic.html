              </b>Author John Britt investigates the appearance of mysterious crystals 
              in the glaze slop.

            <p><img src="images/britt_flambe/image74.jpg" width="208" height="320" align="left">While 
              conducting researching for my book, <a href="http://www.johnbrittpottery.com/pub.html"><i>The
              Complete Guide to High-Fire Glazes</i></a>, one copper red glaze, 
              Jeff&#8217;s Red, always had a different fired appearance. I initially 
              attributed this to variations in application, speed of firing and 
              cooling, or variations in atmosphere. Several months later, however, 
              when small crystals developed in the glaze slop, I began to wonder. 
              I first noticed small lumps in the glaze coat on the pot which I 
              thought were bugs or bits of sawdust which occasionally fall into 
              an uncovered glaze bucket. However, during the winter while my glazes 
              were subject to freezing conditions in an unheated shed I noticed 
              that these were not lumps but were small flat hexagonal flakes of 
              material which grew larger in size. These flakes were actually small 
              crystals which floated on or just under the surface of the thickened 
              glaze. (Images 2, 3)</p>
            <p>To figure out what they were, I fired several in a small bowl in 
              an electric kiln; opening it periodically during the firing I noticed 
              that they foamed intensely around 600&deg;F (315&deg;C), indicating 
              that the water of hydration was burning off. They subsequently melted 
              into a pool of glaze/glass around 1600&deg;F (870&deg;C). While 
              crystals placed on the side of a pot and gently heated with a propane 
              torch melted into a liquid and dribbled down the side. After various 
              enquiries, I concluded that these must be sodium borate crystals, 
              which precipitated from the glaze mixture as it cooled. One popular 
              remedy is to sieve them out, re-dissolve them in warm water and 
              then pour the water back into the glaze, instead I decided to glaze 
              and fire a pot with as many crystals on it as possible. This produced 
              a magnificent flamb&eacute; glazed bowl; the crystals apparently 
              fluxed out, melting down the side creating the effect.</p>

            <p>Still uncertain that the crystals were the primary cause of the 
              variegated flamb&eacute; effect rather than the firing cycle, I 
              fired two similarly shaped pieces on the same shelf, one glazed 
              with a fresh batch and the other with the &#8216;crystallized&#8217; 
              batch (Images 15 -17). The effect was only reproduced on the piece 
              with the &#8216;crystallized&#8217; mixture, demonstrating that 
              it was the cause of the variegated flamb&eacute; surface.</p>
            <p><b>Other glazes</b></p>
            <p> Realizing that crystals were forming in the glaze slop caused 
              me to examine the other glazes in storage and look for patterns 
              in the recipes. For my book, I had mixed up approximately 400 glazes, 
              including copper red, shino, iron, Oribe, and crystalline glazes, 
              all in quart containers, which were stored in the unheated shed. 
              Winters in Penland, North Carolina, USA, are moderate, with temperatures 
              hovering around freezing, but it can easily drop to 10&deg;F (-10&deg;C) 
              or rise to 50&deg;F (10&deg;C). Glazes stored outside are therefore 
              subject to a series of freezing and thawing cycles from October 
              to March.</p>
            <p>The crystals mainly occurred in glazes with borates, or with borates 
              and lithium carbonate, and varied from 1/2&#8221; (1.3cm) thick 
              by 2&#8221; (5cm) in diameter (Images 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10) to some 
              that were so small it felt like sand in the glaze. Others covered 
              the top of the 5&#8221; (13cm) container with a thin matrix of crystals. 
              Most were an opaque white but a number were red from iron oxide 
              or green from copper carbonate being caught up in the crystal (Images 
              7, 9). To isolate their effect, some of the larger crystals were 
              placed on the sides of pots and fired to cone 10 (Images 1, 6 and 
              8).</p>

            <p>Since there are over 120 known borate mineral formations and I 
              decided to have mine analysed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and found 
              that some did contain a type of borax (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)4&middot;8H<sub>2</sub>O), 
              while others contained lithium borate hydrate (Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&middot;16H<sub>2</sub>O) 
              along with miscellaneous minerals like quartz, feldspars and other 
              trace materials. The crystals occurred mainly in batches of copper 
              red glazes, including Jeff&#8217;s Red, Mary&#8217;s Surprise, Purple 
              Red, Splotchy Lavender and Purple Sludge, but also in VC Matte Turquoise 
              and Karen&#8217;s Starshine, as well as many of my raku glazes. 
              Each recipe contained borates, either from natural sources (gerstley 
              borate or its substitutes) or frits, demonstrating that many frits 
              (Ferro 3134, 3185, 3195, 3191, or Pemco P-54, etc) are slightly 
              soluble in water. </p>
            <p>It is evident that the flamb&eacute; effect in Jeff&#8217;s Red 
              was caused by soluble materials migrating into crystals as the slurry 
              cooled. This meant that the mesh size of soluble colour enhancing 
              oxides, like lithium, sodium and boron, was increasing and that 
              new combinations of materials were forming with higher concentrations 
              of colorants, like copper and iron. Firing them on the pot created 
              areas of greater concentration of those materials.</p>
            <p><b>Solubility</b></p>
            <p> All ceramic materials have physical and chemical properties that 
              will have an effect on glazes, including mesh size, melting and 
              volatilisation point, surface tension, solubility, etc. One key 
              property is solubility, which is the ability of a material to go 
              into solution at a given temperature. Soluble and slightly soluble 
              compounds include borax, soda ash, pearl ash, Epsom salts, wood 
              ash, gerstley borate (and its substitutes), copper sulphate, nepheline 
              syenite, lithium carbonate, barium carbonate, etc. Solubility usually 
              varies with temperature. For example, 23.3g of sodium tetraborate 
              (borax) will dissolve in 100g of water at 140&deg;F (60&deg;C). 
              But at 32&deg;F (0&deg;C) only 1.3g will dissolve. So in a glaze 
              made up at 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) and slowly cooled toward freezing, 
              22g of borax will precipitate out. Also, if the volume of water 
              is reduced, from evaporation, some of the solute will fall out of 
              solution. But rather than fall to the bottom of the bucket, the 
              charged ionic particles can be attracted to a seed crystal (almost 
              any small clump of material) and, as the temperature drops, more 
              and more ions are attracted in a regular pattern, thus creating 
              a crystal. This is, undoubtedly, a dynamic process where some materials 
              react and fall out of solution which allows more room for other 
              materials to go into solution.</p>

            <p>One interesting thing was that crystals did not occur in all the 
              glazes that contained borates and lithium oxide. Over half of the 
              80 copper red recipes tested had no crystals, suggesting that there 
              are factors influencing crystal formation other than cooling, evaporation, 
              and the availability of soluble borates, sodium and lithium oxide. 
              One possibility could be variations in pH or the glazes.</p>
            <p>The pH value of a solution refers to its acidity or alkalinity. 
              This often stems from a material&#8217;s ability to go into solution 
              rather than stay in suspension. Since multiple materials are used 
              in a glaze, the pH of one material can affect the ability of other 
              materials to go into solution. For example, barium carbonate is 
              listed as insoluble in pure water but glaze slops can be slightly 
              acidic (flocculated) and in those cases barium carbonate can be 
              slightly soluble. Materials that are slightly soluble will dissolve 
              in the glaze slop into extremely small charged particles, or ions. 
            </p>
            <p>These small dissolved ions can greatly affect the condition of 
              the glaze slop, and may cause it to become flocculated or deflocculated 
              and thus more difficult to handle. Plant or wood ash, for example, 
              which is high in soluble salts, if used straight from the hearth 
              can easily deflocculate a glaze slop, making it too thin. To avoid 
              this and provide consistency, ash can be washed before being used. 
              Flocculants, like Epsom salts, cause the glaze slop to gel or thicken, 
              which may make the application too thick, resulting in cracking 
              as it dries. Flocculation and deflocculation are not bad in themselves; 
              they are merely conditions of a glaze slop. Some glazes are purposely 
              deflocculated to aid in spraying or brushing, or flocculated to 
              help keep particles suspended. It only becomes a problem if it is 
              out of control.</p>

            <p><b>Handling soluble materials</b></p>
            <p> Frits, created partly to avoid solubility problems associated 
              with some materials or to make toxic materials such as lead safer 
              to handle, are manufactured by taking soluble materials and mixing 
              them with clay, silica or a variety of other oxides, firing them 
              to melting point and pouring them into water to make them shatter 
              before grinding into a powder. Nevertheless, some frits, such as 
              the alkali, remain slightly soluble, in spite of, being labelled 
              as insoluble.</p>
            <p>Soluble materials need careful attention. Those dissolved in the 
              glaze slop will be lost if water is poured off to thicken the glaze 
              slurry. They will also migrate into the bisque ware as a glazed 
              pot dries, which can affect the clay body because some of the fluxing 
              oxides will remain there. They can also make the final look of the 
              glaze difficult to control because the drying process often creates 
              uneven concentrations of these materials, depending on where the 
              water is evaporating. These are all sound reasons to avoid using 
              them.</p>
            <p>However, by excluding them we risk missing some remarkable effects. 
              Carbon trap shinos and self-glazing clays like, Egyptian paste, 
              both depend on the migration of soluble salts to create their characteristic 
              look. And now we see that soluble materials in our glaze slurry 
              can crystallize from cooling the glaze slurry, which, because of 
              the uneven concentrations of oxides in the crystal formations, can 
              cause beautiful and unusual glaze surfaces.</p>

            <p>Crystals will also form if glaze slurries containing soluble materials 
              are allowed to dry out completely. As the water evaporates the soluble 
              ingredients form small crystals, which may be seen on the sides 
              of the bucket and on the surface of the dried glaze. Once the glaze 
              is fully dried you can add water and allow it to rehydrate. Using 
              it without sieving or grinding up the chunks can result in some 
              interesting surfaces. I have done this with carbon trap shinos and 
              Karen&#8217;s Starshine (Images 13, 14). Many potters may be experiencing 
              this effect without realizing it, as we often allow our glazes to 
              dry out when not in use. Then, in a rush to glaze something, we 
              re-wet and apply them, often without sieving.</p>
            <p>Crystal growth is easily demonstrated by saturating water with 
              a soluble material and then cooling it. I grew some examples, such 
              as soda ash and tri-sodium phosphate crystals (Images 11, 12). For 
              those interested, the book &#8220;Crystal and Crystal Growing&#8221;, 
              by Holden and Morrison is very helpful in explaining the crystals 
              and practical ways to grow them.</p>
            <p>Glazing and firing is an already complex process and discovering 
              that crystals can grow in glaze slops adds yet another variable. 
              We know that our glaze materials and kiln atmospheres are in constant 
              flux but so to may be the glaze slurry itself. These crystal formations, 
              some virtually invisible, could be causing migration of oxides within 
              the slurries that dramatically affect the outcome of the glaze appearance. 
              Since ancient potteries did not have modern heating technologies, 
              it is possible that some unique historic glaze effects may have, 
              inadvertently, been the result of crystallization of soluble oxides 
              in their glaze slops. </p>
