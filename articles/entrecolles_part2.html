              Part 2 
            <p>From William Burton's <i>Porcelain, It's Art and Manufacture</i>, 
              B.T. Batsford, London, 1906. 
            <p>It is time to ennoble the porcelain by passing it over into the 
              hands of the painters.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> These porcelain 
              painters are not less poor and wretched than the other workmen, 
              which is not very surprising when we remember that in Europe they 
              would only pass for apprentices of a few months' standing. All the 
              science of these painters, and of Chinese painters in general, is 
              based on no principles, and only consists in a certain routine helped 
              by a limited turn of imagination. They know nothing of the beautiful 
              rules of this art; though it must be acknowledged that they paint 
              flowers, animals, and landscapes which are much admired, on porcelain 
              as well as on fans and lanterns of the finest gauze. The painting 
              is distributed in the same workshop among a great number of workmen. 
              One workman does nothing but draw the first colour line beneath 
              the rims of the pieces; another traces flowers, which a third one 
              paints; this man is painting water and mountains, and that one either 
              birds or other animals. Human figures are generally treated the 
              worst. Certain landscapes and plans of towns that are brought over 
              from Europe to China will hardly allow us, however, to mock at the 
              Chinese for the manner in which they represent themselves in their 
              paintings. 
            <p> <img src="images/plum_blossom_jar.gif" alt="Plum Blossom Jar" width="186" height="274" align="left">As 
              for the porcelain colours, they are of every kind. In Europe people 
              hardly see anything else but a vivid blue on a white ground, though 
              I believe that our merchants have also imported some of the other 
              kinds.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> There are some pieces the ground 
              of which is like that of our polished metal mirrors; others are 
              wholly red, and among these some have the red in the glaze, while 
              others are of a <i>souffl&eacute;</i> red<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
              and are sprinkled with little dots almost like our miniatures. When 
              these two kinds of work are successfully produced which is rather 
              difficult-they are highly prized and extremely dear. 
            <p> Finally there are porcelain pieces where the landscapes with which 
              they are painted are formed of nearly all the different colours, 
              enhanced by the brilliance of gilding. These are very beautiful 
              when no expense is spared, but the ordinary porcelain of this kind 
              is not to be compared with that painted in blue alone. It says in 
              the annals of Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n that formerly the people 
              only used white porcelain ; apparently they had not found in the 
              neighborhood of Jao-chou a blue equal to that which comes from a 
              great distance and which is very dear. 
            <p> It is said that a porcelain merchant, having been wrecked on a 
              desert coast, found there more riches than he had lost. While he 
              was roaming about the shore, and his servants were making a small 
              vessel out of the remains of his ship, he perceived that stones 
              fit to make the most beautiful blue were quite common there. He 
              took with him a big load, and they say that such beautiful blue 
              had never been seen at Ching-t&ecirc;-ch&ecirc;n. Later on the Chinese 
              merchant tried in vain to find the coast where chance had once sent 
              him.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
            <p> The blue is made in the following way : It is buried in the gravel 
              that lies half a foot deep on the bed of the porcelain furnace, 
              where it is roasted for twenty-four hours; then it is reduced to 
              an impalpable powder in the same way as other colours, not on a 
              marble slab, but in a large porcelain mortar, the bottom of which 
              is left unglazed, as is also the head of the pestle which is used 
              for pounding. 
            <p> The red is made from copperas (crystals of sulphate of iron), 
              and as it may be that the Chinese have something special in it, 
              I will report their method. They put a pound of copperas into a 
              crucible, which is well luted to a second crucible used as a cover, 
              in which they make a small hole, which is covered so that it can 
              be easily uncovered if needed. The whole is surrounded by a large 
              charcoal fire, and in order to have more heat reverberated upon 
              it they put bricks all round about it. As long as the smoke that 
              rises (from the hole in the top crucible) is very black the material 
              is not yet ready, but it is finished as soon as a kind of thin fine 
              cloud appears. Then they take some of the stuff, mix it with water, 
              and make an experiment by rubbing it on a piece of fir wood. If 
              it produces a beautiful red they take away the charcoal fire and 
              partially cover the crucible. When this has cooled down a small 
              cake of the red colour is found at the bottom of the crucible, but 
              the finest red is that which is stuck to the inside of the covering 
              crucible. One pound of copperas makes four ounces of the red colour. 
            <p> Although porcelain is naturally white, and the glaze adds to its 
              whiteness, there are certain decorations for which they use a special 
              white on the porcelain that is painted in different colours. This 
              white is made from the powder of a transparent rock, which is calcined 
              in the oven in the same way as the azure blue.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> 
              To half an ounce of this powder they put an ounce of white lead. 
              This powder also is used in the preparation of other colours; for 
              example, to make a green they take half an ounce of the powder of 
              this pebble, and they add one ounce of white lead and three ounces 
              of the very purest scoriae of copper. 
            <p> The prepared green becomes the matrix of the violet colour, which 
              is obtained by adding a dose of white. The preparation of the green 
              is varied according to the tint of violet they wish to produce. 
            <p> A yellow colour is made by taking seven drachms of white prepared 
              as above, to which they add three drachms of the red colour made 
              from copperas. 
            <p> All these colours, put on to the porcelain that is already fired 
              after having been glazed, appear green, violet, yellow, or red only 
              after the second firing. The Chinese books say that these colours 
              can only be applied with white lead, saltpeter, and copperas. The 
              Christians who are employed in this work have only spoken to me 
              of white lead, which is mixed with the colour diluted with gum-water. 
              The red of which I have been speaking, with the ordinary porcelain 
              glaze, and another glaze made from white pebbles, are prepared in 
              the same way as the ordinary glazes. I have not been able to learn 
              the quantity either of one or the other; neither how much red is 
              mixed with this glaze; but experiments will reveal the secrets. 
              They then put the porcelain to dry, and fire it in the ordinary 
              oven. If after the firing the red comes out pure and brilliant without 
              blemishes, they have obtained the perfection of the art. These porcelain 
              pieces have no resonance when they are struck.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> 
              The other kind of red, known as <i>souffl&eacute;</i> red, is made 
              thus : The colour having been prepared, they take a tube, one end 
              of which is covered with very fine gauze; they softly apply the 
              bottom of the tube to the colour ; the gauze being filled with colour, 
              they blow into the tube, and the porcelain is covered all over with 
              little red spots. This kind of porcelain is rarer and dearer than 
              the other, because it is more difficult to make if they must observe 
              the necessary precautions. The black porcelain has also its value 
              and its beauty; this black contains lead, and is not unlike our 
              polished metal mirrors. When this is gilded it is still more charming. 
              The black colour is given to the porcelain when it is dry, and for 
              this purpose they mix three ounces of blue with seven ounces of 
              ordinary glaze.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Experiments will tell 
              you exactly how to make this mixture according to the required shade. 
              When the colour is dry they fire the porcelain, and afterwards they 
              paint the gold upon it and fire it again in a special furnace. 
            <p> Another kind of porcelain that is made here I have not seen before. 
              It is all perforated like cut paper work, while inside it is a cup 
              for holding a liquid. The cup is in one piece with the perforated 
              envelope. I have seen other porcelains on which Chinese and Tartar 
              ladies were painted in natural colours. The drapery, the complexion, 
              and the features were all exquisite, so that from a distance one 
              might have thought they were pieces of enamel. 
            <p> It may be remarked that when they use on their porcelains the 
              glaze made from white pebbles, the ware becomes a special kind which 
              they call Tsoui-ki. This is all marbled and cracked with an infinity 
              of veins, so that from a distance one might think it was shattered 
              into a thousand fragments without falling to pieces, so that it 
              resembles a piece of mosaic work. The colour which is given by this 
              glaze is a somewhat ashen white. If the piece of porcelain has been 
              painted in blue and this glaze is used upon it, it appears likewise 
              cracked and marbled when the colour is dry. 
            <p> When they wish to apply gold they beat it and grind it in water 
              in a porcelain dish until they see underneath the water a little 
              golden cloud. This they leave to dry, and in use they mix it with 
              a sufficiency of gum-water, and with thirty parts of gold they incorporate 
              three parts of white lead, and put it on the porcelain in the same 
              way as the colours. 
            <p> Finally there is a kind of porcelain made as follows They give 
              it the ordinary glaze and fire it, then they paint it with different 
              colours and fire it again; sometimes the painting is reserved intentionally 
              until after the first fire, and sometimes they use this method to 
              hide defects in the porcelain pieces by painting colours on the 
              defective places and firing them a second time. This porcelain, 
              though it is over-coloured, is, however, liked by many people. It 
              often happens that one feels unevennesses on porcelain of this kind, 
              which may be due to the want of skill of the workman, or it may 
              be that it was necessary to give shadows to the painting, or that 
              it was intended to cover the defects of the porcelain body. When 
              the painting is dry, as well as the gilding, if there is any, they 
              pile the porcelain pieces into the kiln, putting the small ones 
              into the big ones. The kilns for firing the goods may be made of 
              iron if they are small, but generally they are of clay. The one 
              I saw was as high as a man and nearly as wide as our biggest wine 
              cask; it was made in several pieces, and from the same materials 
              as the porcelain saggars, the separate pieces being a foot high 
              and a foot and a half long, though they were only a finger's breadth 
              thick. Before they were fired they had been rounded into the proper 
              shape; they were put one over another and well cemented. The bottom 
              of the kiln was raised half a foot from the ground. It was put on 
              rows of thick but not very big bricks, while round the kiln was 
              a wall of well-baked bricks, which had at the bottom three or four 
              holes like the hollows of a fireplace. This brick wall left an empty 
              space of about half a foot, with the exception of three or four 
              places which were filled up so as to make ribs for the kiln. I believe 
              they erect the kiln and its enclosure at the same time, otherwise 
              the kiln would have no support. They fill the kiln with the porcelain 
              pieces that are to be fired a second time, putting them in piles, 
              the smaller pieces into the bigger ones, as I have said. When all 
              is ready they cover the top of the kiln with pieces of pottery like 
              those used for the sides ; these pieces, which cross one another, 
              are closely united together by a clay mortar. Only in the middle 
              do they leave a hole through which they can see when the porcelain 
              is sufficiently fired. They light a quantity of charcoal under the 
              kiln as well as on the top, and they put pieces into the space between 
              the brick enclosure and the kiln, the hole on the top of the kiln 
              being covered with a piece of broken pitcher. When the fire has 
              become bright they look from time to time through this hole, and 
              when the porcelain seems shiny and the colours are bright and glossy 
              they pull out the fire and afterwards the porcelain. 
            <p align="center"><img src="images/fuchien.gif" alt="Fuchienand Ching-te-chen white" width="400" height="177"> 
            <p> An idea comes into my mind about these colours which are used 
              on porcelain pieces that have already been fired, and are rendered 
              glossy by means of white lead, to which, according to the annals 
              of Fou-Iiang they formerly added saltpeter and copperas. If one 
              were to use white lead with the colours that glass quarries are 
              painted with, and if, afterwards, one were to give them a second 
              firing, should we not recover the secret formerly possessed of painting 
              upon glass without losing anything of its transparency? One might 
              try by an experiment. This secret which we have lost makes me recall 
              another secret that the Chinese regret they possess no longer. They 
              once knew the art of painting on the sides of porcelain pieces fishes 
              or other animals that could only be seen when the piece was filled 
              with some liquid. They call this kind of porcelain &quot; azure 
              put in the press,&quot; because of the position in which the blue 
              colour is placed. I will give an account of what they have retained 
              of this secret, in the hope that Europeans may be able to contrive 
              what the Chinese no longer know. For this method the porcelain must 
              be very thin; when it was dry they put the colour rather plentifully, 
              not on the outside of the piece as is their usual custom, but on 
              the inside. They generally painted fishes, as if they were more 
              suitable to be revealed when the cup was filled with water. When 
              the colour had dried, they put a thin layer of dilute slip upon 
              it. This layer pressed the blue between the two sheets of clay. 
              When the layer was dry they put glaze inside the porcelain piece, 
              and some time afterwards they put it on the mould on the wheel. 
              As it had been thickened from the inside they pared it down on the 
              outside without going as far as the colour, and after that they 
              dipped the outside of the porcelain piece in the glaze, and, all 
              being dry, it was fired in the ordinary way. This was exceedingly 
              delicate work, and required skill that apparently the Chinese no 
              longer possess. From time to time they try to recover the art of 
              this magical painting, but in vain. One of them assured me a little 
              while ago that he had made fresh trials, and that lie had been nearly 
              successful. 
            <p> Be that as it may, it is possible to say that even now a beautiful 
              blue colour reappears on porcelain after having been lost for some 
              time. When the colour is first painted it is of a pale black ; when 
              it is dry and the glaze has been put upon it, it disappears entirely, 
              and the porcelain seems quite white, the colour being buried under 
              the glaze ; but the fire makes it appear in all its beauty, almost 
              in the same way as the natural heat of the sun makes the most beautiful 
              butterflies, with all their tints, come out of their eggs. I will 
              add a circumstance that I must not forget, viz.- that before the 
              porcelain is glazed they polish it, and remove the slightest irregularities. 
              For this purpose they use a brush made of very small feathers; the 
              brush being slightly dipped into the water and passed over the piece 
              with a very light touch. Great skill is required in putting the 
              glaze on to the porcelain so that it is not too thick, and that 
              it is evenly spread over the piece. For porcelain pieces that are 
              very thin and light, they apply two slight coats of glaze. If the 
              coats of glaze are too thick the thin sides of the vessel cannot 
              support them, and will instantly sink out of shape. These two layers 
              are equal to one ordinary layer of glaze such as is put on the thicker 
              pieces. The first coating is put on by sprinkling, the other by 
              immersion. The cup is held in the hand from outside, sloping over 
              the vessel that contains the glaze, and with the other hand they 
              pour inside as much glaze as is needed to wet it everywhere. This 
              is done to a great many cups, and when the first ones are dry inside, 
              the glaze is put on the outside as follows : The workman puts one 
              hand into the cup, and, supporting it with a little stick under 
              the middle of its foot, he dips it into the vessel filled with glaze, 
              and quickly draws it out again.<br>
