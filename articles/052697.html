<H3>Anagama</H3>

<p> <img align=left src="../images/martpot2.gif">The Anagama kiln is the <A HREF="http://www.the-anagama.com/En/koshigaraki/index.html"><B>oldest 

  style of kiln in Japan</B></A> and has been around since medieval times. The 

  beauty of <A HREF="../images/kilnnite.gif"><B>Anagama style firing</B></A> 

  lies in the natural ash glazes that can be achieved, and in the excitement of 

  the long firing itself, appreciated by many potters all over the world. 

<P> There are many different designs for the Anagama kiln, not only in Japan, 

  but on other continents. Not only are there different designs, but also different 

  <A HREF="091000a.html"><B>methods of firing</B></A> and <A HREF="../images/kilnint.gif"><B>stacking</B></A>.

  No two firings are ever exactly alike, in contrast to let's say, the electric 

  kiln. 

<P> The Anagama kiln will usually consist of of one long firing chamber with a 

  firebox at one end and a flue at the other. Often there will also be smaller 

  stacking ports on the side of the kiln. Traditional Anagama kilns are built 

  on a slope, so that a better updraught can be achieved. Firing time can vary 

  from one day to several weeks. 

<P> While Anagama is an ancient Japanese style, contemporary ceramic artists such 

  as <A HREF="http://www.the-anagama.com/En/voulkos/index.html"><B>Peter Voulkos</B></A> 

  (USA), <A HREF="http://www.the-anagama.com/En/nealie/index.html"><B>Chester 

  Nealie</B></A> (Australia), <a href="http://www.DickLehman.com/"><b>Dick Lehman</b></a> 

  (USA), <b><a href="http://www.uweloellmann.de/">Uwe Loellmann</a></b> or <A HREF="http://www.the-anagama.com/En/kanzaki_1/index.html"><B>Shiho 

  Kanzaki</B></A> (Japan) and many other have taken up the art and are continuing 

  the tradition.
