              by John Perreault 
            <p>&nbsp; 
            <p><img src="images/cecula/mcecula1.jpg" width="320" height="479" align="left">According 
              to some critics, craft has been assimilated by fine art, yet aside 
              from a few reviews in the N.Y. Times, I haven't noticed that the 
              battle had been won. I have not avoided writing about craft in these 
              pages [ed. note: NY Arts] because I thought the struggle was over, 
              but because it is time for me personally to move on to other issues. 
              Or more correctly, to find other ways of addressing my major theme.</p>
            <p>Are craft artists, particularly ceramicists, nicer people? The 
              discipleship of the hand tends to reward generosity more than the 
              discipleship of the conceptual. But if the truth be known, craft 
              artists and their collectors can be as wickedly self-centered as 
              paint-on-canvas artists, non-craft sculptors and their collectors. 
              Curators and dealers are also naturally self-serving. So what else 
              is new?</p>
            <p>What my writings have really been about from the beginning is the 
              interstitial, and ceramics, glass and other media-specific disciplines 
              fit quite nicely into that agenda. But before crafts, I wrote a 
              great deal about minimalism, conceptual art, video, performances, 
              realist painting, and then Pattern Painting, all of which are neither 
              fish nor fowl and combine or subvert more traditional categories. 
              I even specialized in design as well as craft in that once famous 
              and once influential weekly N.Y. newspaper, The Village Voice.</p>
            <p>That artists I liked in the late '70s were assimilating craft (Joyce 
              Kozloff, et al) and in some cases design traditions (Scott Burton) 
              lead me to their sources and to seeing that these apparently lowly, 
              non-art inspirations were themselves art. In a sense, I was lead 
              back to early modernist, Futurist, Constructivist, and early Bauhaus 
              thinking, which had been conveniently repressed. Why this took place, 
              apparently in the '50s is for another essay. Suffice it to say, 
              that Lessing's 18th century notion that each media must be true 
              to itself, pure and untainted by other art forms, helped sell art 
              that was otherwise too difficult to understand.</p>
            <p>But why my commitment to the problematic of the interstitial? Why 
              do I tend to favor genre-busting art? Genre-busting art is gender-busting 
              and anti-hierarchal. Reality is quite different from how manmade 
              categories divide it up for convenience, control and ownership. 
              Art to reflect reality should be uncanny rather than canny. The 
              either/or must be replaced by the both/and. A person or an object 
              can occupy several different categories simultaneously. Physics 
              may yet prove that two objects can occupy the same space. It's true 
              in art, so why not in Long Island? Why not in life?</p>
            <p>Certainly it can now be proposed that Brancusi&#8217;s pedestals 
              and seating, Noguchi's lamps, and perhaps Oldenburg&#8217;s Bedroom 
              Ensemble lead to Burton's furniture sculptures and R. M. Fischer's 
              lamps and fountains and that these have lead to Andrea Zeitel. Thus 
              primary modernism resurfaced under post-modernism and will survive 
              the inevitable post-modernist eclipse.</p>
            <p> Marek Cecula is a case in point. Cecula is someone I have followed 
              for a long time. He was one of the artists in my 1992 &quot;More 
              Than One&quot; exhibition of production craft, itself a portmanteau 
              concept, at the American Craft Museum. As a collector of modernist 
              dinnerware as well as a critic, I still love his Colorware, a mix-and-match 
              set of black-rimmed solid colors: chartreuse, saturated blue, off-red, 
              and bright yellow. Pop, post-pop, Bauhaus and Wright are some bases 
              touched. Much later, I wrote for American Ceramics about his brilliant 
              Scatology Series sculptures that cover gynecology, AIDS, and the 
              medical side of sanitary porcelain. Last year his one-man show at 
              Garth Clark was a further exploration of the body.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/cecula/mcecula4.jpg" width="318" height="214"></p>
            <p>Like most artists working in New York, Cecula comes from elsewhere, 
              but in his case it is really elsewhere. He was born in Poland, was 
              a kibbutznik in Israel (which is where he learned ceramics), and 
              then worked in a ceramics factory south of Sao Paulo before he ended 
              up in Soho&#8212;in the early days. Cecula is nostalgic about the 
              once palpable artistic climate: anything could happen. And it did. 
              After Poland, Israel and Brazil, New York was the only place he 
              wanted to be.</p>
            <p>One of the important things about Cecula is that he works in three 
              worlds: design, craft and sculpture. Design is still the hand that 
              feeds him, but it is not as if the two worlds are in isolation. 
              As in the larger world, one discipline influences the other. His 
              recent trope of using &quot;found&quot; ceramics and recontextualizing 
              them is an art world strategy. &quot;The Porcelain Carpet Project,&quot; 
              is an even more startling interchange or exchange or synthesis.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/cecula/mcecula2.jpg" width="320" height="214"><img src="images/cecula/mcecula3.jpg" width="229" height="214"></p>
            <p>Timed to coincide with a NSECA clay conference, Cecula&#8217;s 
              largest artwork to date, unless you count his production output, 
              is a floorpiece specifically commissioned by Grand Arts, Kansas 
              City&#8217;s premier nonprofit art space. The Porcelain Carpet as 
              originally conceived and installed was three 12 by 16 foot rectangles 
              each made of 144 plates arranged in grids directly on the floor. 
              In &quot;Phase I,&quot; the industrial produced blanks are blank. 
              In &quot;Phase II,&quot; the black and white image of an actual 
              oriental carpet is superimposed on the array by the wonders of digital 
              photography and printing. &quot;Phase III&quot; offers the final, 
              full-color version. Each plate in &quot;Phase II&quot; and &quot;Phase 
              III&quot; if separated out would only show a fragment of the carpet, 
              photo perfect and illusionistically textured.</p>
            <p>In order to set an example, I should disclose that until last year 
              I was on the advisory committee of Grand Arts but seemed to have 
              missed any meetings, if there were such, that resulted in Cecula&#8217;s 
              commission/residency.</p>
            <p> From September through October a new version of &quot;Phase III&quot; 
              was on exhibit at the new branch of the Garth Clark Gallery in Long 
              Island City, next to the Post Office across the street from P.S.1. 
              In spite of 9/11, Garth Clark, noted ceramics historian and art 
              dealer, and his partner Mark Del Vecchio have stuck to their plan 
              to move their 57th Street gallery storage to Queens and expand by 
              opening a new venue their for larger ceramics. Cecula's &quot;Porcelain 
              Carpet&quot; was featured in the opening exhibition, &quot;Groundswell: 
              The Postindustrial Wave in Ceramic Sculpture.&quot; Here &quot;Phase 
              III&quot;, one corner of which crawled up the wall, became simply 
              &quot;Porcelain Carpet.&quot;</p>
            <p>Cecula is taking the tradition of the industrial ceramic decal 
              one step further, one mile further. Sets could be made in which 
              each plate would be different but that would add up to a larger 
              image. But that is not the point. Most of these dishes are on the 
              floor. They depict a fine oriental rug, but it is a magic carpet 
              you cannot step on. The Porcelain Carpet may be about the dinnerware 
              tradition but it is also about conventions, the body, displacement, 
              and the space within a room. Just because the plates are on the 
              floor doesn't mean you should eat off the floor.</p>
