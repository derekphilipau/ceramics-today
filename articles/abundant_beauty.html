              Dolly Dimples, Baby Thelma, Baby Ruth, Jolly Nellie, and other Circus 
              Fat Folks&#8217; true life obsession with food was, like my own 
              obsession with clay, their deepest joy and the defining passion 
              of their lives. Many of us, men AND women, struggle with &#8220;hungers,&#8221; 
              yearnings for pleasures be it food, love, possessions, control, 
              power. Hunger, in all its metaphorical forms, is part of our personal 
              and public conversation.</p>
            <p> A BRIEF HISTORY</p>
            <p> Whether we approve or disapprove, Circus Fat Folk were part of 
              entertainment history. ABUNDANT BEAUTY, a sculptural series, explores 
              hunger and issues of appearance and identity through images of these 
              historical, professional performers at a time when obesity was a 
              sign of health and prosperity. Found serendipitously on the internet, 
              postcards, souvenirs from circus and carnival sideshows, many photographed 
              by Charles Eisenmann and then Frank Wendt from 1840 to 1930 inspire 
              my clay portraits.</p>

            <p> &#8220; <i>...Revealing of society a century ago, circus women 
              were displayed in a sexually titillating fashion and in erotically 
              charged scenarios, while at the same time being billed (with a big 
              wink) as examples of unblemished purity and domesticity.</i>&#8221; 
              -- writes Dr. Janet Davis, &#8220;<i>The Circus Age: Culture and 
              Society Under the American Big Top</i>&#8221;, University of Texas.</p>
            <p> Traveling carnivals, with Fat Folk as part of Freak Shows, provided 
              a source of entertainment and reflected the values, fears and issues 
              of society at large. When the circus came to town, people traveled 
              miles by wagon or train to see clowns, and trapeze artists, to marvel 
              at the exotic and terrifying animals and to peer at anomalies of 
              nature, like Siamese Twins, Mustached Ladies and Fat Folk.</p>
            <p> Professional performers like <i>Dolly Dimple</i>s Geyer, &#8220;The 
              Most Beautiful Fat Woman in the World, &#8221; <i>Baby Ruth</i> 
              Pontico, &#8220;one of the fattest women ever to appear in the [Barnum 
              &amp; Bailey ] circus&#8221; and <i>Jollie Nellie</i> Terrell , 
              who appears in a cameo appearance in the film noir classic, &#8216;Nightmare 
              Alley&#8217; with Tyrone Power, were happily married. Interviews 
              note that they loved their work, the companionship they found in 
              a haven from strict societal constraints, along with financial opportunities 
              within the carnival environment.</p>
            <p> PROCESS</p>
            <p> Each of my sculptural works was coil built, in white or brown 
              stoneware, with an awareness of the relationship of dainty hands 
              and feet to body mass, the provocative nature of their poses and 
              spirit of expression. It was a sensual experience to round enormous 
              juicy arms, sculpt deeply dimpled elbows, fashion ample thighs with 
              curves of fat over muscle and to persuade the distortion of each 
              face, hidden amidst its multitude of chins.</p>
            <p> On AN UNKNOWN WOMAN, BABY THELMA, DOLLY DIMPLES and most others, 
              rutile oxide was brushed, then wiped off, to accentuate and add 
              a more complex expression. I sculpted their mouths open to imply 
              a voice of hunger beneath the playful facade. In keeping with my 
              handmade Artist Books, which incorporate text, I inscribe obscure 
              messages about hunger and longing. At the leather hard stage, sections 
              are cut, hollowed to approximately one quarter inch thickness and 
              reassembled with slip. In order to capture the character of tinted 
              photographs, a wash of whitened acrylic color barely identifies 
              a dress, corsage, hair bow or shoe after firing. BABY RUTH&#8217;s 
              portrait is a contrast between textured, flecked clay, flatness 
              of fish sauce and the sheen of glaze in her bow.</p>

            <p> Developing works like the URBAN MOTION and ABUNDANT BEAUTY series 
              has been the antithesis of my early work as a fashion illustrator 
              and graphic designer, working with companies like Estee Lauder, 
              Revlon, Max Factor and Helena Rubenstein, as well as fashion magazines. 
              Despite a lifetime of drawing and painting the figure, clay is a 
              new medium. In this medium, I discover the bliss of making. I spent 
              more than a dozen years creating Artist Books about dance, until 
              2003, when I literally dreamed of working in clay and woke to that 
              new direction.</p>
            <p>URBAN MOTION, inspired by Hip Hop, began that dream. In STREET 
              WISE (aka APOLLO) and THE THREE GRACES, mythological clay gods and 
              goddesses masquerade as street. The Graces, Thalia, Euphrosyne, 
              Aglaia, danced to the music of Apollo, symbolized all that was noble, 
              beautiful and pure. They presided over banquets, dances, and other 
              pleasurable social events, and brought joy to gods and mortals. 
              Like the Muses, they endowed artists and poets with the ability 
              to create works of art. Imagine meeting the young jazz musician, 
              who would pose for Thalia, (figure on the left) outside NY&#8217;s 
              Thalia Theater.</p>

            <p>It seems abundantly clear that my direction will continue to be 
              about theater, music, dance, performers and performance. As a daughter 
              of a renowned vaudeville eccentric dancer, the need to entertain 
              seems to be part of my gene pool. Within this realm, I search for 
              a darker, less conventional beauty, contradicting the mainstream, 
              hoping to occasionally challenge the norms of acceptance and comfort.</p>
