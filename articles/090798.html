            <P> All of us have come into contact with decals -- we see the commercial 
              type every day on mugs, plates and other industrial ceramics. Getting 
              these types of images on to a ceramic work is not necessarily that 
              hard. In this feature I would like to have a brief look at some 
              of the issues involved. Those wanting to actually get out there 
              and do their own printing, I would like to refer to some of the 
              technical literature on the subject available in may good technical 
              ceramic books and magazines. You can also check out this really 
              neat <a href="visgirda.html"><b>article by Rimas VisGirda</b></a>,
              who explains his easy decal making process. 
            <P> <B>Decals</B><BR>
              When making decals, ceramic oxides are mixed with a medium into 
              a smooth paste, which is printed onto a transfer paper (usually 
              a gelatin coated paper) with traditional screen printing techniques. 
              When the transfer paper has dried, the decal is ready for use or 
              can be stored indefinitely. The decal is applied by softening in 
              warm water. The gelatinous skin with the embedd inmage releases 
              from the base paper and can be applied to the ceramic ware. It is 
              then fired to 700-750<sup>o</sup> C (1300-1380<sup>o</sup> F), at 
              which temperature the glaze softens just enough to embedd the oxides. 
            <P> The printing is done via a screen, which consists of a fine mesh, 
              stretched on to a frame (usually wood or aluminum). The size of 
              the mesh depends on what sort of results you want to get and also 
              on the mesh size of the oxides in the medium. An image can be painted 
              directly on to the surface of the screen with a suitable paint or 
              shellac, or it might be transferred using a photographic emulsion. 
              However this technique may require access to a special ultraviolet 
              light for curing, although there are methods on the market for home 
              users. Another method is to place a stencil beneath the screen. 
              This saves making multiple screens, as the one screen can be reused 
              with multiple stencils. 
            <P> Once the image has been established, the medium with the pigments 
              is drawn evenly over the mesh and onto the paper surface with a 
              scraper. Scrapers are usually made of a thick slice of rubber held 
              by a wooden handle. 
            <P> <B>Printing on to Tiles</B><BR>
              It's also possible to print directly on to tiles. In this case the 
              whole decal making process becomes redundant and the result is much 
              more immediate. Of course this is only possible on fairly flat surfaces. 
              It would be difficult, if not impossible to print directly on to 
              a mug, or a sculpture!
