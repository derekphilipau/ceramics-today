            <p align="center"><b>The Rascal Ware Foot Fetish, by Georgette Ore 
              (Chapter 5 in the 'Rascal Ware' series)</b></p>
            <p><br>
              Junior Bucks, Mosley Bunkham and Don Pilcher have a collective ceramic 
              experience of about 92 years (the 2 belonging to Mosley) so you&#8217;d 
              think that by now they are immune to cheap tricks and stolen aesthetics. 
              But they are also men and they have a passion for exotic feet. I 
              count my blessings it&#8217;s not for erotic feet. They make no 
              apologies and you don&#8217;t want to press them on the matter because 
              they get very defensive, especially Junior. Since he writes the 
              checks, one needs to know when to drop it.</p>

            <p>Still, the seashell thing. Honest to God, you talk about sucking 
              the hind tit of a foreign culture. The truth is that there are a 
              number of cool things you can do to dress up a pot. Lots of people 
              get a little weak in the knees when they see them&#8230;and I say 
              a little weak in the mind when they use them. Hold your stomach 
              - here&#8217;s a short list: using river stones for the knob on 
              a lid, frying the living bejeesus out of the clay by hanging the 
              work on the bag wall, torching a copper saturated glaze when cooling, 
              adding a marble base and three zeros to the price and double smoking 
              a talc body. The list goes on and you can add your own. (On the 
              other hand, double smoked bacon is pretty fine. You can get some 
              of the best at Vi&#8217;s in Door County.)</p>
            <p>I first saw the seashell stilt on some pots made by Shoji Hamada 
              on Okinawa in the 1960s. I gather it was a common and ancient practice 
              then. Shells do seem like a gift from God to all the potters. They 
              are naturally resistant to high temperatures and wood or salt vapors, 
              sized for an array of pottery shapes, moderately decorative, wildly 
              abundant and free for the taking. If you travel to Florida in February 
              to gather your shells, the trip is in part tax deductible. That&#8217;s 
              the part that seduces Pilcher. In a pinch, Junior will send Mosley 
              out to the kitchen of the local Red Lobster to grab a few dozen 
              shells, remnants from the bouillabaisse. Seashells in the heartland 
              are one of the seldom appreciated aspects of our franchise culture. 
              So what&#8217;s the problem? </p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/chapter5-1.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/chapter5-1.jpg" alt="Rascal Ware" width="244" height="250" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/chapter5-2.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/chapter5-2.jpg" width="262" height="250" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>You can think of it as the heroin problem. Seashell stilts reduce 
              the distance between artistic impulse and aesthetic nirvana to almost 
              nothing. What&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s an aesthetic that requires 
              no practice and allows for almost no evolution or improvement. The 
              first time you use it you have accomplished the ultimate in &#8220;attractive 
              and eye pleasing&#8221; solutions. You&#8217;ll never get any better 
              at it. Further, the stilts cover a multitude of sins like poor glaze 
              application and careless firing. It&#8217;s choosing fortune over 
              finesse. That kind of sloth is addictive. The proof of this tide 
              of addiction is the growing frequency with which potters use shell 
              marks like a hickey on the sides of their jugs. At least on the 
              foot we sneak up on the ultimate, a coda to conclude our knowledge 
              and appreciation of the vessel. But these shell broaches fairly 
              scream, &#8220;I got laid.&#8221; And so they did&#8212;on their 
              side, next to the fire box. </p>

            <p>Pardon my use of the word &#8220;vessel.&#8221; It seems popular 
              to use that word when one needs to pump an argument -- a sort of 
              literary marble base and always worth a few zeros. The fact that 
              the strategy is so common says volumes about our pottery world.</p>
            <p>Going back to my guys and their foot fetishes -- they can&#8217;t 
              give it up. It comes from the &#8220;hunt,&#8221; that too male 
              thing where they will trample the good searching for the perfect. 
              They think it&#8217;s the coolest thing in the world to find an 
              aesthetic Shangri-La, hidden until handled and then, once touched, 
              it lives in their memory like the love of a woman who seldom speaks. 
              That would not be me! </p>
