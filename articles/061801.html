            <p>Lithuanian born American ceramic artist Rimas VisGirda has always had dogs 
              in his life and his ceramics have been influenced by them. For those 
              of you not familiar with his work, please see also <b><a href="visgirda.html">An

            <p><img src="../images/v_gills.gif" width="42" height="47" align="left" alt="S">isGirda, 
              who now lives in Champaign, Illinois, was born in Lithuania. His 
              family arrived in the United States when he was seven, first going 
              to Boston, then to LA, then Sacramento. To him, looking back, it 
              seems like his family always had dogs - they were generally small 
              ones, including a varied assortment of cocker spaniels as well as 
              mixed breeds.</p>
            <p>Ceramics wasn't VisGirda's first choice of profession, initially 
              choosing to do study Physics at Cal State Uni, Sacramento. During 
              this period he took an elective in ceramics there. However, it wasn't 
              until VisGirda had spent some years working as an Associate Physicist 
              in the aerospace industry developing rocket propellants, that he 
              realized that his true passion lay with ceramics. He decided to 
              move to the Sierra foothills to set up a studio pottery with his 
              friend Richard Hotchkiss..</p>
            <p><a href="061801c.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/howcomemydogdontbark_sm.jpg" width="107" height="120" hspace="10" alt="How Come MY Dog Don't Bark When You Come Knockin' on my Door" border="0" align="left"></a>VisGirda's
              first own dog wasn't really his, but rather his girlfriend's at 
              college. She wanted them to have a dog and when she saw an ad in 
              the paper for cute puppies they bought a black one with white toes 
              and a white stripe on his chest. The mother was a German Shepherd. 
              The father wasn't known. They paid $7.50 and took him away. He was 
              about the size of a football. They named him Boston Blackie, (but 
              most people knew him as Boston) - after a 1950's TV series about 
              a detective that drove a hot sports car and had a beautiful girlfriend. 
              Boston wound up being more VisGirda's dog than the girlfriends - 
              he went with VisGirda everywhere, but he always preferred the girls 
              and if given a choice would hang out with them until it was time 
              to go, then he went with his master. He was a handsome dog that 
              grew tall and lean and had the head of a Shepherd with the body 
              of a chunky greyhound. He stayed all black with white toes and a 
              white slash on his chest.</p>
            <p><a href="061801d.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/howcome_back_sm.jpg" width="107" height="120" hspace="10" alt="Back" border="0" align="left"></a>Boston
              accompanied VisGirda to graduate school and got to know all the 
              other students and professors. One day after a Christmas vacation, 
              VisGirda came back to campus to find signs posted on the doors of 
              the art building that read &quot;Boston is a dog not a city&quot; 
              - VisGirda thinks that's when he started using dogs in his work 
              - but it was difficult because Boston was black, so VisGirda used 
              his &quot;artistic license&quot; and changed Boston's color to be 
              appropriate to the situation. Artist and dog lived and worked together 
              for 16 years.</p>
            <p>Many of VisGirda's pieces carry titles inspired by blues and country 
              &amp; western music that he listens to in the studio. For him both 
              types of lyrics tend to expound on the simple, basic things in life 
              and coincide well with the common experiences in his own life, so 
              he often uses song lyrics as titles as they fit in to the visual 
              situation he's depicting.</p>
            <p align="left">Some years passed and in the meantime VisGirda broadened 
              his ceramic knowledge base by doing a Masters program back at his 
              old university of California State. One of his main influences at 
              the time was Robert Arneson, who was teaching just across the river 
              at the University of California. Arneson taught VisGirda the importance 
              to the artist of ideas and concepts, and how artistic expression 
              needs to surface from deep within. Soon after that, VisGirda went 
              on to do an MFA at Washington State University. It was here that 
              VisGirda realized the possibility of expressing narrative on ceramics, 
              in contrast to uniform glazing, e.g. as it was done in Renaissance 
              maiolica. It was also here that VisGirda started teaching a drawing 
              class, that -- of necessity -- honed his own drawing skills. It 
              was from these and <b><a href="visgirda.html">other influences</a></b>
              of the time that VisGirda developed his current narrative, caricature 
              style decoration.</p>
            <p><a href="061801e.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/Dogs_of_Loucky_sm.jpg" width="78" height="113" align="left" border="0"></a>In
              1997 VisGirda and his wife Billie Theide participated in an international 
              porcelain symposium at the Leander 1946 porcelain factory in Loucky 
              in the Czech Republic. They lived in the village, which has a population 
              of about 200, and would walk from their hostel to the factory. It 
              seemed like every house in the village had at least one dog. The 
              dogs that weren't inside would gather early every morning on the 
              dead-end street in front of their hostel where they would meet for 
              about 30 minutes, then go their separate ways for the rest of the 
              day. This experience led to a number of porcelain pieces produced 
              during the symposium, as well as pieces VisGirda made when he got 
              back to his own studio. The porcelain factory owner was also a dog 
              lover and really enjoyed the pieces...</p>
