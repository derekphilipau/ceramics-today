                        in a flowing brown <i>jellaba</i> and peaked gray <i>tarboosh,</i> 
                        Abdelatif Benslimane wanders the narrow lanes of Old Fez, 
                        his eyes darting from wall to column to fountain, his 
                        mouth whispering familiar names. "Fifty points inside

                      <p>This is not the secret patter of a mystic, but rather 
                        the precise terminology of a master craftsman. Benslimane 
                        is a ceramic mosaicist, a <i>zlayji</i> in Moroccan Arabic, 
                        and these are the names of just some of the many patterns 
                        he sees in any short stroll through the old city.</p>

                        of color, its infinite possibilities of design and its 
                        sudden pleasure of discovery&#8212;around a corner at

                        the city gives that it wears two faces at once: an ageless

                        Fez, at the beginning of the 13th century, a survey of 
                        the city ordered by the Almohad ruler al-Nasir Muhammad 
                        (1199-1213) counted 188 ceramic workshops. In the 14th 
                        century, historian Ibn Khaldun noted the desire of wealthy 
                        merchants there "to build great houses and decorate them 
                        with ceramics, mosaics, and arabesques."</span></p>

                        in Muslim Spain, or al-Andalus, <i>zillij</i> reached 
                        artistic heights that have never been surpassed, evident 
                        especially in the Alcazar and Alhambra palaces. As Arab 
                        historian Leo Africanus noted, the eventual expulsion 
                        of the Muslims from Spain in 1492 benefited Fez: It provided 
                        the city with an influx not only of great craftsmen, but 
                        also a new class of patrons.</span></p>

                  a <i>zlayji</i> starts with a call from an architect whose client 
                  has asked for a mosaic panel measuring, let us say, two meters 
                  (78") square, to decorate a new home's salon. Any traditional 
                  design and color scheme are possible, but the space and its 
                  proportions impose certain overall constraints: A 50-point star, 
                  for example, needs room for its 24- and 12-point satellite stars, 
                  a common Islamic pattern that Burkhardt called "a shimmering 
                  planetarium, in which each line starts from a center and leads 
                  to a center."</span></p>

                  <i>furmah,</i> found in <i>zillij</i> work. Star-based patterns 
                  are identified by their number of points&#8212;<i>'itnashari</i> 
                  for 12, <i>'ishrini</i> for 20, <i>arba' wa 'ishrini</i> for 
                  24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. 
                  The so-called <i>khamsini,</i> for 50 points, and <i>mi'ini,</i> 
                  for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, 
                  because geometry requires that the number of points of any star 
                  in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences 
                  based on five and on eight.)</span></p>

                  elements such as strapping, braids, or "lanterns." And then 
                  there are all the non-star patterns&#8212;honeycombs, webs, 
                  steps and shoulders, and checkerboards. The Alhambra's interlocking 
                  <i>zillij</i> patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration 
                  for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist M.C. Escher.</span></p>

                  which are used as the center of the star patterns, to chevrons 
                  and triangles, hexagons and octagons, lozenges and diamonds, 
                  and curvilinear and rectilinear strapwork. Organic shapes go

                  consisting of 32 different shapes in eight colors. He works 
                  backward from these numbers to calculate how many square, glazed 
                  "mother tiles," each 10 centimeters (4") on a side, he must

                  frequently fills Benslimane's larger orders. His workshop is 
                  in the old city's busy Bab al-Khokha quarter, and on this day 
                  he and his assistants are cutting <i>furmah</i> called <i>qamarshun,</i> 
                  whose shape is a Greek cross with tapered ends, that measure 
                  about one centimeter (3/8") end to end.</span></p>

                  <i>qamarshun</i> as a template to ink outlines onto a square 
                  mother tile. Striking it with a chisel-headed hammer against 
                  his anvil's steel tongue, he scores lightly along the drawn 
                  lines and snaps out the rough shape with his hand. He has cut 
                  along sixteen separate edges, and not one has fractured other 
                  than where he intended.</span></p>
                <p><span id="lBody" class="pageTemplateBody">He hands the piece 
                  off to the finish cutter sitting cross-legged beside him before 
                  an anvil with a tongue of terra cotta, which provides the softer 
                  striking surface required for the finer end-work. The finisher 
                  cleans up the shape and bevels the back side so that only the 
                  <i>furmah's</i> glazed edges will touch when set against another

                  and break more often, so about 80 of these is considered a good 
                  day's output. Because many lengths of strapwork are required 
                  in any design using that motif, a simple 10-point star pattern&#8212;the 
                  same one found in the Bou Inaniyya <i>madrasa</i>&#8212;would 
                  today cost more than $1500 for a single square-meter panel.</span></p>

                  of the art of tile cutting. A master <i>nqaash</i> has cut the 
                  calligraphic word <i>Allah</i> (God) less than two centimeters 
                  across, the size of a dime, from a green tile, and also a space 
                  in which to inlay it within a white tile medallion. The curving 
                  edges of the inset and its background match perfectly. From 
                  that center, the pattern expands infinitely to cover the wall

                  is scraped off negative areas of the mother tile to leave behind 
                  a shiny pattern in low relief. This serves best to highlight

                  off the <i>zillij</i> work on walls, most often in black glaze.

                        diamonds, thus giving the pattern its full count of twenty-four. 
                        Radiating around this center is a burst of evenly spaced 
                        eight-pointed star pieces called <i>dirhams.</i></span></p>

                        star piece coordinates with interspacing elements until 
                        the puzzle is complete. Because the back side of each

                        this particular project, Rashidi has been at work for 
                        three days. He is confident that the nearly 5000-piece 
                        layout, looking from the blind back side like nothing 
                        more than an irregular relief map, is exact in color and 
                        design, down to the last fingernail-sized <i>furmah.</i></span></p>

                        Their symmetry is perfect and their spacing is precise. 
                        Such perfection is not reached by creating them piece 
                        by piece."</span></p>

                        firming of the pattern, which he accomplishes by gingerly 
                        walking over the layout to push the pieces toward the 
                        center, Rashidi sprays a powdery cement over the design. 
                        The next day he will apply a seven-centimeter-thick (3") 
                        concrete backing that, when dry, will allow the mosaic 
                        to be attached to a wall as a single panel. Only then 
                        will the brilliance and complexity of the design join 
                        the artistic firmament of the <i>zlayji's</i> universe.</span></p>

                        in everything I make," he says. By this, he means being 
                        true to his metier and faithful to the traditions of his 
                        craft. On one occasion, after a client was late in paying, 
                        Benslimane sold his new car to help his assistants&#8212;with 
                        whom he had just completed a particularly fine piece of

                        of the Sacrifice. To this day he drives the old clunker 
                        that replaced that car.</span></p>

                        craftsmen feel so well compensated by the respect accorded 
                        them that they are unashamed of their otherwise modest 
                        economic status. "Fez is not," he wrote, "the city of 
                        mystery, as has often been said, but rather the city of 
                        good sense and good living"&#8212;values that are embodied
