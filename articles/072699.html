        Bastarache</b></a> fills us in on the dangers of cadmium in the making 
        of ceramics. The toxicology of ceramic materials is often underestimated 
        and sometimes neglected in our ceramics institutions. Many thanks to Edouard 
        for this contribution to ceramic toxicolgy. 
      <p> Compounds: 
      <ul>
        <li><b><font color="#000080">cadmium oxide </font></b> 
        <li><b><font color="#000080">cadmium carbonate </font></b> 
        <li><b><font color="#000080">cadmium chloride </font></b> 
        <li><b><font color="#000080">cadmium sulfate </font></b> 
        <li><b><font color="#000080">cadmium sulfide </font></b> 
      </ul>
      <p> <b>Uses:</b><br>
        The metal is used in electroplating, in solder for aluminium, as a constituent 
        of easily fusible alloys, as a deoxidizer in nickel plating, in process 
        engraving, in cadmium-nickel batteries, and in reactor control rods. Cadmium 
        compounds are employed as TV phosphors, as pigments in glazes and enamels, 
        in dyeing and printing, and in semi-conductors and rectifiers. 
      <p> <b>Exposure:</b><br>
        Inhalation 
      <p> <b>Toxicology: </b><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Cadmium oxide fume is a severe pulmonary irritant; cadmium dust is 
          a less potent irritant than cadmium fume because it has a larger particle 
          size. Chronic exposure is associated with nephrotoxicity. Several inorganic 
          cadmium compounds cause malignant tumors in animals. 
        <li>Inhalation exposure to high levels of cadmium fumes or dust is intensely 
          irritating to respiratory tissue. Particle size appears to be a more 
          important determinant of toxicity than chemical form. However, most 
          acute intoxications have been caused by inhalation of cadmium fume at 
          concentrations that did not provide sufficient warning symtoms of irritation. 
          Concentrations of fume responsible for fatalities have been 40 to 50 
          mg/m3 for 1 hour or 9 mg/m3 for 5 hours. There has been non-fatal cases 
          at lower concentrations. Pulmonary symptoms and clinical signs reflect 
          lesions ranging from nasopharyngeal and bronchial irritation to pulmonary 
          edema with also possibly headache, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, 
          and diarrhea. Among survivors, the subsequent course is unpredictable; 
          most cases resolve slowly, but respiratory symptoms may linger for several 
          weeks, and impairment of pulmonary function may persists for months. 
        <li>Long-term inhalation exposure at low levels leads to decreased lung 
          function and emphysema. 
        <li>Chronic exposure to cadmium results in renal damage which may continue 
          to progress even after exposure ceases. 
        <li>Other consequences of cadmium exposure are : 
          <ul>
            <li>anemia 
            <li>yellow discoloration of the teeth 
            <li>rhinitis 
            <li>occasional ulceration of the nasal septum 
            <li>damage to the olfactory nerve 
            <li>anosmia 
          </ul>
        <li>Chronic exposure to high levels of cadmium in food has caused bone 
          disorders, including osteoporosis and osteamalacia. Long term ingestion, 
          by a Japanese population, of water and food contaminated with cadmium, 
          was associated with a crippling condition, &quot;itai-itai&quot; (ouch-ouch) 
          disease. The affliction is characterized by pain in the back and joints, 
          osteomalacia (adult rickets), bone fractures, and occasional renal failure, 
          and most often affects women with multiple risk factors such as multiparity 
          and poor nutrition. 
        <li>Occupational exposure to cadmium has been implicated in a significant 
          increase of lung cancer. The IARC has determined that there is sufficient 
          evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of cadmium and cadmium compounds. 
          It also appears that cadmium has the capability to alter genetic materials, 
          particularly chromosomes. 
        <li>The 1995 ACGIH threshod limit value-time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) 
          for elemental cadmium and compounds as Cd is 0.01 mg/m3 for total particulate 
          dust (while it is 10mg/m3 for titanium dioxide in Quebec); or 0.002 
          mg/m3 for the respirable fraction of dust,there is an A 2 suspected 
          human carcinogen designation for both forms. 
        <li>The urinary excretion of cadmium itself bears no known relationship 
          to the severity or duration of exposure and is only the confirmation 
          of absorption.Absorbed cadmium is retained in the body to a large extent, 
          and excretion is very slow. 
      </ul>
      The important thing is your level of exposure to cadmium, it may vary if 
      you are a pottery factory worker, a teacher, a full-time studio potter or 
      a part-time. It certainly depends also on the amount used over a given period 
      of time. In the wet state, these compounds are certainly much less hazardous 
      than as dust ( route of entry being inhalation). Factories can afford the 
      monitoring of cadmium exposure but it is not the same for artists and craftpersons. 
      So good housekeeping of your studio is important. Avoidance of processes 
      generating unnecessary dust is also important, and the wearing of an approved 
      dust mask when the exposure seems hazardous is mandatory.
