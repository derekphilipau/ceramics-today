              So Hard to Use</font><br>
              by Brian Crocker</strong></b></font><b></b> <P><FONT SIZE=2>How much plaster should you mix? This requires 
              only a little mathematics. Having set up the model on a base with 
              the cottle around it, take all the outside dimensions, length, width 
              and height, preferably in centimeters, multiply these to get cubic 
              centimeters and this will give you the volume of mixed plaster you 
              require and from that the percentage [%] of water. Then using the 
              above list , the kg's of plaster.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><img src="../images/plaster2.jpg" alt="Two-piece Plaster Mold" width="169" height="170" hspace="3" align="left">This 
              is not an accurate method but near enough, there should be plenty 
              for the Mold and some left over, it is very frustrating to pour 
              a Mold and find that you do not have enough mixed plaster. An accurate 
              calculation is quite possible but a lot more involved but not really 
              necessary in a studio.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Weigh out the water (%) into the water bucket pour 
              it into the mixing bucket, weigh out the plaster into the dry plaster 
              bucket and fluff it up with your hands or use a sieve and pick out 
              any lumpy pieces. There shouldn't be any lumps if the plaster is 
              fresh.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Make sure &quot;all&quot; the equipment is ready and 
              easy to reach [ don't forget to plug in the electric drill ] . Danger 
              you are using water near electricity.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><I>From this time on, the mixing, plaster debubbling, 
              pouring of the plaster and final release of the Mold is controlled 
              by time. </I></FONT></P>
            <P><I><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Sequence is as Follows,</FONT></B></I></P>
            <DIR><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><B> </b></font></i><b></b> 
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>1.</b></font><FONT SIZE=2>&#9;Set the timer to 
              6 minutes, ( this is the time you have to mix the plaster, debubble 
              and scoop out the bubbles ) <B>slowly sprinkle</B> the plaster into 
              the water, N.B. plaster into water,, don't just dump it in, then 
              with the mixer, a paddle or your hand, cream the plaster into the 
              water try to avoid making bubbles. When nice and smooth pick up 
              the bucket by the handle and rattle it on the floor and as the bubbles 
              rise, &quot;watch your timer&quot;, stop and scoop them off and 
              discard them into a paper lined rubbish bin... <B><I>Not</i></B><I><b> 
              </b><B>down the sink, it causes &quot;solid drain pipes</B>&quot;.</i></font></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>2.</b>&#9;Set the timer to 3 minutes, ( this is 
              the time you have to pour the mixed plaster into the Mold and debubble 
              (vibrate) the Mold ). Pour in the plaster and try not to pour in 
              any bubbles, if you can, have an assistant to scoop them out. Pour 
              slowly and down as close to the surface as possible and onto a position 
              away from the model surface so that the plaster flows gently up 
              to and around the model. </FONT></P>
            <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></FONT> 
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>As soon as the model is covered by about 10 mm of 
              plaster stop and give the cottles a number of taps (vibrate) on 
              all sides,, <B>gently</B> to release more bubbles, if too violent 
              you might loosen the cottle, now scoop out the bubbles.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><I>A loose cottle is an experience you can do without. 
              Having plaster leaking out all over the bench tends to foster a 
              feeling of helpless panic.</I></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Carefully finish pouring the plaster, still in a position 
              away from the model.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>3.</b>&#9;Set the timer to 2 minutes, and finish 
              debubbling, this will bring you up to a total of 11 minutes from 
              start to finish, during this time the plaster is thickening and 
              it is difficult to release more bubbles and there is a possibility 
              of spoiling the new Mold.</FONT></P>
            <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></FONT> 
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>You may have noticed that I keep mentioning bubbles, 
              they are the enemy of the Mold maker. a few on the surface or in 
              the body of the Mold are OK but if they stick to the model surface 
              your work can be spoiled. Don't try to fill holes with plaster later, 
              throw the Mold away and start again from the start, soaping, polishing 
              etc.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>4.</b>&#9;If the model is convex in shape ( a bottle, 
              vase, sprig or similar ) set the timer to 30 minutes and leave the 
              plaster to set. After this time the plaster will have reached 40°C 
              or more [ it feels warm ]. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>For the next 4 minutes it will be at it's maximum 
              expansion and will have very very slightly moved away from the model 
              by about 1 to 5 thousandths of an inch.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now you can remove the cottles and <B>gently tap</B> 
              the top plaster of the Mold with a soft rubber hammer but be very 
              careful the plaster is only as firm as a matured cheese, also tap 
              the sides of the Mold and the bottom of the model then try to shake 
              the model free, ‘as a last resort use very thin soft timber wedges 
              coated in soap, place them around the joint line and push them with 
              your finger. Or use compressed air at the joint line.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>5.</b>&#9;In the case of a concave model ( a bowl 
              or similar ) leave the plaster Mold with the model inside in a 
              warm dry place for 24 hours or more . You can blow air over it with 
              an electric fan but make sure the air does not blow on the one surface 
              all the time, move the Mold often to present a new area to the 
              fan.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>It is important to ensure that the air is not blasted 
              onto the Mold it should be gentle and not warmer than 35 to 40°C. 
              If only the outer surface of the Mold becomes dry through ‘forced 
              drying' the inside will take longer to dry, it needs a capillary 
              action to draw off the inside moisture. When you feel the Mold 
              and it is not cool but at ambient temperature [ if ambient is not 
              too cold ] it is time to release the model as in <b>4.</b> .</FONT></P>
            <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></FONT></DIR>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>If the plaster will not release, the model may be 
              undercut at some part,, or there is some area of the model that 
              was not soaped enough,, or the wet plaster may have been poured 
              in so forcefully that the soaped surface has been washed off and 
              the plaster has stuck to the model.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>In cases where there is a &quot;hang up&quot; gentle 
              persuasion must be used then increasing to bruit - force if necessary 
              (you may ruin the Mold). <I>But never forget the power of compressed 
              air, at the joint line.</i></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>At first this all may sound complicated, but the above 
              methods are some of the basics used by many Professional Mold Makers 
              every working day in production Potteries.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>I must emphasize that these are basics, and not the 
              complete answer to Mold making, it is a profession that takes many 
              years to learn. There are several good books on the subject, enquire 
              at a College where it is taught as a <B>Professional Subject</B>. 
              Not just part of another course.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Give it a try, you may be like many Potters who have 
              success, if not, you will be sure to learn by your mistakes.</FONT></P>
