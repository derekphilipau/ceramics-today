                  Figure Painting of Gods and Heroes</h3>
                <p align="left">Pottery painters in Attica were the first to paint 
                  narrative scenes from popular myths about their Gods and Heroes; 
                  episodes from Homer's Epics, the Iliad and Odyssey, featuring 
                  such gods as Apollo or Dionysos and heroes such as Achilles 
                  or Herakles and his Twelve Labours or Exploits. </p>
                <p align="left">Unlike the strange deities of the Egyptians, Mesopotamians 
                  and Persians, the Greek Gods and Heroes were believed to be 
                  human in form though larger, more powerful and physically perfect 
                  etc. Images or paintings of Gods or Heroes could therefore be 
                  based on human models. </p>
                <p align="left">This is the key to why figure drawing, painting 
                  and sculpture in Greece improved so dramatically during the 
                  6th and 5th centuries. The realism, life-like and three-dimensional 
                  qualities achieved were beyond that of any other civilization 
                  hitherto.</p>
                <p align="left">Competition between artists to achieve the most 
                  natural representation of a God or a Hero reached fever pitch 
                  by the early 5th century.</p>

                  on orange clay, ca. 600-575BC BM</font><br>
                  Athenian painters copied this black-figure style from Corinth 
                  but, instead of the Oriental monsters, animals and birds motifs, 
                  preferred to develop further their own narrative style using 
                  Greek Gods, Heroes and monsters. The superior quality of their 
                  clay, pigment, and decoration and firing techniques quickly 
                  enabled the Athenian artists to overtake those of Corinth. This 
                  jug shows a rich black vitrified slip paint and also the matt 
                  grape red iron slip.<br clear-all>

                  This detail of the head of the <a href="gorgons.html">Medusan 
                  Gorgon</a> shows how these Greek artists endowed their figures 
                  with mood and character by means of scratched lines in black 
                  slip. Monotony was avoided by the use of different poses, gestures, 
                  and expressions to render emotion and clarify the narrative 
                  action.

                <h3>The Finest (Mature) Black-Figure Painting ca. 540-520BC.</h3>
                <div align="left">From 600 BC on, Athens increasingly became the 
                  dominant center for Greek pottery, eventually exporting its 
                  ware throughout the Mediterranean world. It was during this 
                  period that the practice of signing of pots by potters and painters 
                  first became common. The overall finish and high quality of 
                  Attic pots was commonplace by the later 6th century BC. The 
                  drawing on Greek ware of this period is also usually of the 
                  highest quality. Always an inexhaustible mine of information 
                  for scholars on Greek life, literature and thought, the repertoire 
                  of subjects greatly expanded to include scenes from everyday 
                  life as well as the standard heroic and mythological themes.</div>

                  after some heroic exploit: hunting, fighting, carrying off women, 
                  and cattle rustling etc. There are many tales. The pot is signed 
                  by the Painter Exekias. Our particular interest is the quality 
                  of the slip painting.<br>

                  Closer detail: The dog greets one of his masters.</font><br>
                  The Athenians retained the Corinthian use of animal friezes 
                  for decoration until c. 550 BC, when the great Attic painters, 
                  among them Exekias and the Amasis Painter, developed a Greek 
                  narrative scene decoration and perfected the classical black-figure 
                  style. Corinth and Athens were the most important studios producing 
                  black-figure pottery but there were others in Sparta and some 
                  of the Greece colonies.</p>

                  The fine detail of the helmet and armour can be seen here. All 
                  of this produced by scratched lines in a black slip. <br>
                  This could provide ideas for many slip decorators, couldn't 
                  it? </p>

                  Attic black figured Kylix 6th c. BC.</font><br>
                  This is a typical drinking cup or disk - the kylix. Decorated 
                  both inside and outside with a variety of scenes. The foot and 
                  hollow stem can be seen and painted around the outside of the 
                  bowl are two winged monsters and a charioteer. Of particular 
                  interest here is the introduction of white slip in attic black-figure 
                  painting. It was not easy to use. If thick it often peeled off. (see 
                  Potter's Notes later on.)</p>
                <p align="left"><a href="images/greek/ch69007s.gif"><img src="images/greek/ch69007th.gif" width="46" height="50" alt="" border="0" align="LEFT" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">035a 
                  Inside bowl decoration of Attic black figured Kylix 6th c.BC.</font><br>
                  Inside the bowl of this drinking cup is this beautiful piece 
                  of black-figure decoration showing the God Dionysos sailing 
                  the Seas. Climbing around the mast is a grape vine - suitably 
                  fully laden for the God of Wine. The water is filled with a 
                  school of dolphins playing. The disposition of each object within 
                  the circular form has been well considered and carefully balanced. 
                  We know the name of the painter, Exekias, living in the mid-sixth 
                  century BC. <br clear-all>

                  Detail of center</font><br>
                  Here we can see the fine detail in the figure of the God. He 
                  is shown dressed and crowned like a king. The boat, dolphins, 
                  grapevine, and sail are each superbly delineated. Technically, 
                  there is perhaps one defect; the poor fit of the matt white 
                  slip which originally covered the sail. Much has rubbed or flaked 
                  off. It appears to have been painted over the black vitreous 
                  slip. (Read potter's notes)

                  Attic Black-Figure Hydria: ca.520-500BC ht 22.5in.</font><br>
                  A Hydria is the Greek name for a pot with three handles. Two 
                  for lifting and one for pouring. This pot was used for fetching 
                  water from the local fountain. The painting illustrates this. 
                  Under a portico, young women are filling their pots with water 
                  from these ornamental fountains. Athenian pottery of the 6th 
                  century BC often features such narrative scenes composed of 
                  black figures painted on a light red inset background panel, 
                  while the surrounding vase surface is a deep, lustrous black. 
                  As in the previous example, when white slip often tends to flake 
                  off.<br>

                  Closer detail: showing a few problems</font><br>
                  This detail shows up more clearly two defects most potters are 
                  aware of: (1.)The black slip was probably too dry when the lines 
                  were scratched through - the edges cracked and the lines are 
                  rough and (2.)White slip is flaking off - probably applied too 
                  thickly (see Potter's Notes later on).

                  Tiny funeral oil flask ca.500BC ht:11.5cm</font><br>
                  This is typical of the vast mass-produced market for small ( 
                  five inches high) lekythoi, that contained the oil used in a 
                  funeral ceremony. This one has lost the funnel mouth at the 
                  neck, but is otherwise complete. From a potter's point of view 
                  it has considerable interest. The rough basic hollow shape was 
                  thrown on a potter's wheel. Unlike a more prestigious item, 
                  where more time and care would be taken, this little pot was 
                  one of many being made and decorated at speed in a day or two. 
                  This is repetition pottery.

                  When leather-hard, it was turned horizontally on a lathe (exactly 
                  like wood turning) to the required form. Underneath the center 
                  of the foot is a small hole made by the center spike of the 
                  lathe. Normally you can't see this in a museum. The black slip 
                  line banding was quickly brushed on whilst still on the lathe.<br clear-all>

                  neck shows where the cup-like funnel would have been. The various 
                  motifs in the banding patterns around the shoulder show all 
                  the signs of haste and a need to simplify; evidence of mass-production.<br clear-all>

                <h3>Potter's Notes (1) on ... Greek Black-figure Painting Technique<br>
                </h3>
                <ul>
                  <li> <strong>The Origins:</strong> A technique of using a dark 
                    brown-black slip for painting, was used by the potters of 
                    the Aegean all through the 2nd millennium BC, refined and 
                    improved over a long period by observation and trial and error. 
                    Look at the Cretan and Mycenaean examples. This Attic Geometric 
                    pot of the 8th-7th centuries BC is differently decorated but 
                    the body and the slip are little changed. But a Corinthian 
                    pot of about 600BC shows much more sophisticated black-figure 
                    ware. Building on much of this the potters of Attica carried 
                    the black-figure style to perhaps the highest state of perfection 
                    as seen on this 5th century Attic Black-Figure pot. This superb 
                    black-figure painting is the result of a combination of even 
                    more careful selection and preparation of materials, expert 
                    decorators, efficient updraft kilns (T3) and well-controlled 
                    firings. </li>
                  <li> The clay bodies used were mostly locally refined red earthenware 
                    clays which fired orange or brick red at about 950&deg;Centigrade. 
                  </li>
                  <li> Pots were thrown on a wheel, in pieces if necessary, then 
                    joined together with slip. Handles were molded separately 
                    and fixed on last, before decorating </li>
                  <li> When leather-hard, many small pots were also turned horizontally 
                    on a lathe to refine the thickness and shape. A wash of yellow 
                    ochreous clay was then brushed on to produce a richer terracotta 
                    color Much can be seen in this small mass-produced funeral 
                    oil pot. The underneath of the foot is paler and has no shine. 
                    At the center is the small hole caused when turning on a lathe. 
                  </li>
                  <li> <strong>The Black Vitreous Slip: </strong>This was achieved 
                    using a local red (iron rich)clay, often the same clay as the 
                    body but with added soda or potash (alkali flux) in some form. 
                  </li>
                  <li> <strong>Characteristics of slip:</strong> Small particle 
                    size - achieved by levigation rather than grinding; sufficient 
                    alkali to cause the slip to begin to melt at about 900&deg;Centigrade 
                    - this came from soluble soda or potash minerals, maybe from 
                    plant ash. Urine is also thought to have been used to improve 
                    the brushing quality. The slip was evaporated to concentrate 
                    the flux minerals and to produce a thick smooth slip for brush 
                    painting. </li>
                  <li> <strong>The firing process:</strong> This was the key to 
                    achieving a fired pot with buff to red body, smooth but somewhat 
                    porous, decorated with brush painting in a dense shiny black (vitreous)slip. 
                  </li>
                  <li> <strong>The Method :</strong> A red bodied pot decorated 
                    with the &quot;red clay slip + alkali paint&quot; is fired 
                    in a wood fired kiln. When the temperature reaches 800&deg;C 
                    the vents are closed and probably enough different or damp 
                    fuel used to make the kiln become smoky (reduced atmosphere) 
                    and short of oxygen but allowing the temperature to still 
                    rise slowly. The red iron oxide in the body and the slip changes 
                    to the (black)iron oxide (containing less oxygen). Of course, 
                    this change cannot be seen in a red hot kiln!<br>
                    <br>
                    The smoky atmosphere continues until the time the temperature 
                    has gone beyond 900&deg;C when the alkali and the black iron 
                    in the painting slip will begin to cause this clay slip to 
                    melt, producing a shiny surface. <br>
                    <br>
                    When about 950&deg;C.is reached, the temperature is then allowed 
                    to drop to below 800&deg;C. whilst the smoky (reduced) atmosphere 
                    continues. By this time the vitreous slip will have cooled 
                    sufficiently to become an impervious glassy film. <br>
                    <br>
                    After dropping below 800&deg;C. the dampers are opened to 
                    allow enough air in to clear the smoky atmosphere. Although 
                    this is still at red heat and cannot be seen, the black iron 
                    oxide present throughout the porous clay body absorbs more 
                    oxygen and returns to its original stable state of RED iron 
                    oxide. However, the black iron oxide in the vitreous slip 
                    is now trapped in a glassy film. It cannot re-absorb any oxygen, 
                    so remains as BLACK iron oxide. <br>
                    <br>
                    When the kiln and pots are cool the body becomes the orange-red-brown 
                    of common fired earthenware clay, but the dull brown iron 
                    slip, thickly painted on, has been transformed into a lustrous 
                    black paint.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Practical points to bear in mind:</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>1. Painting Slip</strong>. Test various red clay slips. 
                    A slow but simple way of obtaining a fine particled slip is 
                    by thinning a pourable red slip with an extra quarter or half 
                    of its volume of water. You will need to make up a small bucketful 
                    of slip to test. Allow to stand for a while when the coarser 
                    particles will have settled out, then take off a jug full 
                    of slip from the top layer and evaporate it until it becomes 
                    thick enough to be a brushable paint. <br>
                    <br clear-all>
                    <strong>2. Flux material</strong>. Probably the simplest alkali 
                    to add is soda ash, but you can try other soluble materials 
                    containing soda or potash. Again you will need to experiment 
                    to find the best amount to add. Try a teaspoonful of soda 
                    ash to a 1/2 pint of slip to start with. Dissolve it first 
                    in a very small amount of hot water, then add and stir the 
                    slip thoroughly.<br>
                    <br clear-all>
                    <strong>3. The matt purple slip:</strong> <br>
                    This <a href="images/greek/ch032a">dry-looking purple</a> 
                    was produced using a slip paint made from a high iron ore 
                    mineral or clay but with no flux added. The iron ore mineral 
                    Crocus Martis is worth trying to obtain this color<br>
                    <br clear-all>
                    <strong>4. The matt white slip:</strong> <br>
                    Occasionally used. It could be any iron-free white clay. The 
                    problem of white slip flaking off , which is often seen, happens 
                    because natural clays which fire white are usually more refractory 
                    than common red clay so tend not to fit too well on red clay, 
                    especially if painted rather thickly.<br>
                    <a name="PotNote1"></a> <br clear-all>
                    <strong>5. Re-oxidised black slip:</strong> <br>
                    Sometimes through thinness of slip application, lack of flux 
                    or by accidental flame-flashing the black slip re-oxidises; 
                    becoming RED instead of black when cold. <br>
                    [1] Ringed area showing re-oxidized &quot;black&quot; slip 
                    on the right side of shoulder. This change to red is especially 
                    obvious here on such a wide band of slip<br>
                    [2] Color lost on horses legs - probably thin slip, maybe 
                    not enough flux either.<br>
                    [3] Fingers are part oxidized - probably brush stroke became 
                    very thin. Most of the edges of the black slip clothing have 
                    oxidized, presumably thin. Notice that the scratched lines 
                    cut through the inner (thicker?) area of slip are sharp, with 
                    no re-oxidised edges. </li>

                  figures were painted in glossy black pigment as silhouettes 
                  on the orange-red surface of the vase; details were added largely

                  the Berlin painter</font><br>
                  This painting is by a pottery painter known only as <strong>Berlin</strong> 
                  because of the superb quality of his painting style recognized 
                  first on amphora f2160 in the Berlin museum. It illustrates 
                  the apparently simple but in reality momentous change that occurred 
                  in Greek painting around 500BC. as artists continued to explore 
                  ways of representing figures more naturally; they discovered 
                  a new way of drawing. The closer detail of the feet in the next 
                  image shows the result of these experiments.</p>
                <p align="left"><a href="images/greek/ch616s.jpg"><img src="images/greek/ch616th.jpg" width="51" height="75" alt="Click for detail" border="0" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">041a 
                  Detail of painting</font><br>
                  The painted view of each foot is different. The right foot is 
                  seen from the traditional side view. The left foot is seen from 
                  the front. In doing so Greek artists discovered &quot;foreshortening&quot; 
                  - a way of suggesting spatial distance in two dimensions. From 
                  the front of the toes to the leg and ankles is perhaps 5-6inches 
                  back. This way of suggesting depth on a flat surface was a new 
                  discovery. It was the beginning of a quite new a way of drawing 
                  or painting a figure, a believably naturalistic representation 
                  of the human body on a flat surface.</p>

                  which also illustrates this great achievement of Greek painting. 
                  Around 500 BC Greek artists had abandoned the convention of 
                  using only profile views and began to use three-quarter frontal 
                  poses, as well as foreshortening. Their technique of figure 
                  drawing would become the basis of the Western European style 
                  of painting.</p>

                  is a sense of rapid, often violent, movement. This new style 
                  of movement and naturalism and space in painting is now developing 
                  fast.</p>

                  Since most of the ornamentation on Greek pottery was narrative 
                  rather than purely decorative, such technical advantages were 
                  of utmost importance when naturalism in figure painting was 
                  becoming the prime aim.<br clear-all>
                  From the late 6th to the late 4th century BC. most of the more 
                  important pieces were painted in this new style.</p>

                  This is a detail of the full figure of Achilles painted on this

                  However, we know him only by the name &quot;the Achilles Painter", 
                  who worked around 450BC. What would a colored mural painting 
                  in this style have been like? We know they existed, they were

                  Calyx Krater - figures on white slip</font><br>
                  This last technique shows how the pottery decorators longed 
                  to have the freedom to paint like mural painters on a plaster 
                  surface. The painting on this flower-shaped vase or krater started 
                  out as a band of red figure decoration surrounded by the shiny 
                  black slip background. But the flat center band was painted 
                  with a thin even layer of white slip. Generally this survived 
                  quite well. On this an outline drawing of the figures was painted 
                  in red or black slip and then fired. Finally a gouache type 
                  paint probably similar to that used by the mural painters produced 
                  the subtle naturalistic colored effects seen on all the following 
                  images. Sadly time, wear and tear and damp have worn away much 
                  of the brightest color</p>

                    In this reconstruction, I have joined together both views 
                    of the painting on this pot; it is the complete scene. On 
                    the left, the dead woman gazes across at her own shade, now 
                    a Muse, or Goddess of Music and Poetry, in the Afterworld. 
                    Her spirit is indicated by the bird. It is difficult not to 
                    be affected by the mood of gentle sadness which the Achilles 
                    Painter created sometime around 450BC. </p>

                  has been achieved. The relaxed, languid, even sad, figure, is 
                  completely convincing. A mourner stands on the left. Although 
                  in poor condition, sufficient has survived to see the quality 
                  of the drawing and the remains of the post-firing color that 
                  was added. The blue color is probably the same finely ground

                  line drawing until perhaps the 15th century in Europe during 
                  the Italian Renaissance. Since no easel paintings or wall murals 
                  have survived from classical Greece, contemporary ceramic decoration 
                  gives us a glimpse of what Greek wall painting must have been 
                  like in the 5th century BC. This is why Greek pottery has such 
                  a special place in the history of Art - and European painting 
                  in particular.</p>

                <h3><b>Potter's Notes (2) on ...&nbsp;</b><b>The Absence of Colored 
                  Glazes</b></h3>
                <p><strong>Some Thoughts:</strong> It perhaps comes as a surprise 
                  to realize that, having become so proficient in the complex 
                  process of making and firing the shiny black vitreous slip, 
                  Greek potters were never interested in using colored glazes 
                  on their pots. </p>
                <div align="left"> 
                  <p><strong>No interest in Persian Glazes or Frit Paste Colors:</strong> 
                    As inveterate travelers they must have been well aware of 
                    the colorful ceramic products in contemporary Egypt and Persia. 
                    <strong>Alkaline Glazes were probably thought brash and foreign; 
                    and certainly not easy to control:</strong> The sharp refined 
                    lines of Greek drawing would probably not have been possible 
                    using any contemporary frits and &quot;glazes&quot; then available. 
                  </p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>The Greek Ceramic Style:</strong> Classical Greek terracotta 
                  pottery and ceramic painting had by the fifth century BC. developed 
                  as far as it could. The spurt of invention and experiment in 
                  Greek ceramics had run its course for the time being. They had 
                  perfected a ceramic painting system using buffs, browns, dull 
                  purples and white slip plus a lustrous vitreous black slip on 
                  the terracotta or buff colored clay. Colored glazes and other 
                  developments would have to wait for later pottery innovators.</p>
                <p><strong>The last intriguing questions:</strong> Perhaps they 
                  simply didn't choose to develop colored glazes in ceramics. 
                  It is possible they were considered un-Greek. No wall paintings 
                  have survived so we cannot really know how softly - or richly 
                  - colored were their wall-paintings compared with their ceramics!

                  <font size="-1"> - in the mid-5th century BC.</font></h3>
                <p align="left">From a potter's point of view the story and interest 
                  in Greek pottery is now practically over. The decline began 
                  surprisingly early, well before the end of the 5th century BC. 
                  and there are probably many causes. The inherent limitations 
                  of the curving pot surface and the limited colors, meant that 
                  pottery painters could no longer compete with the rapid strides 
                  toward naturalism taken by painters of larger works such as 
                  wall paintings. The following images illustrate this decline. 
                  The most inventive artists no longer wanted to design or decorate 
                  terracotta pottery; they preferred the color and breadth of 
                  wall painting or other crafts.</p>

                  A late 5th century BC. Attic Krater: preparations for a theatrical

                  Various attempts to introduce spatial depth into their designs 
                  by the selective grouping of figures were not very successful. 
                  This 5th century attic krater shows a crowded scene; the preparations 
                  for a theatrical performance. The different levels destroy any 
                  attempt at reality. To build such scenes at different levels, 
                  you need to understand the principles of linear or geometric 
                  perspective and, as far as we can tell , the Greeks never did 
                  discover this.

                  Detail of florid style painting on a hydria made ca.410BC. </font>After 
                  430 BC pottery painting was increasingly trivialized in conception 
                  and sentimental in emotional tone. Drawing became over-refined 
                  and careless, and groups of figures were crowded together without 
                  meaning or interest. Basically this is a Red-Figure painting 
                  by the Meidias Painter. Painted in a florid stylized manner 
                  it is also embellished here and there with gold leaf. The scene 
                  is from a tale about Phaon, a grizzled old boatman, who the 
                  Gods transformed into a handsome youth irresistible to women... 
                  The painting is filled with nymphs frolicking hither and thither. 
                  The restraint of the earlier Classical part of the 5th century 
                  has gone, replaced by boisterous, sometimes wild, extravagances 
                  in taste. The coming 4th century BC will be a Greek Baroque 
                  Age.</p>

                  The ugly shape of this amphora, the fashionable, stylized manner 
                  of drawing, all illustrate the progressive decline into a manneristic 
                  style where exaggeration and distortion of the human form became

                  The restrained naturalism of the late 6th and early 5th centuries 
                  was gradually replaced by exaggerated poses, sentimental scenes 
                  and excessive ornament. Athens began the 5th century wealthy 
                  and proud; by the end of the century its power had vanished. 
                  Social unrest and wider political problems led to war between 
                  the city states. Trade and commerce became badly affected. Pottery 
                  design and decoration had blossomed into flower during the course 
                  of the early fifth century BC by the beginning of the next century 
                  it had lost much of its creativity.</p>

                  The vases characteristic of this later period are gaudier, with 
                  details added in white and sometimes in yellow-brown, gold, 
                  and blue. The subjects and treatment are often trivial and sentimental; 
                  and attempts at naturalism and depth perspective were always 
                  at odds with the pottery shapes. By the 4th century, the figured 
                  decoration of pottery had become a degenerate art, and it had 
                  died out in Athens by 320 BC.

                  Relatively few large Greek terracotta pieces like this have 
                  survived. Even today the various modeling, molding and joining 
                  of such large hollow pieces would be considerable. Further problems 
                  follow with such big pieces: drying, shrinkage and firing. It 
                  is probable that stone, particularly white marble, became the 
                  preferred alternative to terracotta, in Greece of the late 5th 
                  century onwards. Marble would certainly pose fewer problems 
                  to make and finish! In the next tutorial <a href="histx107.html" target="midright">T7</a> 
                  you can see more examples of similar life-size terracotta sculptures 
                  made, from the 6th century BC onwards, by the Etruscans in Italy.<br>

                  This is all that remains of what was almost certainly an almost 
                  life-size statue of the Goddess. It would probably have been 
                  richly painted and placed in a shrine or temple. The style of 
                  sculpture and painting at the beginning of the 5th century BC. 
                  was approaching naturalism. The techniques for representing 
                  the eyes, the mouth and the facial muscles were as yet not quite 
                  resolved. The facial expression is often called "the Archaic 
                  Smile". Ten or twenty years later the Greek artists achieved 
                  a style of &quot;ideal naturalism&quot; which has been admired 
                  down the ages.</p>

                <h3 align="left" class=first>Potters and Potteries in Ancient 
                  Greece</h3>
                <p align="left"><strong>The Smooth Shiny Finish</strong><br>
                  Classical Greek potters made the next significant advance in 
                  large scale pottery production since the invention of the wheel. 
                  They produced a wide range of purpose-made practical shapes, 
                  expertly made by throwing or molding and smoothly finished by 
                  lathe-turning to give bold, often metal-like, forms. These were 
                  then decorated with a repertoire of attractive patterns and 
                  naturalistic images. Finally they were expertly fired in carefully 
                  controlled wood-fired kilns to produce the dominant characteristic 
                  color scheme of Terracotta red and shiny black. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Mass-Production</strong><br>
                  By the beginning of the 5th century BC. pottery-making in Greece 
                  was a mass-production business with a pottery-owner employing 
                  many workmen. Usually each clay worker had a specific and limited 
                  area of work; be it digging or refining clay. For potters there 
                  were more skilled jobs concerned with throwing, molding, decorating 
                  and firing pottery. Ancient Greek pottery factories did not 
                  have coal, gas or electricity, nor the slip-casting possibilities 
                  using plaster of Paris, but I suspect they had a lot in common 
                  with much later early industrial potteries in Europe.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Later Comparisons</strong><br>
                  Potters in 5th century BC Athens or 18th century Stoke-on-Trent, 
                  England were both producing ware for large domestic and export 
                  markets. They shared many similar requirements and would have 
                  had many similar problems though over two millennia apart. Both 
                  needed to produce a range of repeatable shapes, high standards 
                  of finish and attractive, repeatable decoration. If we compare 
                  5th century BC Greek Pottery and 18th century AD Staffordshire 
                  Pottery, using these criteria, each appears to have a lot in 
                  common.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Factory Conditions</strong><br>
                  It's sad to realize that Greek potteries were probably as dirty 
                  and dangerous as the 18th century ones in England. The pottery 
                  quarter of a town was almost a ghetto for potters. The lives 
                  of the potters would have been hard in both places.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Status</strong><br>
                  In Greece many potters were almost certainly slaves. The pottery 
                  shape-designers and the painter-decoraters were treated with 
                  respect,some even achieved national fame; their working conditions 
                  and status were the highest in the industry. In Greece, some 
                  large, well finished and superbly decorated pots often had the 
                  names of both potter and decorator written on the side of the 
                  pot for all to see.</p>
