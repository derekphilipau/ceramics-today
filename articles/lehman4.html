              <b>A Trip to Okayama<br>
              Visiting Matsukawa Hiromi and Kakurezaki Ryuichi </b>
 <p align="center"> <br>

              <i>Piece by Matsukawa Hiromi</i> </p>
            <p>The Shinkansen pulled into Okayama station at dusk. As I descended 
              the platform, headed down the stairs and was scanning the far reaches 
              of the train station for my friends Chiaki and Hiromi Matsukawa, 
              I practically &quot;ran them over&quot; at the bottom of the stairs 
              as I was looking above the crowd in the station. We had a good laugh, 
              and headed for their car, enjoying the 30-minute drive to their 
              home in Oodoi, outside Okayama. Although the Matsukawa's home is 
              in the middle of &quot;Bizen Country,&quot; Hiromi continues to 
              work in the Shigaraki tradition, for he completed his apprenticeship 
              in Shigaraki with Kanzaki Shiho. </p>

              <i>Matsukawa Chiaki and Hiromi, with Matsuura Minoru, outside Hiromi's

            <p>My intention in visiting Matsukawa Hiromi was to complete the &quot;third 
              leg&quot; of a series of interviews that I had been conducting for 
              an article entitled &quot;Three Generations of Contemporary Japanese 
              Master/Apprentice Relationships.&quot; I'd already spoken with Matsuyama 
              Suketoshi, who is in his late 80s, and to his independent apprentice 
              Kanzaki Shiho, who just turned 60. It was now turn for 42-year-old 
              Hiromi-san, an independent apprentice to Master Kanzaki.<br>
              <br>
              <br>

              While I stayed near the Oodoi-gama with Hiromi and Chiaki, I was 
              treated to four days of the most generous hospitality. They invited 
              me to share in the meaningful content of their lives -- cooking, 
              eating with friends, visiting with neighbors, celebrating a wedding 
              anniversary, sharing the first eggplant of the season, making an 
              anniversary-prompted visit to the cemetery, visiting the Oodoi-gama 
              kiln site, and observing Matsukawa-san make some chawan. My stay 
              included a day of traveling to some of the Bizen highlights in the 
              area. We visited some galleries and I got a nice overview of the 
              contemporary work being produced and sold in the Bizen area.</p>
            <p>For me, a highlight of that day of travel was a warm and gracious 
              meeting with Kakurezaki Ryuichi, a remarkable contemporary potter 
              working within -- and extending -- the Bizen tradition. We'd met 
              before, during the 1999 International Wood-fire Conference in Iowa 
              City, USA. But this was my first visit to his home and studio. </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p><br>
              The hospitality was wonderful. Tea and sweets and relaxed conversation. 
              Among other things, Kakurezaki spoke of the progression in his thinking 
              during the past years. He spoke of a time when he was 35 years old. 
              It suddenly dawned upon him, he said, that his life was likely half 
              over -- that there was only &quot;half a life left to work.&quot; 
              From that point on, and for many years &quot;I worked hard and kept 
              on running,&quot; Kakurezaki said. Although now at post-50, he admits 
              that some of that compulsion has changed. But what hasn't changed, 
              he said, is his sense about what is the most important thing to 
              do. &quot;If you make the pots that you really want to make, those 
              pieces at the very center of your interest, those pieces which are 
              for you a passion -- this is the most important thing! It is fine 
              if these works are accepted by others, but if they are not, it is 
              still important to make them. After all, if making lots of money 
              is the most important thing to you, then you should probably do 
              something other than work with clay. But for me, I live for this 
              work, it is so exciting and so moving each time I open the kiln. 
              I live for this moment, to feel this emotion! I want to continue 
              to make these 'works-of-my-passion' for as long as I can. It is 
              right to do your passion while you can!&quot; </p>

            <p>I also enjoyed the opportunity to see Kakurezaki's studio and kilns 
              (he was beginning to fire his anagama, or single-chamber kiln, on 
              that day), and view some of his finished works. I will especially 
              treasure the little ochoko (sake cup) that he gave to me as a gift, 
              and the tokkuri (sake bottle) that I purchased. And I will always 
              remember his important words, and his encouragement to always follow 
              one's passion.<br>
