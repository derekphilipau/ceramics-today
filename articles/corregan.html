              Corregan takes pleasure in distracting objects away from their original 
              function by distorting and stretching them to impossible dimensions 
              in order to magnify them and make them playful. Ceramist and sculptor, 
              her forms originate on paper. It is these drawings which will determine 
              the technique she will need to create them.
            <p> Born in 1954 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, Corregan now lives in the 
              south of France. Her time is divided between her studio and her 
              job teaching sculpture and ceramics at the Ecole d'Arts Plastiques 
              in Monaco. Corregan came to France at a young age and began her 
              studies in art at the Beaux Arts in Toulon, Marseilles, and finally 
              in Aix-en-Provence in 1977. Her first contacts with clay took place 
              during her American schooling but her initiation to raku came later 
              while studying ceramics with Jean Biagini in Aix. Jim Romberg's 
              and Paul Soldner's visits were a revelation. &quot;Jim used his 
              slips and glazes like a painter uses his paints,&quot; she recalled. 
              The different stages of firing and postfiring reduction, the coordination 
              of gestures and the complicity of the artist with fire fascinated 
              her.
            <p> Corregan prefers to use a white raku clay with a talc content 
              because of the soft yet almost metallic patinas she obtains with 
              a strong smoking after firing. She uses one glaze and one engobe, 
              each made up of gerstley borate, kaolin and silica, colored with 
              oxides or stains, following no precise formula, used as such or 
              mixed together depending on the degree of glossiness she might be 
              searching for. She spends a great deal of time painting each piece, 
              following the outlines of her drawings previously incised into the 
              clay when it is still wet. One might speak of it more as coloring 
              rather than glazing. She takes into account the fact that these 
              engravings or incisions will become a rich black after smoking the 
              work and in that way be reinforced and accentuated. &quot;What particularly 
              interests me,&quot; says Corregan, &quot;is the transformation the 
              clay surfaces and richness of tones obtained by smoking. The clay 
              takes on a grey or black color and becomes a background  for a 
              more pictorial work. Whether I decide to cover I my work with decoration, 
              or simply engrave or fill in my drawings with solid colors, or perhaps 
              superimpose brushstrokes of a different quality of glaze and color, 
              the smoking of the piece following firing tends to bind these different 
              surface treatments to the body  of the piece itself and therefore 
              may be considered more as the skin of the work rather than its clothing.&quot;
            <p> Corregan works more on the representation of the object than on 
              the object itself. She wants to demonstrate that a pot for example, 
              by removing it from its daily context may be just as important as 
              a sculpture or painting. She will flatten it, exaggerate its size 
              or even highlight only one of its details. She uses diverse materials 
              such as clay, metal, glass or bronze. She works in series and in 
              what we might classify into three families: destructured <br>
              pots; geometric volumes; and sculpture/objects, often anthropomorphic.

            <p> Daphne Corregan lives intensely. In art and day-to-day life, she 
              is impulsive. She enjoys the art of everyday life, and its objects. 
              She is willingly influenced by clay architecture, seen during her 
              trips to the southwest of America and to Africa, by Italian and 
              Egyptian frescoes, by Etruscan tombs, street graffiti, contemporary 
              dance, and by artists she admires, such as Picasso, Miro, Matisse, 
              Tapies, Dejonghe, Penicaud, Twombly, Viallat and many others. The 
              freedom and whimsy of Picasso's ceramics have always attracted and 
              <br>
              amused her. For the decoration of some of her pitchers, the idea 
              of <br>
              collage or pattern painting may be used but she wants the decoration 
              to become a part of the piece and not too strong as to distract 
              the eye. Their forms are relatively simple. Incisions, sorts of 
              scarifications delimit the zones where the clay will be left alone 
              or covered with glaze or slips; other pieces will be simply smoked, 
              and here, the miracle always renewed by flame will, on Corregan's 
              pitchers, bring to our imagination evocations of birds or animals. 
              Their decoration is two-sided; they often are composed of two slabs 
              joined together at the sides and some almost take on an air of a 
              penguin or a striped rabbit, while others have strange beaks and 
              ears. Is this a distant memory of Kachina dolls or Oceanic sculptures?
            <p> Affected by the atrocities that have occurred in the past few 
              years, in particular in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, Corregan 
              felt the need to create figurative sculptures. Her first figures 
              had arms that actually were arms, then they became victims, marked 
              by scars, but always remained standing. Her wheeled chariots might 
              symbolize humanity forced to exodus, and the 'limbs' as if set in 
              a gangue, a little like those of Giacometti, are a way, for Corregan, 
              of reacting to land mines. For her recent vases, measuring up to 
              110 cm tall, Corregan had the idea of making them with bases. These 
              bases may take the shape of a shelf-forming body with the vase or 
              pitcher itself <br>
              and hung on a wall, or a pedestal from where the vase will emerge.
            <p><a href="images/corregan/corregan5.jpg"><img src="images/corregan/corregan5_sm.jpg" width="103" height="125" hspace="2" border="0" align="left"></a>Some 
              of these vases were designed to carry flowers, the flowers acting 
              as a prolongation of the vase itself and thus completing its form. 
              This series is the continuation of her work on the mold and imprint 
              but is also reminiscent of an earlier series on the mortar and pestle 
              begun in 1994-96 after her first trip to Burkina Faso. Corregan 
              is constantly leading us to new directions. This time, she is working 
              on dresses, full-length strapped dresses, some with apertures, another 
              with a smocked waist. They stand alone. The heavily-smoked clay 
              gives them sumptuous hues of blacks and grays: &quot;There is such 
              an enormous variety of blacks... matt blacks, silent, that absorb 
              light... more metallic ones, full of reflections and nocturnal connotations, 
              slightly sophisticated and mischievous.&quot; Here and there some 
              inlaid porcelain or a touch of glaze accentuates the richness of 
              hues. With these dresses (145 cm/high) she excels in what is her 
              approach: the desire to see her clay become alive, to become just 
              as vibrant as when it was still full of water, and to catch the 
              light in the same manner as when she modeled her pieces. In order 
              to achieve this she will not cover the clay with a layer of glaze 
              nor disrupt it with a strong texture: &quot;I can't imagine covering 
              this work with another skin other than the clay itself or in any 
              case with only a little. And I believe that it is precisely this 
              'little' that attracted me to raku.&quot;
            <p> <a href="images/corregan/corregan3.jpg"><img src="images/corregan/corregan3_sm.jpg" width="134" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>Parallel 
              to these dresses she is also working on enormous cylinders, a continuation 
              of her research on inside/outside also illustrated by her heads. 
              She plans on decorating the 'inside' with a repetitive design and 
              those subtle matt glazes of hers, leaving the outside to be only 
              blackened by smoke. Daphne Corregan starts with objects from everyday 
              life whose beauty comes from the forms dictated by the needs of 
              the human body and not by an intellectual research, preconceived. 
              Corregan's originality is to penetrate into the interior of the 
              given object in order to move around it, creating a new dynamic, 
              and to transform it through drawing into something more playful. 
              One is struck by her great freedom in the way of expressing forms. 
              It radiates energy, pleasure and humor. What tends to unify this 
              work is without a doubt the warm and sensual way she has of drawing 
              and painting. Miro said that &quot;a work should fertilize the imagination&quot;. 
              It is this spirit that Corregan's open forms call out to us.
            <p>Daphne's work can be seen at the Galerie Marianne Brand in Carouge, 
              Switzerland, until 18 June 2004. On the 13 June, Daphne and her 
              husband Gilles Suffren will host an 'artists dialogue' at the ceramics 
              studios of Carouge/Fondation Bruckner.
