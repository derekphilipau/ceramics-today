                    classical porcelain is unlike any other clay. Westerners have 
                    described its properties as like throwing cottage cheese. 
                    The first porcelain of late 10th century Song Dynasty consisted 
                    of one ingredient, chinastone felspar, petunze in the local 
                    dialect. The rock was ground into a paste by water-powered 
                    hammer mills, a practice still in use today. The restrictions 
                    of throwing wet powdered stone resulted in the intimate wares 
                    of Song and Yuan dynasties. Kaolin clay, gaolin, was discovered 
                    around 500 years ago during the Ming Dynasty in the mountain 
                    village of Gaolin. This addition of white gaolin clay to the 
                    petunze gave a structure to the porcelain and made possible 
                    the throwing of large forms, both as complete pieces and in 
                    the sectional cylinders of the body-height vases.</p>
                  <p align="left"> <img src="images/jingdezhen2b.jpg" alt="Throwing Classical Porcelain in Jingdezhen" width="242" height="182" hspace="2" align="left">Since 
                    the Ming period, the composition of the porcelain body has 
                    remained 60 per cent chinastone and 40 per cent kaolin. Both 
                    materials were traditionally made into brick shapes and mixed 
                    together. Before the invention of the pugmill, craftsmen would 
                    wedge a large mass of clay with their feet into a circular 
                    mound. Now it is pugged and then lightly rolled towards the 
                    body. Containing no ball clays and thus having little plasticity, 
                    classical Jingdezhen porcelain is an adventure to throw. The 
                    general rule is to throw thick walled pieces and, when thoroughly 
                    dry, trim both the inside and outside to desired thickness. 
                    As much as half the body will be trimmed away. The wheel is 
                    run on a large and powerful electric motor with pulleys. An 
                    old-fashioned lever that clicks into notches regulates the 
                    speed, much like the old farm tractors. Thick bats, more than 
                    one metre in diameter, are centred on the wheel head and stay 
                    in place by the sheer weight of the clay.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/jingdezhen3b.jpg" alt="Throwing Classical Porcelain in Jingdezhen" width="247" height="182" hspace="2"></p>
                  <p align="left"> The next step is to get a dozen or more of 
                    the 10 kilo porcelain balls on to the wheel. The growing mound 
                    is centred one ball at a time until a sufficient mass is attained. 
                    Initial centring requires the help of an assistant grasping 
                    the hands of the master thrower and forcing his energies through 
                    the master&#8217;s hands to centre the clay. At some studios 
                    two assistants steady the master&#8217;s hands for centring 
                    and opening. The centred clay is then opened and the bottom 
                    is quickly widened to its desired measure. The walls are raised 
                    progressively and then shaped. An assistant&#8217;s hands 
                    are used in the throwing until the final shape is near. The 
                    last shaping is completed by the master alone until the form 
                    reaches 1.5 m in diameter. The apparent simplicity and ease 
                    belie a master&#8217;s touch with a difficult material. The 
                    rim is carefully measured with a stick. Many shapes are parts 
                    of a two or three piece finished form.</p>
                  <p align="left"> Sections are assembled after the pieces have 
                    become bone dry in the sun and each section has been rough 
                    trimmed. A slurry of pancake batter consistency is made with 
                    the trimmings from the specific pieces to be joined. This 
                    is poured on to the rim of the bottom piece and the top section 
                    is lowered and centred. Within 10 seconds the trimmer begins 
                    to shave the assembled form to a final shape. The tools are 
                    kept razor sharp. It takes four men to haul away the porcelain 
                    form on a wooden platform with handles and take it out into 
                    the sun to dry. If it does not crack here it will make it 
                    through the firing. Attempting to trim Jingdezhen porcelain 
                    before it is dry is folly because the tools gouge out chunks 
                    of clay. The tools and the process must follow the nature 
                    of the material. A final soaking of the surface with a thick 
                    round brush dipped in water reveals any imperfections such 
                    air bubbles which must be removed.</p>

                    blue qinghua decoration is frequently brushed on to to the

                    All Jingdezhen wares are once-fired at 1300&#8211;1330&deg;C 
                    in propane gas kilns &#8211; the old coal-fired kilns are 
                    being phased out. Enamels or gold lustres can be added with 
                    an additional firing at 800&deg;C.<br>
                    Jingdezhen is the home of nine of the 26 Masters of Art and 
                    Craft of China, the highest national accolade. This title 
                    is generally reserved for the decorators. The unsung craftsmen 
                    throwers are hidden away in factories and one stumbles upon 
                    them to watch in awe at their tremendous skill and humbleness. 
                    During the events of the Jingdezhen 1000 Years Celebration 
                    of Porcelain taking place in 2004 and 2005, visitors will 
                    be rewarded by a guided tour to the factory studios to learn 
                    the secrets of classical porcelain techniques, including the 
                    virtuosity of the master throwers.</p>
