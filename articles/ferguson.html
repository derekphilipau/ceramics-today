              American Master of Anagama
            <p align="center"> <img src="../images/potw/ferguson.jpg" alt="Anagama wood fired tea bowl w/ tenmoku &amp; natural fly ash glazes" width="220" height="179" hspace="3" align="left"><b>In 
              his own words</b></p>
            <p>My work is for the eyes, hands, and the heart. I attempt to create 
              pottery with the same dynamic energy as my teachers and the Shigaraki 
              and Bizen artists of traditions&#8217; past - yet as an American 
              who as been inspired by these fine works. I am attracted to the 
              sculptural qualities of the stoneware clay body I use - its earthiness 
              and rawness of being, its masculinity and brutality-it is all there 
              for you to see - it is a heavily grogged, iron-laden stoneware body 
              that is raw or &#8220;single fired,&#8221; no bisque. I also use 
              its polar opposite, porcelain, with its silky smooth, feminine character, 
              its whiteness and purity, it softness and kindness to my hands. 
              The works are glazed with shino because of its atmospheric interaction, 
              earthiness as well as ash and salt glazes. I enjoy the green gems 
              of pooled ash and the depth of the clay/glaze relationship that 
              single firing allows. I use a gas kiln or my Anagama to fire my 
              work. With its torn and rough surfaces on the outside, its smooth 
              and gentle surfaces on the inside, my work is about struggle and 
              development, searching and finding as one progresses up their own 
              path.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/potw/ferguson2.jpg" alt="Anagama wood fired vessel w/ oribe &amp; natural fly ash glazes" width="136" height="139" align="left">Working 
              with clay has been a struggle for me because the clay reflects every 
              action, thought and lack of attention. It is the looking glass of 
              dirt. There is no &#8220;cheating&#8221; the clay, for everything 
              you do is there to see&#8212;your mediocrity, your laziness, your 
              expertise, your creative intelligence. When you are honest with 
              yourself, it has the opportunity to teach you about many things 
              about yourself and the purpose of your existence. Any true, creative 
              process will bring this about.</p>
            <p>I have spent a great deal of my time developing and experimenting 
              with the most traditional form of glazing and firing, &#8220;raw 
              firing&#8221; where very few contemporary clay artists work in this 
              process because of its unreliability and high percentage of loss. 
              I see the potential for loss as the potential to create something 
              extraordinary.</p>
            <p>We live in a world that says we can control our environment, that 
              we can create security by surrounding ourselves with material things, 
              insurance, money, a bigger better safer car or truck. This notion 
              of security I believe is an illusion. If something is going to happen&#8230;.it 
              will happen - it is rather how we deal with the situation and move 
              on that defines us. </p>
            <p><img src="../images/potw/ferguson3.jpg" alt="Anagama wood fired vessel w/ copper &amp; natural fly ash glazes" width="142" height="205" align="left">I 
              have learned that you are not the clothes you wear...the car you 
              drive...you are not your bank account, your net worth, your beautiful 
              body - you are something much more than you know yourself to be...therein 
              the creative process is your true self discovery.</p>
            <p>Destination, as our scientists are now discovering in our DNA, 
              I believe, is a complex montage of multiple lives, multiple actions 
              and reactions, causes and effects - and our living is a playing out 
              of these causes and effects - discovering our true selves and relationship 
              to what is true. What we can do at best is try to flow with elements 
              in our environment. Trying to exercise control over that which we 
              have no control over will only lead to unhappiness. </p>
            <p>I attempt to create forms that will have a relationship to the 
              conditions of fire and flame, ash and cooling that will take place 
              during the firing. I enjoy the risk taking&#8212;because of what 
              may be, because of what might happen beyond the confines of a totally 
              controlled environment, because of what unique gem may ensue. My 
              work, in its simple utilitarian and sculptural forms, attempts to 
              speak to the divine in us, to draw your attention in and consider 
              the infinite and creation. </p>
            <p><img src="images/tonyfergusonwaddingpot.jpg" alt="Wadding a pot" width="165" height="221" align="left">Like 
              the Abstract Expressionist movement, I try to coordinate the elements 
              for the &#8220;Happy Accidents&#8221; to take place. It is a relationship 
              between myself, the clay, glaze and firing process and something 
              more&#8212;that is what has drawn me to clay and the wood firing 
              process, for the wood firing process embodies all the five elements&#8212;earth, 
              air, fire, water, ether, and their enveloping relationships of fusion 
              and timelessness. Under the starry night, this exciting and unbelievably 
              labor intensive process brings me closer to the act of creation&#8212;a 
              soul expressing itself on the curtails of the creator, a child imitating 
              its father, a soul making its way in this creation, creating, developing, 
              becoming.</p>
