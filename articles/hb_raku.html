              <i>One of the most popular activities for ceramists of all levels 
              is raku firing. This ancient Japanese technique has been adapted 
              to uses quite different from its original purpose as a quick method 
              for firing disposable tea bowls for use during the Japanese tea 
              ceremony. There are plenty of sites on the 'Net that have wonderful 
              raku pieces, but for now, we'll just point out the sites with kiln 
              plans or kiln firings. </i></p>

                    Ken Turner built these fiber raku kilns based on the original 
                    clamshell design by John Harris and Mike Blackwell. His photos 
                    show how the upper parts of the kilns fold down on either 
                    side to aid in loading and unloading, then fold together vertically 
                    for firing. The kilns are also on large casters for ease of 
                    transport. To enter the site, click on the pot with the gold 
                    lid, then scroll down the left-hand menu for the link to "Raku 
                    firing." From there, click on the small photo at the top of

              explanatory text, shows pieces fired to cone 9 in about 3-1/2 hours 
              and salted for about 40 minutes then cooled for about 6-8 hours 
              before "downstacking" the kiln. From the home page click "Raku,"

              Ms. Goebels makes large raku spheres that she removes by hand from 
              her kiln, wearing protective gear. The page has several good photos 
              show Ursula in her heat-resistant outfit removing a piece from the 
              kiln. She uses a combination fire brick and fiber kiln.<br>

              "Pottery Tech" is an online publication intended to inform readers 
              about contemporary and historical pottery of Japan. The original 
              'fujisan' made by Hon-ami Koetsu is categorized as a 'Shiro Raku', 
              or white raku tea bowl. Japanese potter Genya Sonobe gives instructions 
              for his interpretation of Koetsu's bowl, with a description and 
              images of glazing and firing the bowl, including when to remove 
              it from the kiln. There is also a link to an image of the original 
              "White Raku" tea bowl. From the English home page, click the highlighted

              online magazine "Imagine Céramique" by Blandine and Marc-Antoine 
              Mouilleron, describing a raku firing workshop. All participants 
              are wearing protective cartridge-type masks. The kiln is a very 
              interesting square metal and fiber structure with a removable body 
              and a lid that can be hinged up, and includes a sizeable chimney.

              A car kiln firing is used for raku in this ceramics facility. The 
              bottom rolls out so pieces can be removed easily while they are 
              hot. From the home page click on "Art," "Enter Art Department." 
              When loaded, click "Concentrations," "Ceramics," and from the "Ceramics" 
              "drop-down" menu click "Raku." By the way, you need an up-to-date

              Photos and text of the basic raku process using an old electric 
              kiln converted to gas. The temperature reached is approximately 
              1600°F. The Youngs quench their pots in a pail of water after smoking 
              them in a covered metal barrel full of combustible materials like 
              newspaper or sawdust. There are good shots of the cherry red glow 
              that indicates that the kiln is getting close to the proper temperature 
              for glaze maturity in a typical raku firing. <br>
