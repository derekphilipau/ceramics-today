        he uses for making tools and throwing porcelain</font></b> 
      <p> <img src="../images/whyte2.jpg" height=175 width=246 align=RIGHT hspace=3>With 
        the making of porcelain in an Oriental way, pieces are designed and made 
        in relation to the inside shape of the ware. The first part in the design 
        process is to determine the desired shape and size of the finished article. 
        This is usually drawn to scale. But because of the high shrinkage involved 
        with porcelain, it is necessary to expand this drawing by 17 percent to 
        have the accurate measurements in which to design your tools. In the design 
        process it is also important to consider the practicality of the shape 
        being made and that there is often some slumping of the shape in the glaze 
        firing which for example, leaves a teapot a little less round than it 
        was initially. 
      <p>Usually, the first tool made is the tonbo (dragonfly) measure. This is 
        the bamboo tool that measures the depth and width of the item being made. 
        The reason for making the tonbo measure first is that the other tools 
        are then made to this measure. Along with the tonbo goes the bamboo knife 
        which attaches to the top of the tombo and is used to trim and clean the 
        rim of pieces as well as for cutting the item from the wheel head in some 
        instances. A bamboo knife can be sharp, so treat it with respect. There 
        are usually two types of throwing rib used: the hera and the kote. The 
        kote is the initial throwing rib and is usually made from a fine grained 
        softwood (such as huon pine or celery top pine) and about the thickness 
        of one's finger. This throwing rib is slightly smaller than the hera which 
        is the final shaping tool and is made from hard fine timber such as pear 
        or cherry wood, cut as a thin plank and tapered to a fine edge which is 
        polished to impart the finish to the inside surface of what you are making. 
        Another tool that has multiple uses is the dango. This is made from similar 
        wood to the kote but is usually much thicker and is used to beat the inside 
        base of large pots to tighten the clay and help prevent cracking of the 
        base. It is also used instead of the hand inside to help throw large pots. 
        It gives a smooth surface to the inside of a vessel rather than leaving 
        the marks of the fingers. It is not easy to describe the shapes and the 
        difficulties of making such tools; it is an art best learnt under the 
        watchful eyes of a master or in a workshop situation. Nevertheless, much 
        can be discovered through trial, error and correction, once the basic 
        principles are understood.
