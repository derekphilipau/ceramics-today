                  Ceramics Festival in Aberystwyth</b></a> (Wales, UK) celebrated 
                  its tenth anniversary in 2005, the biennial nature of the event 
                  meaning that it has been in existence for over 18 years. The 
                  festival is a joint initiative between Aberystwyth Arts Centre 
                  (where it takes place) and North and South Wales Potters, and 
                  each festival welcomes over 1000 ceramicists and potters from 
                  all over the world to partake in a heady mix of demonstrations, 
                  talks, lectures, spectacular firings given by renowned and influential 
                  potters and ceramicists from all over the world.

                <p>The festival instigated a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999 
                  as a means of recognising ceramic artists or potters who have 
                  made a major contribution to the world of ceramics. Past winners 
                  to date are Ray Finch (1999), Mick Casson (2001) Janet Mansfield 
                  and Warren McKenzie (2003) and David Leach and Janet &amp; Frank 
                  Hamer (2005).</p>
                <p>The first winner of the award was Ray Finch in <a href="http://www.internationalceramicsfestival.org/pastevents/1999.html"><b>1999</b></a>.
                  Ray Finch attended the Central School of Art, London, under 
                  the instruction of Dora Billington in the mid 1930s and in 1936 
                  was offered a position at Winchcombe Pottery. In 1939 he was 
                  left in charge, whilst Michael Cardew set up a new pottery at 
                  Wenford Bridge, Cornwall. During The Second World War Finch 
                  served in the National Fire Service. After the war in 1946 he 
                  resumed his post at Winchcombe and eventually purchased the 
                  business from Michael Cardew who had moved to Africa. During 
                  the 1950s Finch diverted the pottery production at Winchcombe 
                  away from slip decorated earthenware to stoneware. In 1979 he 
                  handed over the management of Winchcombe to his son Michael.</p>
                <p>Ray was presented with his award at the 1999 festival by fellow 
                  potter Mick Casson &#8211; who coincidentally was the second 
                  recipient of the award in <a href="http://www.internationalceramicsfestival.org/pastevents/2001.html"><b>2001</b></a>.
                  Mick Casson, who sadly died in December 2003, was the first 
                  to be honored with an OBE for &quot;Services to his Craft&quot;. 
                  He made his first pots in 1945 and set up his first workshop 
                  in Russell Square in 1952 making tin glazed figures and pots. 
                  His first solo exhibition was held at Heals in London in 1959 
                  and the same year he moved his workshop to Prestwood in Buckinghamshire. 
                  Disaster struck in 1963 when the pottery was destroyed by fire 
                  but together he and his wife Sheila built a gas kiln and re-established 
                  their pottery making stoneware and porcelain production ware. 
                  The same year he founded the studio pottery course at Harrow 
                  School of Art with Victor Magrie - the first vocational course 
                  of its kind. From 1971-73 he was Head of the Ceramics Department 
                  at Harrow School of Art. From 1975 until the mid 1980s he was 
                  a member of the first board of Dartington Training workshops. 
                  He also traveled regularly to the United States to teach, lecture 
                  and exhibit his work. Many will remember Mick for his film &quot;Michael 
                  Casson Studio Potter&quot; which won the Cirus Films Gold Medal 
                  in 1967, his book &quot;Pottery in Britain Today&quot; 1967, 
                  and the BBC TV series &quot;The Craft of the Potter&quot; which 
                  was followed by a book of the same name in 1975. In memory of 
                  his contribution to the world of ceramics, the Ceramics Festival 
                  instigated a special Mick Casson Memorial Lecture to take place 
                  at each festival. The inaugural lecture was given by Mick&#8217;s 
                  daughter, Lucy Casson at the 2005 festival.</p>
                <p> The <a href="http://www.internationalceramicsfestival.org/pastevents/2003.html"><b>2003
                  Festival</b></a> saw two winners of the Lifetime Achievement 
                  Award &#8211; Janet Mansfield from Australia, and Warren Mckenzie 
                  from the USA. Janet is a World recognised expert on salt-glaze 
                  ceramics and is editor of the influential Australian publication 
                  '<a href="http://www.ceramicart.com.au"><b>Ceramics Art and 
                  Perception</b></a>'. Warren McKenzie and his wife Alix spent 
                  two years at the potter's cottage with Bernard Leach where he 
                  learned much of value from conversations with him. Although 
                  he and his wife had studied at an American art school they had 
                  found the training in ceramics inadequate and came to the UK 
                  to develop their competence in throwing and producing standard 
                  ware, and to experiment with techniques and ideas. Returning 
                  to America in the early 1950s Warren was appointed lecturer 
                  at the University of Minnesota but also continued with his own 
                  pottery and still to this day uses an adaptation of the wheel 
                  originally built for the St. Ives pottery. He is one of the 
                  foremost potters working within the Anglo Oriental tradition.<br>
                  . <br>
                  The winners of the <b><a href="http://www.internationalceramicsfestival.org/2005/awards.html">2005
                  Lifetime Achievement Award</a></b> were renowned potter David 
                  Leach (who sadly died earlier in the year and so was awarded 
                  the honor posthumously), and Janet and Frank Hamer, co-authors 
                  of <i>The Potter&#8217;s Dictionary of Materials and Techniques</i>. 
                  David Leach, the eldest son of the great potter Bernard Leach, 
                  was a potter of international reputation whose work is eagerly 
                  sought by collectors all over the world. He worked with his 
                  father at the Leach Pottery in St. Ives as a student, manager 
                  and partner until the mid 1950s when he set up his own studio 
                  at Lowerdown Pottery near Bovey Tracey in Devon. Aside from 
                  his own work, David worked extensively in ceramics education 
                  and for crafts organisations and throughout his career maintained 
                  his enthusiasm for ceramics, constantly striving for technical 
                  and artistic improvement. He died in February 2005 after a long 
                  and productive life.</p>
