        The Hoffman kiln at Khorobhagarat, Sudan. Because this kiln fires heavy 
        fuel oil, the wood previously burned in the clamp kilns of this arid region 
        will be conserved. </i> 
      <p> This project proposal has been endorsed by the Khartoum office of the 
        United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and is waiting 
        approval by UNIDO headquarters in Austria. On a widespread, international 
        scale, UNIDO has been the only organization to support ceramic industrial 
        projects. However, several Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) such as 
        the German development group, GTZ, and the British based Intermediate 
        Technology Development Group (ITDG), have also been active. These groups 
        have executed several successful ceramic-related projects, primarily in 
        the production of building materials. When the BRRI's newly designed vertical 
        tunnel brick kiln begins functioning, it may well be the first of its 
        kind on the African continent. It may also be the first anywhere to fire 
        carbonized agricultural waste. In Asia, these kilns fire bituminous coal 
        fines. Adapting to carbonized agri-waste offers a design that is appropriate 
        and more sustainable in Africa. 
      <p> <img align=right src="../images/safari1.jpg" width="184" height="280" hspace="8"><i>Right: 
        Sectional view of the vertical tunnel kiln.</i> 
      <p>The best I was able to do in the Sudan, besides adapting the vertical 
        tunnel kiln, was to document what ceramists there are doing and the ways 
        in which their products are essential in the everyday lives of the Sudanese. 
        Ceramic ziers (water containers) are universally used to store water. 
        Ziers are scattered around towns just like public drinking fountains, 
        so necessary in the burning, dry climate. There is a generous custom in 
        the Sudan, in which civic-minded individuals will donate and maintain 
        ziers for the community and for any passersby. Low fire ceramics range 
        from ziers to cooking pots as well as drums made by stretching animal 
        skins over a ceramic base. In the absence of other entertainment, my family 
        would often spend an evening drumming, pretending our rhythm and ceremony 
        were as sophisticated as that of the Sudanese. In another custom, Sudanese 
        drink coffee brewed in the traditional low fire gebana. The gebana resembles 
        a sphere with a small cylindrical spout pointed 45 degrees out and upward. 
        As with the zier, the gebana has a rounded bottom and is sometimes placed 
        in the sand. But it normally rests in a cloth or beaded ring, a match 
        in design to the coffee pot's incised decoration. 
      <p> For the everyday ceramics of Sudan, whole communities are typically 
        given over to production. Ziers, for example, are made in Dajo, near El 
        Obeid, by women using a red clay with an addition of millet husks and 
        mica. Often the clay is plastic, sun-parched mud, skimmed from the top 
        of dried up water holes. Products including the gebana, drums, cook pots, 
        and ziers are fired on a bonfire by the men of the community. From a scholar's 
        perspective, Sudan is of interest to both the ceramic artist and the scientist. 
        In Khartoum, the Sudan University Ceramic Department has offered a classical 
        approach to art instruction for 40 years. The graphic and three-dimensional 
        skills of the students are impressive. However, basic ceramic materials 
        are lacking; glazes are expensive and usually imported from Egypt. Individual 
        artists must have clay materials trucked in from several hours away. And 
        the public has not been adequately sensitized to the high quality of local 
        ceramic work produced, preferring instead mass produced imported ware.
