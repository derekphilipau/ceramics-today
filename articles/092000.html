              is a technique that was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, 
              before the popularization of onglazes. Slipware usually consists 
              of earthenware ceramics, on which a liquid clay (so-called '<a href="101899.html"><b>slip</b></a>')
              has been trailed on with a 'sliptrailer'. Although earthenware was 
              traditionally used, midfire clays and even stoneware clays (e.g. 
              the German <a href="http://toepferei-buergelhaus.de/"><b>Bürgel</b></a> 
              style) can also be used. The best known advocate of this style or 
              technique, was the 17th century potter from Staffordshire, England, 
              Thomas Toft. Toft's work usually consisted of a red earthenware 
              clay, onto which a lighter, cream colored clay was sliptrailed on, 
              giving the work the decorative effect. However, as can be seen in 
              the image on the right, sometimes the piece was first covered with 
              a cream engobe onto which a darker colored slip was trailed. By 
              using and combining slips of various colors it is possible to achieve 
              quite interesting decorative results. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately slipware has become somewhat rare in this day and 
              age of the decal. However, sliptrailing is not difficult to do. 
              The important thing is to match the shrinkage of the clay and slips 
              used. The easiest way is to make a slip from the same clay body 
              you intend to use. Use a light colored body, which you can color 
              with oxides or stains. Make the slip by drying out the clay and 
              re-slaking it with water. Add a little less water than a creamy 
              consistancy and a litle sodium silicate. This will decrease the 
              moisture content slightly, but retain the liquidity of the slip. 
              This will also help for a better 'fit' of slip and clay body. Your 
              slip may now be colored by adding ceramic oxides or carbonates such 
              as iron oxide, cobalt oxide, cobalt carbonate, copper oxide, copper 
              carbonate and others. Alternatively, for a larger color palette, 
              you could also add commercial stains. 
            <p>The slip is applied with a slip trailer. Commercial slip trailers 
              can be purchased at your local ceramics store, but you can substitute 
              the commercial product with a free, used empty catsup (a.k.a. ketchup, 
              tomato sauce) bottle. Cut off more or less of the tip of the trailer 
              to get the line widths you want. It's probably a good idea to have 
              a range of tips and colors in different bottles. (That's going to 
              be a lot of tomato sauce you'll have!) Once the slip decoration 
              has been applied and the work is dry, you are ready to proceed as 
              with your usual processes, i.e. bisqueing and glazing. Have fun!
