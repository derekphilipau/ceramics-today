            <p> The following information is relevant for the most common types. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>Type "R"</i><br>
              This is generally considered the better probe to use for the higher 
              stoneware temperatures. This probe uses two wires with a mixture 
              of platinum and platinum/rhodium wires that are usually very fine 
              and fragile to keep the expense down. The voltage output from type 
              "R" is very small and really only comes into its own at higher temperatures 
              above about 700° C and up to 1600° C where it can be quite accurate. 
              The correct compensating lead usually has a green outer PVC cover 
              and either white and blue or red and black colored inner cables. 
              The white and black are the plus or positive sides and the blue 
              and the red are the minus or negative cables (although the German 
              and Japanese are the opposite). <br>
              <br>
              <i>Type "K"</i><br>
              This is a much cheaper probe and uses much less expensive wire. 
              The wires are chromel and alumel, indicating the base metals, with 
              the addition of other metals to display the required output. The 
              type "K" is the workhorse probe and is used from low temperatures 
              to temperatures of around 1200° C before there can be small inaccuracies. 
              The wire can be heated to higher temperatures. The compensating 
              PVC cable outer is generally yellow but can also be red. The inner 
              cable colors are either yellow and red or brown and blue with the 
              yellow and brown the positive conductors and the red and blue the 
              negative. <i>Type "N"</i><br>
              This is a relatively new wire that was developed to fill the gap 
              between type "R" and type "K" and has proven to be an excellent 
              alternative. It was not possible to obtain controllers that were 
              suitable for type "N" until recently as type "R" would generally 
              be preferred. The compensating cable outer tends to be orange with 
              the inner colors either orange and red or orange and blue with the 
              orange always the positive (remarkable cooperation!). <br>
              <br>
              <i>Some important points to consider:</i> 
            <ul>
              <li>The junction where the compensating cable and the thermocouple 
                probe join must be kept at a temperature less than 50° C (you 
                should be able to keep your hand there for a period). If excessive 
                heat is transferred to this joint a second temperature junction 
                may be formed and large inaccuracies may result. 
              <li>The moving coil type meter must be kept level and ambient temperature 
                set. 
              <li>The length of the compensating cable must be kept to a minimum. 
              <li>Do not expect the pyrometer to indicate the actual heat work 
                that has gone into the piece. Understand the benefits and the 
                limitations. Use cones to indicate the correct temperature/work 
                rate. 
              <li>Thoroughly check the wire joints for loose terminals, oxidation, 
                excessive twists and general deterioration if you suspect a problem. 
                Ensure the correct polarity is observed. 
              <li>Keep the probe away from the flame path especially as long, 
                soft reducing flames are possible. 
              <li>Try to position the probe tip as close to the work as possible. 
                It is also usual to try to position the probe in a location that 
                will indicate a good average temperature. 
            </ul>
