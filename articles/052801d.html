            <p> <b>Safety Devices for Kilns</b>
            <div align="left"></div>
            <p> There are a range of safety devices available that will help alleviate 
              some of the concerns with gas firing: 
            <p> <i>1. High temperature cut-out</i><br>
              This device can be fitted to either gas or electric kilns and will 
              ensure the kiln will shut down at a preset maximum temperature in 
              case the operator is not in attendance. It consists of a temperature 
              controller, probe and a connection to a gas solenoid on a gas kiln 
              or a wiring bridge to the contactor an electric kiln. The temperature 
              controller can be either a cheaper "blind" model that does not indicate 
              temperature or the indicating type. Accurate digital units can be 
              quite inexpensive and will provide all the advantages of digital 
              temperature indication. 
            <p> Cones and a special device called a "kiln sitter" can also be 
              employed. The kiln sitter monitors the temperature and is activated 
              when the desired cone bends, operating a switch. 
            <p> <i>2. Flame Safety</i><br>
              Thermoelectric Safety Devices<br>
              The most common approved device is the thermoelectric type. This 
              incorporates a push button unit and the copper safety probe heated 
              by the flame. These are quite reliable and simple to operate although 
              these can be disabled. As long as the probe is kept away from the 
              hot burner port and the device is sensibly maintained, a long life 
              should be expected. The main disadvantage is that the unit takes 
              approx. 10-15 seconds to close in the event of flame out. Although 
              this is quite acceptable according to the gas regulations, many 
              work places opt for the quick lockout units for increased safety 
              and ease of use. 
            <p> <b>Make sure the kiln is adequately vented prior to a restart 
              in the event of flame out. The kiln door should always be open when 
              starting gas burners.</b> 
            <p> <i>Electronic Flame Safety and Ignition</i> <br>
              The electronic safety units utilise a gas solenoid, burner electrodes 
              and a small control unit. These kits, that are required as standard 
              equipment in most schools, shut down the gas in less than 1 second. 
              They also have the added advantage of allowing the burner to be 
              lit by simply operating a start switch. A relay is closed to power 
              an ignition transformer and open the gas solenoid. The small spark 
              will ignite the burner, the safety electrode senses the flame and 
              allows the gas to safely stay on. The sensing electrical circuit 
              works on the principal of flame rectification. Briefly, these systems 
              rely on the ability of a flame to conduct a current when a potential 
              is applied across it. The flame relay detects the DC voltage that 
              is produced when the ion flow is larger in a single direction. 
            <p> These systems have several important advantages: 
            <ul>
              <li>The flame failure lockout time is less than 1 second, thereby 
                ensuring no build up of unignited gas</li>
              <li>Long life for the components as the wire used can withstand 
                very high temperatures</li>
              <li>Automatic operation ensures the burner can be started remotely, 
                by a time switch start or a temperature programmer</li>
            </ul>
            As long as certain principles are applied, such as ensuring the earthing 
            area for the current flow is four times the area of the sense rod, 
            these should provide trouble free service. There are other flame sensing 
            systems used that are generally more industrial. The most common is 
            UV (ultra violet) sensing that uses a special globe to sense the UV 
            radiation emitted from a flame. The components are more expensive 
            but are preferred for larger burner units where there may be higher 
            flame temperatures. Many kilns have door switches fitted and electric 
            kilns can have devices that can restrict the power in unsafe situations.
