            <p> <img src="images/serbian/citakovic.jpg" width="211" height="180" align="left">The 
              contemporary ceramic scene in Serbia at the beginning of the 21st 
              century is distinguished by structured phenomena and specific artistic 
              individualities. The artistic climate in Belgrade and Novi Sad reflects 
              authentic international happenings: new artistic ideas, analytical 
              works, installations, multidisciplinary researches and experiments. 
              In his text &#8216;The Contemporary Artistic Scene in Serbia within 
              the International Context&#8217;<sup>2</sup> J. Denegri, art historian and 
              art critic, states: &#8220;From the rift with social realism in 
              the early 1950s to the domination of &#8216;socialist modernism&#8217; 
              active between 1950 and 1990, when the state of Yugoslavia was dissolved, 
              Serbian art, visual and applied, was part of West European art, 
              while ceramic art was part of the global artistic scene. This was 
              presented in numerous exhibitions. Throughout the major part of 
              the 1990s Serbian art was &#8220;forced backwards to the state of 
              art produced in the conditions of a closed society. After the sanctions 
              had been lifted and the political changes had taken place in 2000, 
              the relationship between local and international art gradually became 
              normal.&#8221; 
            <p>In the mid-1990s a generation of talented ceramic artists matured; 
              notwithstanding unfavourable political conditions and, without the 
              support of major state cultural institutions, they organised solo 
              exhibitions. A significant number of artists also took part in the 
              most important international exhibitions of artistic ceramic works.<sup>3</sup></p>
            <p> The exhibition Contemporary Serbian Ceramics at the Beginning 
              of the 21st Century is not thematically defined. The concept of 
              the show is to display the best works by artists of diverse poetic 
              expressions and interests. There are works by artists whose interests 
              are related to sculpture in ceramics, installations and multidisciplinary 
              researches or those interested in utilitarian vessel ceramics as 
              well as those for whom the pot is just the point of departure for 
              the creation of different sculptural forms. The works are executed 
              in different techniques: porcelain, stoneware, raku, terra sigillata, 
              maiolica and faience. </p>
            <p><img src="images/serbian/dordevic.jpg" width="212" height="150" align="left">The 
              exhibition comprises works by the young and youngest generations 
              of Belgrade artists of various visual, stylistic, iconographic, 
              technical and technological preferences. The aim of the exhibition 
              is to put forward those artists to whom the universal criteria of 
              contemporary art could be applied. The choice of such tendencies 
              has been determined by the existing artistic production intensified 
              in the first years of this century through the activities of ceramic 
              art colonies and numerous exhibitions. </p>
            <p>Since the political changes of October 5, 2000, international cooperation 
              has gradually been re-established and the Museum of Applied Art 
              in Belgrade has organised two shows of contemporary ceramics from 
              Japan<sup>4</sup> and Italy<sup>5</sup>. A reciprocal exhibition of contemporary Serbian 
              ceramic art has been prepared and hopefully will be implemented 
              in the near future. </p>
            <p>Although, as reported by J. Denegin, &#8220;due to a number of 
              unfavourable processes the international status of Serbian art at 
              the beginning of the 21st century appears to be unstable, almost 
              at the mercy of chance events&#8221;<sup>6</sup>. </p>
            <p>The exhibition Balkan Contemporary Ceramics, prepared by national 
              experts, was one of the events organised on the occasion of the 
              50th jubilee of the foundation of the International Academy of Ceramics 
              in Athens in 2002.<sup>7</sup> Biljana Vukotic was one of the selectors for 
              Serbia and Montenegro, and Serbian ceramic art was successfully 
              represented by the works of four young artists from Belgrade.8</p>
            <p><img src="images/serbian/ivana_batalo.jpg" width="185" height="257" align="left">The 
              most important exhibition of ceramic art in Yugoslavia and now in 
              Serbia was held in May 2003.<sup>8</sup> Janet Mansfield, ceramic 
              artist (Australia), chair of the jury of the 11th Triennial of Contemporary 
              Ceramic Art, wrote the following in the official statement of the 
              jury: &#8220;The jury, which included Sava Ristovic, art historian 
              (Belgrade) and Petar Sadi, graphic artist (Subotica) considered 
              the works in three sections and awarded the Grand Prix and three 
              specific category prizes. The members of the jury were unanimous 
              in their appraisal of the high standard all works and believe that 
              many deserved to be awarded. However, the jury selected the works, 
              which represented the most direct expressions of originality, sensitivity, 
              skilful execution and use of material and congruence with the theme 
              of the selection.</p>
            <p>&#8220;In the category &#8216;New Ideas and New Generations&#8217;, 
              curated by Olga Sram, the jury encountered works with a kinetic 
              quality, the use of mixed media and works that could be considered 
              as installations. The work Gift by Sladjana Danojevic was awarded 
              because in its concept it symbolised all of these qualities. The 
              work is convincing and original, its message is clear, the combination 
              of photography and ceramics makes an installation of plausible conceptual 
              value.</p>
            <p>&#8220;In the category &#8216;Utilitarian Ceramics&#8217; curated 
              by Gordana Biba Markovic, the jury discussed at length the relationship 
              between functional, non-functional and referential concepts with 
              regard to utilitarian objects. As the most inventive work submitted, 
              the jury awarded Cups by Dejan Stepanovic. His literal use of ceramic 
              material, his play with dramatic scale and the fact that it wittily 
              conditions the function of the object were the major elements in 
              the decision of the jury.</p>
            <p>&#8220;In the category &#8216;Ceramic Sculpture&#8217;, curated 
              by Biljana Vukotic, the jury found many exceptional sculptural works 
              dealing with the themes of nostalgia, personal history or philosophical 
              concepts, also landscape and architecture. Srdjan Vukajlivic&#8217;s 
              work Trace was selected for the award because the jury decided that 
              it reflected contemporary events and, as a work in progress, spoke 
              of destruction and rebuilding, indicating freshness and change. 
              The jury recognised in the work an idea that had evolution and continuity, 
              but also left museum custodians freedom to position it in space.</p>
            <p>&#8220;The jury awarded the Grand Prix to Jasmina Pejcic and her 
              work from 2003 for its originality and structured meaning. A glance 
              through a lens is simultaneously an interaction of the viewers with 
              the work, where they can see themselves inside a mysterious landscape 
              and be confronted with their own selves by the vision of the artist. 
              The jury believes that the 11th Triennial of Ceramic Art shows a 
              quality of works in all selections and congratulates all those who 
              have participated in the project.&#8221;<sup>9</sup> All of the awarded works 
              are now in the contemporary ceramics collection of the Museum of 
              Applied Art in Belgrade.</p>
            <p>At the 45th October Salon &#8211; Continental Breakfast &#8211; 
              Belgrade 2004,<sup>10</sup> Srdjan Vukajlivic exhibited his conceptual work 
              entitled Chance in Art. The aim of the work was the acceptance of 
              chance as an element in the process of the creation of an artwork 
              and the shaping of cultural values. The work was conceived as an 
              interaction between the author and the selector, Anda Rothenberg 
              (Poland). The concept of the work comprises two texts, by the author 
              and the selector, and an object. Chance (for example, throwing of 
              the dice) determines if the work will be exhibited. &#8220;My idea 
              is to take a continental breakfast set, break it up into small pieces, 
              then glue them together in order to make a continuous strip. The 
              object is to be displayed in the gallery together with a photograph 
              of a table laid for a continental breakfast and, of course, our 
              two texts.&#8221; </p>
            <p><img src="images/serbian/dujovic-liscevic.jpg" width="249" height="308" align="left">Vukajlivic&#8217;s 
              work Form, glued porcelain, was executed in the same technique, 
              deconstruction. The factor of serendipity in the execution of an 
              artwork and the deconstruction of an object are the essential features 
              of his expression. Installation Form I, 2003, was also made in the 
              previously described method. The departure point is a porcelain 
              plate with a gold line border as the only element of decoration. 
              When the plate is broken into smaller pieces the artist created 
              an abstract composition focusing on the movement of the golden line, 
              which turns into an infinite line without a beginning or an end.</p>
            <p>The structured composition Form, 2004 by Biljana Milenovic-Stojanovic 
              can be classified as a pot-like installation. The composition comprises 
              juxtaposed round and cylindrical elements, flat and rounded surfaces, 
              black and white. The artist achieves the dynamics of the composition 
              by emphasising the relationship between the static part and the 
              upper surface decorated with different porcelain sticks. </p>
            <p>The installation by Marija Milin has changeable dimensions; the 
              elements were thrown by hand, made in the technique of faience in 
              white and coloured clay and glazed on the inside. She was gradually 
              developing a concept of different apertures in her work as well 
              as contrasts between the flat upper surfaces and rounded forms. 
              The composition permits different combinations of spatial installation 
              owing to the diagonally cut upper surface that produce a shifted 
              base, the centre of the pot. During the forming, the white and coloured 
              masses make up a spiral decoration which is repeated in different 
              variations in all parts of the composition. </p>
            <p>Aleksandar Vac&#8217;s Abstract Panel, 2004, derives its form from 
              the rhythm produced by glazed and unglazed tiles. They could be 
              observed either individually or as being structured into a whole 
              and dominated by the contrast of metallic and unglazed surfaces.<sup>11</sup> 
            </p>
            <p>Vojislava Citakovic frequently makes narrative compositions easily 
              understood by the beholder who can &#8220;...accept or reject, laugh 
              or be revolted...&#8221; She transposes events and information from 
              an everyday environment into clay; combines the symbols of pop-culture 
              and the contemporary consumer society with her own creations and 
              imagination. Her composition Virtual Lover speaks of a new way of 
              expressing emotions: &#8220;Is it possible to show emotion on a 
              desktop and then in the heart? How many kilobytes has your love? 
              Do you have enough RAM memory for that?&#8221; Vojislava Citakovic 
              underlines the dependence of man on machines, sometimes even more 
              then on another human being. In her sculpture Mars and Venus, 2003, 
              she &#8220;converts different popular motifs into ceramics, thereby 
              expanding the borders of the medium. By the application of attractive, 
              recognisable quotations from contemporary pop culture, the artist 
              plays with traditional sculptural forms, the bust in this case&#8221;.<sup>12</sup> 
              The compositions of Citakovic are large, decorated with strong pigments 
              and porcelain slip.</p>
            <p> In her Movimento, 2003, Tijana Dujovic-Liscevic extends the previously 
              begun static-dynamic interplay of terracotta and wire shaped in 
              the form of bicycle wheels that emerge from the basic ceramic matter, 
              desiring to represent an essential vision of movement. Nemanja Nikolic, 
              Ana Sijacic and Lucija Adamovic belong to the youngest generation 
              of ceramists. They are inspired by street graffiti (Sijacic&#8217;s 
              maiolica) or represent structured narrative, symbolic compositions 
              (Three Additional Figures, Nikolic&#8217;s maiolica and Leaving 
              Adamovic&#8217;s stoneware). All these works were made in 2004. 
            </p>
            <p>In the other group are artists who take the form of pot as a basic 
              inspiration in creating their ceramic sculptures. The works exhibited 
              at the 11th Triennial introduce the pot as theme and inspiration: 
              for example Lana Tikvesa&#8217;s Magician, handmade stoneware from 
              2004. The artist explains: &#8220;Formally, these are still teapots, 
              but they closely approach abstract sculptural forms inspired by 
              the organic world, sea fauna, birds, human heart.&#8221; She arrives 
              at the form through structures of large pieces of grogged clay left 
              after tearing or ripping, still bearing the traces of the work process, 
              fractures and cracks between the fractures, with or without the 
              help of a tool. </p>
            <p><img src="images/serbian/ivana_rackov.jpg" width="253" height="173" align="left">In 
              the pair of sculptures Static Movement, stoneware, 2004, Ivana Rackov 
              starts from the traditional form of pot which she transforms into 
              floral and animal shapes taken from nature. In the cycle Source, 
              stoneware, 2004, Ivana Batalo continues the development of forms 
              begun in her characteristic way of thematic and technical treatment 
              of pot.<sup>13</sup> Although the artistic code of Larisa Ackov, Ljubica Jocic, 
              Jasmina Pejcic, Tijana Dordevic and Velimir Vukicevic is primarily 
              linked to installations and ceramic sculptures, this time they are 
              represented with works in the field of pottery. In the pots entitled 
              The Light of the Encounter and Embrace, 2003, glazed stoneware, 
              Ackov decorates the outer surfaces with her characteristic and recognisable 
              symbols of human figures and natural phenomena. The pot from the 
              cycle Searching for Beauty, 2002, by Jocic is made in stoneware 
              combined with hand-shaped clay tablets and parts made by pressing 
              the clay into the mould. The artist strives to achieve a balance 
              of a small base and ornate upper part of the pot through combinations 
              of pure form and dark unglazed facture.<sup>14</sup> In the work Triad, terra 
              sigillata, 2002, Jasmina Pejcic uses minimal means in order to extract 
              the maximum from the material and to apply to the pot the technique 
              ordinarily used in the making of ceramic sculptures. The work was 
              first fired in the electric kiln and then exposed to the process 
              of reduction. By using the simple technique of firing &#8211; a 
              hole in the ground &#8211; the work is pit-fired. &#8220;It is a 
              process where nothing depends on me any longer... that kind of unpredictability 
              attracts me, fascinates me.&#8221; </p>
            <p>Pejcic chose simple forms for her Triad since the trace of fire 
              is best presented on simple and condensed forms. The starting idea 
              of Dordevic&#8217;s Couple, 2004, is the diversity of butterfly 
              wings, their texture, patterns, colours, forms. The form of the 
              pot reminds us of a butterfly with half-closed wings. The technique 
              of paper-porcelain is conditioned by the texture of the wings made 
              from minute tiles. The objects are structured like mosaics, by arranging 
              small areas in paper-porcelain in the mould. The artist says: &#8220;Since 
              I used a coloured mass, the pattern can be seen both from the outside 
              and the inside... owing to paper porcelain these pots seem lighter 
              and thinner.&#8221; A Fine Pair of Jugs by Velimir Vukicevic, porcelain, 
              slip, glaze, 2002, is made by hand and composed of tablets that 
              have been fired several times. The geometric decoration is on the 
              upper surface, close to the opening of the jug, executed by hand 
              in lines of different width and colour. The white surface of the 
              body of the jug is made by the latex protective layer.<sup>15</sup> The pots 
              by Igor Sabadoc, from 2004, are made in turned porcelain, glazed 
              on both sides. Although unique, they are made in the minimalist 
              manner of contemporary design.</p>
            <p>We hope that the choice of artists, their works and the concept 
              of the exhibition follow the idea of Professor Ivan Tabakovi: &#8220;Artists 
              and poets have been frequently the avant-garde of discoveries. They 
              should know and observe the worlds revealed to them by scientific 
              development &#8211; the trajectory of the ball, the play of sea 
              waves, the beauty of structures, the myriad of forms, the movement 
              of shadow and light provide infinite possibilities for research. 
              One should search &#8211; search open new roads for creative forces.&#8221;<sup>16</sup></p>
