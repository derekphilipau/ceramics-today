It is a Biannual National Ceramic Invitational  hosted by The Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, Nebraska. This event is curated by Jake Jacobson, Associate Professor of Art at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. An online version of the show gives quite a good representation of the event.
<P>
A novel idea with this exhibition is that each invited artis was allowed to invite another 'guest' artist of their own, who is also represented with a work in the show. This is quite an interesting way to explore new and interesting talent, with the artists becoming quasi curators of their own.
