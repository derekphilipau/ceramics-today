              Article by Max Campbell and Chris Keane
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
              We will be introducing you to a new range of glaze colorants that 
              offer exciting new possibilities. They offer lemonade pinks, purple 
              blues and acid greens. The colorants are based on oxides of the 
              rare earth metals, neodymium, praseodymium and erbium. As the oxides 
              are soluble in the glaze we can achieve transparent colored glazes. 
              Our preliminary testing suggests that the colors can be fired at 
              earthenware, mid-fire or stoneware temperatures, as well as in oxidation 
              and reduction without significantly affecting the color achieved.</p>
            <p>The use of rare earth colorants in ceramics is a recent development 
              as the materials are only now available at reasonable prices.</p>
            <p>Investigation of the colorants is only at the starting point and 
              our work is only a preliminary look.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/lanthanides/Neodymium_Oxide_reduction.jpg" alt="Neodymium Oxide I" width="100" height="100" hspace="3"><img src="images/lanthanides/Neodymium_Oxide_reduction2.jpg" alt="Neodymium Oxide II" width="100" height="100" hspace="3"><img src="images/lanthanides/Praseodymium_Oxide_reduction.jpg" alt="Praseodymium Oxide" width="100" height="100" hspace="3"></p>
            <p><strong>What are the Rare Earths?</strong><br>
              The periodic table is the way scientists set out the elements, grouping 
              them in columns of materials having similar nature, i.e. Li, Na, 
              P etc are all metals having a single electron in the outer shell. 
              When the table was established there was a group of elements that 
              did not really fit, so rather than changing the model they were 
              separated off. At the time they were considered rare, hence the 
              name, Rare Earths.</p>
            <p>In reality they are not particularly rare, although, ore bodies 
              large enough to mine are not particularly common. Cerium is thought 
              to comprise 60 ppm in the earths crust, whereas, copper is at 50 
              ppm. Yttrium is though to comprise 33 ppm and Neodymium 28 ppm.</p>
            <p>The lanthanides are more readily available as we have found more 
              uses for them, consequently, we have developed more economic refining 
              processes. In addition, they are now available at lower purity levels, 
              i.e. 99% for ceramics, whereas, other applications may require 99.9999%. 
            </p>
            <p>We now come across the lanthanides in a wide range of applications:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> More powerful motors can be produced with neodymium permanent 
                magnets.</li>
              <li> Tantalum is used in the electronics industry especially mobile 
                phones.</li>
              <li> Large quantities of neodymium and praseodymium are use as glass 
                colorants.</li>
              <li> Cerium oxide is used in catalytic converts for petrol cars.</li>
              <li> Yttrium oxide in oxygen probes.</li>
              <li> Erbium in optical devices such as night vision goggles, laser 
                beams and fibre optics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><img src="images/lanthanides/Praseodymium_Oxide.jpg" alt="Praseodymium Oxide" width="100" height="100" align="left">Praseodymium 
              Oxide</strong><br>
              Praseodymium was discovered in 1885 by Aver von Welsbach. Its name 
              comes from the Greek prasios meaning green and didymos meaning twin.</p>
            <p>It comes as a black powder with a particle size in the range 5 
              to 15 microns. The ceramics grade is 99% pure and its primary uses 
              are for coloring glass and ceramic glazes. We believe that it has 
              been used in stains such as yellow 28CY4.</p>
            <p>In glazes it produces transparent green colors.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><img src="images/lanthanides/Neodymium_Oxide.jpg" alt="Neodymium Oxide" width="100" height="100" align="left">Neodymium 
              Oxide</strong><br>
              Neodymium was only discovered in 1925 by Aver von Welsbach. It name 
              comes from the Greek neos meaning new and didymos meaning twin.</p>
            <p>It is available as a blue gray powder with a particle size range 
              of 1 to 10 micron. The ceramics grade is 99% pure and its primary 
              uses are coloring glass and ceramic glazes. In glazes it produces 
              blue to lavender colors. </p>
            <p><strong><img src="images/lanthanides/Erbium_Oxide.jpg" alt="Erbium Oxide" width="100" height="100" align="left">Erbium 
              Oxide</strong><br>
              Erbium was discovered in 1843 by Carl Mosander and named after Ytterby 
              in Sweden (?).</p>
            <p>It comes as pink powder with a particle size in the range 5 to 
              15 microns. It is used in optical devices, laser beams, phosphorescent 
              materials, as well as, a colorant for glass and ceramic glazes.</p>
            <p>In glazes it produces a stunning pink color.</p>
            <p><strong>Development Program</strong><br>
              Our objective was to develop an over view of the performance of 
              the oxides as glaze colorants. We wanted to assess their usefulness 
              to potters and whether we should proceed with them. We only had 
              limited quantities of the oxides available and had to make every 
              gram count. </p>
            <p>We undertook several simple preliminary test demonstrating that 
              the oxides could be fire at earthenware, mid-fire and stoneware. 
              Having satisfied ourselves that the work was worthwhile we proceeded 
              in toe assessment program. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong><br>
              We looked at the interaction of the colorants with a variety of 
              commonly used glaze fluxes. Glazes high in sodium, barium, calcium, 
              magnesium, lithium, boron, zinc were prepared. We did not bother 
              to produce a high quality glaze as our interest was only in the 
              effect on the colorants. We also used two commercial glazes, one 
              a clear stoneware and the other a clear mid fire.</p>
            <p>The colored glaze trials were brushed onto bisqued white stoneware 
              tiles and fired to 1280C in an electric kiln.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of the flux used we did not observe any significant 
              change in the color achieved.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Step 2</em></strong><br>
              Using the clear stoneware base we added oxide in the range 2.5 to 
              50%. Again the trials were fired in an electric kiln to stoneware. 
            </p>
            <p>Increasing the percentage of oxide only increased the intensity 
              of the color.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Step 3</em></strong><br>
              The literature suggested that small quantities of iron could intensify 
              the color achieved.</p>
            <p>Again using the clear stoneware base we added 10% of the Neodymium 
              oxide to produce GLAZE A. A batch of the stoneware glaze was blended 
              with the following quantities of traditional glaze colorants, GLAZES 
              B1 to B6 <br>
              Iron, 1%<br>
              Nickel, 1%<br>
              Tin, 3% <br>
              Copper, 1%<br>
              Cobalt, 0.5%<br>
              Vanadium, 2%</p>
            <p>The glaze mixtures were used to produce line blends as follows:</p>
            <p> Glaze A<br>
              8 parts Glaze A, 1 part Glaze B<br>
              8 parts Glaze A, 3 parts glaze B<br>
              8 parts glaze A, 5 parts glaze B<br>
              8 parts glaze A, 8 parts glaze B<br>
              Glaze B</p>
            <p>This was repeated for each oxide and each traditional colorant.</p>
            <p>In this trial the colored glaze was applied to bisqued Southern 
              Ice tiles and fired in an electric kiln to stoneware. A selection 
              was fired in reduction in a gas kiln.</p>
            <p>Firing in reduction does not appear to significantly effect the 
              color achieved.</p>
            <p>We did not observe that any of the colorants had an unexpected 
              effect on the oxides. Ideally we would have maintained the same 
              level of oxide in each trial, but we were limited to the material 
              available.</p>
            <p>The trials provide a starting point for further development.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Step 4</em></strong><br>
              The lanthanide oxides were mixed together to investigate the colors 
              that could be achieved. We applied our aesthetic judgment and did 
              not mix the pink and green oxides.</p>
            <p>Again the clear stoneware was used as a base and 10% of the lanthanide 
              oxide was added. The blended glazes were mixed in the following 
              ratios.</p>
            <p>4 parts Erbium glaze<br>
              3 parts erbium glaze and 1 part neodymium<br>
              2 parts erbium glaze and 2 parts neodymium<br>
              1 part erbium glaze and 3 parts neodymium<br>
              4 parts neodymium</p>
            <p>The sequence was repeated for the neodymium praseodymium blend.</p>
            <p>Again the glazes were applied to <a href="111000.html"><strong>Southern
              Ice</strong></a> tiles and fired to stoneware in an electric kiln.</p>
            <p>A stunning array of colors resulted</p>
            <p><strong>Safety</strong><br>
              There are several important factors to be considered, the oxides 
              are hydroscopic, i.e. they will absorb moisture from the atmosphere. 
              They will also absorb carbon dioxide, consequently, they should 
              be stored in air tight containers.</p>
            <p>All chemicals must be treated with respect and care. Good hygiene 
              should be adopted.</p>
            <p>Eye irritation has been observed in rabbits with dosages of 100mg.</p>
            <p>The LD 50 level for rats is 5 gms per kilogram of body weight, 
              i.e. 50% of the rats died at that level of ingestion. To put that 
              in perspective that dosage would require a person weighing 75kg 
              to consumer 375 gm. We do not know what dosage killed the first 
              rat.</p>
            <p>The oxides are considered non hazardous for transport by road, 
              ship or plane.</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
              An exciting range of rare earth glaze colorants - neodymium oxide, 
              praseodymium oxide and erbium oxide offer the opportunity to decorate 
              with transparent glazes in colors that could not be achieved from 
              other sources, especially at stoneware temperatures.</p>
            <p>The colors achieved appear to be unaffected by the glaze flux 
              used, firing temperature or whether it is fired in oxidation or 
              reduction.</p>
            <p>The oxides can be mixed to produce an even broader pallet of color.</p>
            <p>Our investigation has only touched the surface we have not considered 
              crystalline glazes or raku firing or whatever variation you can 
              imagine.</p>
            <p>Rare earth colorants may be obtained in the USA from <a href="http://www.lagunaclay.com"><strong>Laguna 
              Clay</strong></a> and in Australia from <a href="http://www.clayworksaustralia.com"><strong>Clayworks</strong>.</a><br>
