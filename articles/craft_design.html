            <p> </p>
            <p><b>Design on the ground</b><br>
              The focus of this discussion paper is on the realization of good 
              ideas in material form. To consider this seriously, we need to put 
              aside some of the more fashionable associations with design.</p>
            <p>This focus requires us to think beyond the superficial glamour 
              of design. Sometimes, the success of design can be its own enemy. 
              Design is often tied to fashion as a field of consumption with a 
              rapid turnover of styles and innovation. As such, design is often 
              prey to the kind of mystification necessary to grant fashionable 
              items with appealing aura. The world of design contains an assortment 
              of &#8216;gurus&#8217;, &#8216;superstars&#8217; and &#8216;trend 
              forecasters&#8217;.</p>
            <p>The design aura is an obvious advantage to those wanting to give 
              their products extra value and protect their intellectual capital. 
              It is reasonable for designers to develop their &#8216;brand identity&#8217; 
              as much as their &#8216;product&#8217;. The strategy of a &#8216;design 
              showcase&#8217; is an established vehicle for developing reputation 
              across the state.</p>
            <p>But this aura relates to the external appeal of design. Inside 
              the world of design there exists a much more practical business 
              of material processes. The danger of looking only at the outside 
              is that design is treated as an &#8216;elixir&#8217; that magically 
              confers status on its beholder. It is in this situation that those 
              aspiring to design kudos may be vulnerable to superficial solutions.[1] 
              A whole class of &#8216;designer professionals&#8217; might emerge 
              who swap tales about their successes in the glamorous centers. Such 
              design would be cut off from the rest of society and provide an 
              enclave for a fashionable elite, still beholden to overseas trends. 
              The kind of design encouraged in this insular milieu consists of 
              mercurial conceptual leaps and cool elegance.</p>
            <p>&#8216;Design&#8217; has such wide distribution now that its status 
              is in danger. To avoid design becoming a &#8216;cargo cult&#8217;, 
              consideration needs to be given to design&#8217;s roots in the local 
              skill base. </p>
            <p><b>The relationship between craft and design</b><br>
              As many recognize, the terms &#8216;craft&#8217; and &#8216;design&#8217; 
              rest on a continuum. For the purposes of this discussion, the continuum 
              is understood as the degree of responsibility by the individual 
              for the physical construction of a work. In the case of craft, it 
              is assumed that an individual has made the work him- or herself, 
              whether by hand or machine. An example is a potter throwing a vessel. 
              In contrast, design is often executed by others. An example is an 
              architect drawing plans for builders. The differences between craft 
              and design are evident on a number of dimensions:</p>
            <p><b>Skill versus creativity</b><br>
              Producing an object requires both skill and creativity. While encouraging 
              creativity, craft tends to emphasize the skill of the practitioner. 
              The field of craft contains a collective bank of skills accrued 
              over millennia. In design, it is creativity which tends to be most 
              valued. The history of design is partly told in the imaginative 
              leaps made by individual designers. </p>
            <p>What &#8216;craft&#8217; and &#8216;design&#8217; share in common 
              is a little harder to define. Craft refers most readily to arts 
              using a specific group of materials&#8212;clay, metals, wood, glass 
              and fibre. The products are mostly objects of use, such as vessels, 
              furniture and bodily adornment. Design includes a much broader range 
              of arts, including architecture, industrial design, fashion, graphics, 
              interiors and multimedia. In recent years, design has been grafted 
              on to craft mainly through furniture. In furniture production, the 
              physical capacities of makers are more likely to be limited, and 
              labor more readily outsourced. </p>
            <p>The differences between craft and design are largely complementary. 
              Each supplements a lack in the other. </p>
            <p><b> Organic versus synthetic</b><br>
              These days, design is often associated with synthetic materials, 
              such as acrylics, which are more amenable to industrial processes 
              like injection molding. By contrast, craft often privileges organic 
              materials that require more skill in construction, such as wood 
              turning or weaving. In these works, the skill of the maker is incorporated 
              into the value of the object.</p>
            <p><b>One-off versus multiple</b><br>
              Design tends to be associated with multiples. Apart from architecture, 
              it is rare to find design associated with one-off works. There are 
              certainly cases, however, when craft practitioners do make multiples, 
              and engage assistance in their workshop to fulfil a production batch.</p>
            <p><b>Expressive versus consumer</b><br>
              One critical difference between craft and design is the gallery 
              context. Craft tends to be closer to the visual arts as an expressive 
              medium, through which the maker attempts to make a personal statement. 
              Design is more likely to be approached as a consumable item&#8212;something 
              to be purchased rather than admired in its own right. In the case 
              of personal gifts, the dimensions of expression and consumption 
              overlap. Here, the care involved in handmade process adds symbolic 
              value to the object, which ideally reflects the meaning of the relationship 
              that the gift represents. </p>
            <p><b>The craft and design partnership</b> <br>
              As a result of these differences, it is feasible for individual 
              practitioners to move between craft and design: craft provides opportunities 
              for individual expression while design offers economies of scale. 
              There is a natural partnership between the two fields.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, craft is often perceived as having a lower status 
              than design. This is partly because of its association with recreational 
              pursuits and weekend markets. But the ground of this low status 
              is largely outmoded. The very imperfections that gave the handmade 
              lower status are now signs of distinction. Most weekend markets 
              now contain little craft, as its recreational pursuit is declining 
              with the growth of home entertainment. As craft becomes less common 
              its value rises, particularly among the exclusive end of the market.</p>
            <p>There is in our culture a stream of thought that underestimates 
              the importance of craft in creativity. It is important to identify 
              this line of thinking in order not to be beholden to it.</p>
            <p><b>The Platonic legacy</b><br>
              One of the main dichotomies of Western civilization divides the 
              world of action from that of contemplation. Since the time of Plato, 
              it has been nobler to think than to do. The philosopher Hannah Arendt 
              noted that the &#8216;primacy of contemplation over activity&#8217; 
              was based on the Aristotelian foundation of the Christian church, 
              which saw truth as achieved &#8216;in the complete human stillness&#8217;.[2] 
              Opposed to this is the figure of homo faber, the maker of things:</p>
            <p>&#8230;writing something down, painting an image, modeling a figure, 
              or composing a melody is of course related to the thought which 
              preceded it, but what actually makes the thought a reality and fabricates 
              things of thought is the same workmanship which, through the primordial 
              instrument of human hands, builds the other durable things of human 
              artifice.[3]</p>
            <p>Over the course of Western history, the argument between thought 
              and action has taken some dramatic turns. The Reformation opposed 
              the idleness of the priestly classes to the honest labor of the 
              common people. This ideology was echoed in the Arts &amp; Crafts 
              Movement of the late nineteenth century, which provided the philosophical 
              basis for craft in the English-speaking world. But these movements 
              are often counterpoints to the forces of abstraction in modernity 
              that distance us from the physical world.</p>
            <p>Other cultures often see it differently. In Asian societies, such 
              as Japan, masters of their craft are often revered as national treasures.</p>
            <p>In contemporary Australia (and the West; ed. note), a status hierarchy 
              persists that places those who work at desks above those who work 
              at a bench. The great exception to this is sport, where the physical 
              energy and skill of individuals is lauded above their cleverness. 
            </p>
            <p>In the future, it is likely that our historical prejudice against 
              the active life will be tempered by the rarity of manual labor As 
              automated processes replace a great proportion of physical work, 
              operating with our hands becomes a rare and highly prized capacity. 
              Today with software packages like PhotoShop, there is relatively 
              minimal technical skill needed to design something impressive. When 
              such resources become common, we renew our appreciation of an individual&#8217;s 
              drawing skills. </p>
            <p>When questioning the contemporary relevance of craft, it is important 
              to understand our historical prejudice against the active life. 
              This prejudice can blinker our vision as to the continuing and growing 
              relevance of hand skills in the construction of our material world. 
            </p>
            <p>While the prejudice against craft might occur in segments of the 
              population, is appears to be reversed in the design world itself.</p>
            <p><b>Craft adds value to design</b><br>
              An alternative way of understanding the role of craft in design 
              is to look at the language used to describe its activity. In this 
              instance craft is regularly referenced as a value that adds quality 
              to design.</p>
            <p>A recent interview with eminent design retailer, R. G. Madden, 
              highlights the critical role of craft. In discussing the weakness 
              of the design culture of the USA, he notes the lack of relationship 
              between mass production and craft process: &#8216;They still haven&#8217;t 
              got that nexus between the two whereas the factories in Italy have 
              come from a craft base of over a hundred years ago and now work 
              with mass production&#8212;but still have a lot of style about them.&#8217;[4]</p>
            <p>A recent article[5] by design retailer Ross Longmuir (Planet Furniture) 
              argues that designs are very easily imitated, reducing the value 
              of the product with economies of scale. By contrast, the skill and 
              understanding of materials possessed by those involving in making 
              the product cannot be easily copies. This is particularly the case 
              in the use of local materials such as indigenous timbers. He writes: 
              &#8216;It is in the interests of the mainstream to support craft 
              practice as a resource that they regularly draw from and I think 
              that this should be the angle that is pushed for crafts-people to 
              be involved in a design led re-energising of the whole sector.&#8217;</p>
            <p>The follow are some examples of how design is promoted on the basis 
              of its craft value:</p>

              in the ASIS&amp;T-sponsored series of conferences that are the largest 
              dedicated meeting places for information architecture professionals.</p>
            <p>Many famous designers attribute their success to craft training.</p>
            <p>British designer Alexander McQueen puts on such spectacular shows 
              that they achieve the level of performance art. The youngest of 
              six children of an East End cabbie, McQueen wanted to be a fashion 
              designer from age three and describes himself as &#8216;the pink 
              sheep&#8217; of the family. He may be a fanciful designer, but he 
              is also a superb technician, attributing his success to the craft 
              skills he acquired as an apprentice on Savile Row. [8]</p>
            <p>The success of design is attributed most often to a craft base.</p>
            <p><b>The case of Marc Newson</b><br>
              Marc Newson is Australia&#8217;s most celebrated designer. An interview 
              in Monument magazine highlights the priority the Newson gives to 
              craft as the basis for successful design. Newson describes himself 
              as &#8216;craft&#8212;100 percent&#8217;. While he is often given 
              the &#8216;style over substance&#8217; tag&#8230;</p>
            <p>On the contrary, of far greater significance to Newson is his training 
              as a jeweler and he cites this direct craft-based experience of 
              materials as the defining feature of all his work. &#8220;I was 
              always interested in process and materials. I&#8217;m not really 
              that interested in the process of creation so much as the process 
              of learning about how things work and function.&#8221;[9]</p>
            <p>In a recent article about Australian design in Japan, Newson commented: 
              &#8216;Japan is the ultimate place for a designer to hone their 
              craft because the Japanese culture is just so predisposed to detail&#8217;[10]</p>
            <p><b>The case of Milan</b><br>
              The current design initiative in Victoria is modeled on the strength 
              of design culture in Milan. </p>
            <p>What needs to be understood is that this success is based on the 
              existence of many smaller craft-based workshops that provide the 
              skill and experience necessary for innovation. Alessi is a key example 
              of how a sustainable design enterprise is based on a deep history 
              of artisanal skill.</p>
            <p><b>The case of Tokyo</b><br>
              The talents of individuals such as top fashion designer Issey Miyake 
              are grounded on knowledge of materials accumulated over centuries. 
              As he writes of Japanese design:</p>
            <p>The roots of Japanese contemporary design lie in the craft movement 
              before the war. After the war, rapid economic development allowed 
              local design to flourish, and directly impact on people's lives.[11]</p>
            <p><b>The case of Prague</b><br>
              In the new Czech Republic, new designs have been successful produced 
              in collaboration with established crafts. For instance, Nimeiek 
              and Fronik have incorporated the famous &#8216;tavernice&#8217; 
              technique of Czech glass into a distinct line of furniture.</p>
            <p><b>Where craft does not meet design</b><br>
              It must be conceded that there are aspects of craft that are largely 
              irrelevant to design. In some areas, craft remains a humanistic 
              art form that privileges the maker&#8217;s mark. Handmade ceramic 
              vessels or gold rings have an enduring quality that is linked to 
              the manual skills of the craft practitioner. These items will remain 
              of value as expressive goods. The presence of a brand or fashionable 
              designer label can detract from this personal meaning. When objects 
              are required for the exchange of symbolic value, such as wedding 
              gift or award trophy, the evidence of the hand is an index of the 
              care and value that is attached to the relationship it represents. 
            </p>
            <p>In the gallery, this form of expression is given more individual 
              scope in the production of non-utilitarian objects made purely for 
              the pleasure of the beholder. These are often end up in collections 
              by those connoisseurs of a particular medium or in institutional 
              collections representing the best of an age. Craft naturally lends 
              itself to themed exhibitions much better than design, which is usually 
              displayed in a showcase format.</p>
            <p>The priority given to design represents an exciting vision for 
              the future. To give this future full expression, it is critical 
              that craft play an active role.</p>
