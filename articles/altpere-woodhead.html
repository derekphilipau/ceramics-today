<p> <img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_1_0001.jpg" width="284" height="400" align="left">Crossing 
              borders and making use of techniques from other mediums is by no 
              means new to ceramics. This practice of borrowing has for centuries 
              allowed makers to enrich their visual and technical vocabulary and 
              achieve new and exciting aesthetic results. Whether used for commercial 
              production or individual artistic expression, various methods of 
              classical printmaking have been part of ceramics since the advent 
              of printing itself. </p>
            <p>I was first introduced to the possibilities of ceramic mono-printing 
              through the work of Norwegian artist Ole Lislerud, who has used 
              the technique to create monumental architectural artworks such as 
              the central portal in the Oslo Courthouse and the fa&ccedil;ade 
              of the Performing Arts Centre in &Aring;lesund, Norway. While impressive 
              in scale and technical mastery, it is the successful match between 
              concept, aesthetic objectives and a technical process that has inspired 
              me most about Lislerud&#8217;s work. During a student exchange to 
              the National College of Art and Design in Oslo in 1997, I had an 
              opportunity to study under his guidance and, among other things, 
              learn the basic principles of this method. However, it was only 
              in 2004, when I started working on the Moments in Black and White 
              series and exploring issues around personal emotional responses 
              to various environments, that I returned to the mono-printing technique.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_2_0001.jpg" width="286" height="205"></p>
            <p>Ever since moving to Australia from Estonia in the Northern Hemisphere 
              in 1992, I have been intrigued by the ways recollections of other 
              places influence and inform one&#8217;s relationship with present 
              surrounds. As new impressions are embedded into the existing web 
              of sentiment and experience, the boundaries between past and present, 
              old and new become blurred. Familiarity is found or formed through 
              elusive associations with occurrences from the past and these associations 
              themselves change from context to context. Likewise, memories and 
              meanings are created and re-created, arranged and re-arranged in 
              a process with no finite beginning or end nor a set hierarchical 
              order.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_2_0004.jpg" width="222" height="170" hspace="2"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_2_0002.jpg" width="214" height="170" hspace="2"></p>
            <p>The Moments in Black and White series is a materialised reflection 
              of personal meaning, making and memory processes. It consists of 
              an open-ended number of small cylindrical mono-printed porcelain 
              forms that can be assembled randomly or selectively, separating 
              and banding them together, swapping from group to group. I have 
              limited myself to a monochromatic black and white colour scheme 
              and a basic cylindrical form. Starting with these basics has allowed 
              me to gradually develop more complexity and diversity both in terms 
              of form and surface imagery while maintaining a sense of coherence 
              between individual pieces. While the diameter of the cylinders remains 
              more or less constant, their height and rims vary, creating movement 
              and visual rhythm in different assemblages. Likewise, the colour-palette 
              accommodates a wide range of subtle &#8216;colour greys&#8217; that 
              result from both the make up of the coloured slips and variations 
              in firing atmosphere.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_2_0003.jpg" width="211" height="170" hspace="2"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_3_0001.jpg" width="202" height="170" hspace="2"></p>
            <p>The method of mono-printing that I use combines elements of classical 
              intaglio printing and monotype. This combination has allowed me 
              to express the constant change and unpredictability of memories 
              as they move in and out of our consciousness, as well as involve 
              the element of familiarity. On the one hand it utilises the spontaneous 
              painterly qualities of monotype and its uniqueness among other printing 
              techniques as a means of producing only one print of an image. On 
              the other hand, it borrows from the classical intaglio techniques 
              in which the imagery is incised into the printing plate, resulting 
              in a print that replicates the graphic markings or textures of the 
              plate and has the potential of seriality.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_3_0002.jpg" width="212" height="170" hspace="2"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_3_0003.jpg" width="211" height="170" hspace="2"></p>
            <p>For printing I use a number of plaster slabs that have been cast 
              on to glass or smooth melamine surface. The slabs are all the same 
              size (40 x 40 cm) and 2 cm thick. First I cover the even surface 
              of the slabs with incised linear designs. Any sharp metal implements 
              such as used fine ballpoint pens, the tip of a knife or saw blades 
              can be used for carving. Wiping the slab with a damp sponge changes 
              the definition and quality of the carved lines and makes the carving 
              easier as the plaster softens and is more responsive. Because of 
              the superbly sensitive nature of cast plaster, every alteration 
              to it becomes visible. However, as plaster is also soft, markings 
              will lose definition and even disappear with subsequent prints. 
              These clashing qualities make working with plaster slabs both challenging 
              and fascinating and I often keep using and rotating the same plaster 
              plates over and over again, sometimes way beyond their practical 
              use. Working the plates by altering or adding new markings to the 
              already existing and fading ones enables me to make a record of 
              change, as images appear, metamorphose and gradually disappear while 
              all along retaining traces of their former identity. Once the printed 
              images are exposed to the irreversibly transformative force of fire, 
              this record of change becomes permanent. After carving, the surface 
              needs to be cleaned thoroughly with a dry brush and damp sponge 
              to remove any fine plaster particles before applying clay slip. 
              I always discard the first cast from every new slab as it may contain 
              impurities such as soap scum or plaster dust, and let the plaster 
              dry completely. Before applying the first layer of clay slip, the 
              carved slab is wiped briefly with a damp sponge. Then, using a wide 
              soft flat brush, the entire surface of the slab is evenly covered 
              with a coloured slip. I usually work with a number of brushes and 
              keep those that I use for darker colours separate from the ones 
              for lighter colours. As soon as the slip has lost its sheen it can 
              be scraped off using a wide straight blade, leaving slip only in 
              the carved lines. Over this matrix of graphic markings I start applying 
              layers of coloured slips, scraping parts of them back much like 
              in classical monotype. It is a spontaneous and rather intuitive 
              process as I keep covering previous layers while working on the 
              composition from front to back. As the surface imagery is built 
              up layer by layer it also becomes an integral structural component 
              for the resulting forms, being embedded in their walls.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_3_0004.jpg" width="293" height="237"></p>
            <p>Once the composition is finished, four 2 cm wide and 3-4 mm thick 
              masonite strips are placed along the edges of the plaster slab. 
              These will hold the liquid slip in place while the backing slab 
              is being cast. To cast the backing slab I measure a required amount 
              of stirred casting slip into a pouring jug. While tilting the slab 
              with one hand I pour the slip on to the slab, starting from the 
              centre top and moving from side to side. Tilting the slab forces 
              the slip flow downwards and avoids &#8216;casting lines&#8217; which 
              may cause cracking. Once the slab is covered to desired thickness, 
              it is placed on a level surface and the slip left to set. As soon 
              as the cast slip loses its sheen, the masonite strips are removed 
              and the slightly raised edges trimmed with a sharp knife. At this 
              point I need to work swiftly as the cast slab will lose plasticity 
              quickly and become unsuitable for further shaping. To release the 
              printed sheet, I first carefully lift the corners by easing them 
              from plaster with a thin flat blade. Holding gently but firmly from 
              two top corners, the cast porcelain slab is turned over on to a 
              clean board and the printed image revealed. While the entire process 
              is not complex there is always an element of accident and surprise 
              that, together with the changes that occur during firing, can alter 
              the original idea dramatically.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/Altpere-Woodhead//Altpere-Woodhead_4_0001.jpg" width="337" height="236"></p>
            <p>After removing the printed slab from the plaster, it is cut into 
              segments and shaped into cylinders of various heights. This fragmentation 
              of the printed image creates an aspect of continuation between individual 
              pieces and a sense of movement in the groupings of otherwise static 
              objects. The sense of extension is emphasised by the fact that I 
              reuse and rotate the plaster slabs and while each printed image 
              is different they share certain visual elements. The combination 
              of a painterly imagery superimposed with textured and defined graphic 
              markings resulting from this mono-printing technique allows for 
              the construction of complex yet undefined visual spaces with permeable 
              layered depth. While the surfaces of the printed forms in the Moments 
              in Black and White series can be read as a reference to landscape 
              or natural environment, it is not intended as literal representation 
              of any particular location. Rather, it is to act as a trigger for 
              various abstract associations with natural phenomena and cultural 
              expressions. The tactile contrast between the slightly raised relief 
              of the lines against the smooth satiny surface invites the viewer 
              to pick up the pieces, feel and examine them closely and then reposition 
              them, creating different compositions. It is through these personal 
              responses that the work gains new meanings, taking the original 
              idea to another level.</p>
