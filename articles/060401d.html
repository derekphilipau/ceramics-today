            <p> <b>Industrial Firing Processes</b> 
            <p> This section comprises a very brief overview of industrial ceramic 
              firing methods. The information mostly relates to larger plants 
              firing bricks and tiles. The most up to date information is available 
              from your local industrial kiln manufacturer or technical ceramic 
              sites on the web, listed on the <b><a href="../links/industrial.html">Industrial 
              Ceramics page</a></b>. 
            <p> If you are require faster turnaround times and high throughputs, 
              the best approach is to fire with forced air burners. This system 
              utilizes sealed, usually high velocity, burners fed with clean gas 
              and pressurized air from an air blower. There is a design in a well 
              known ceramic paperback that uses a single forced air burner on 
              a small batch type studio kiln but typically, for capital cost recovery, 
              the kiln would need to be a minimum of 3-5 m3 or was fired every 
              second day to consider this application. 
            <ul>
              <li> <i>Forced air burners</i><br>
                produce: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Fast firings 
                  <li>Accurate control of the air and gas ratio through the firing. 
                    (This is due to non reliance on atmospheric primary air for 
                    initial combustion and secondary air through flue draw to 
                    complete it.) 
                  <li>High efficiencies through preheating combustion air, reuse 
                    of flue gasses for dryers and rapid firings 
                  <li>High velocity convection forcing the water from the product 
                    and evenly heating all sections of a load <br>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                Forced air burners, due to the capability of forcing relatively 
                high volumes of combustion products into the kiln space in a short 
                time, must have rapid shut down safety systems. It is this requirement 
                that can increase the cost together with fully automatic start, 
                programmable temperature controllers and accurate burner control 
                valves that are usually specified for maximum benefit.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li><i>Die Composition</i><br>
                As expected ceramic compositions and development of ceramics is 
                advancing apace. Covering of wear prone parts such as auger and 
                mixer blades and press dies with ceramic materials is showing 
                promise. Fully ceramic parts or more widespread use of PSZ should 
                be commercially viable by now. Compositions of zircon and alumina 
                silicates show promise in certain areas.<br>
                <br>
                Dies are either the usual high chrome steel or newer ceramic coated 
                for longer life. Steel dies would be able to be machined 5 or 
                6 times prior to replacement, the ceramic dies usually have several 
                pieces and can last much longer.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li><i>Dryers</i><br>
                Thorough drying of the product is crucial for fast firing. Most 
                industrial processes use waste heat from the kiln however a heat 
                boost is required in the drying section. It would follow that 
                the efficiency of the kiln process might be lower than is possible 
                if a boost is not required as there would be excessive heat loss 
                from the kiln section. If excessive water vapor is formed in the 
                drying, increase the heat to overcome or increase the recirculating 
                air volume.<br>
                The usual drying arrangement uses air fans and gas ducted burners 
                to move the heated air (typically 110° C) through the product. 
                Jet drying is favored by some and this consists of higher pressures 
                (typically 8 meter/sec.) forcing the heated air through a slotted 
                side wall in the dryer. In some the slotted wall moves back and 
                forth to distribute the air even more thoroughly. An ideal drying 
                system would have the air delivery arranged to suit the product 
                i.e. horizontal slots for thinner tiles. <br>

                <p align="left"><i>Fast Firing</i><br>
                  Most modern high throughput tile or brick kilns are tunnel kilns. 
                  These have been around for a while now and replaced the earlier 
                  "Hoffman" kilns (continuous kilns relying on continuous draw 
                  of combustion products through the load) as these did not give 
                  the efficiencies or evenness of temperature required for modern 
                  processes. <br>
                  <br>
                  The German Keller company uses tunnel kilns with multiple high 
                  velocity burners, special "cassettes" and cars designed to hold 
                  tiles and other products to allow efficient heat transfer and 
                  convection. Keller provides a total approach with savings on 
                  staff, work area taken into the total savings figure. Typical 
                  firings with multilayer stacks (typically 12 tiles high and 
                  wide) are approx. 8 hours versus the usual 20 or more hours 
                  in previous tunnel kiln plants although these vary from product 
                  to product. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Italian Mori company pioneered the "roller kiln" using ceramic 
                  rollers to propel the product through the kiln in a single layer 
                  at fast speeds. This is a common concept in the steel industry 
                  but has developed in the heavy clay area as cheaper and stronger 
                  ceramics have become available. Typically 2-3 hour firings for 
                  tiles would be expected with 30 minute firings for domestic 
                  ware. The key is in the kiln design, the number of burners and 
                  placement for extremely even temperatures (the product must 
                  be heated at the same rate) and, most importantly, the composition 
                  of the body. This is formulated to withstand the stress and 
                  the rapid cool to hot to cool cycle. Mori would supply two kilns 
                  if more product was required but the newer Mori concept has 
                  several layers of shelves moving on rollers located on the kiln 
                  side in between three burner layers. To support the weight across 
                  the 1.5 or 2 meter width the tile cassette is made from exotic 
                  alloys. This idea may not be commercially viable yet due to 
                  the high alloy cost. <br>
                  <br>
                  Both applications utilize many high velocity burners located 
                  above and below the stack for minimum temperature differential. 
                  Typically a kiln of this design would have 2-4° C difference 
                  in any part of the firing area at 1160° C. These tunnel kilns 
                  also have quite low stacks typically 600-750 mm high to achieve 
                  rapid transfer to the load. Low thermal mass insulation or interlocking 
                  refractory tiles are used and the impression of the kiln is 
                  quite small due to the smaller casing size and the reduced length 
                  of the tunnel. There is rapid forced cooling at the tunnel end 
                  with an air curtain to contain the heat loss. Flues are typically 
                  under the cars towards the drying end with facility for recirculating.
