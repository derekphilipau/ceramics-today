<h3>Ceramic Sculpture in Europe</h3>
		Dateline:01/27/97<P>

In ceramics one can broadly distinguish two distinct categories: 'functional' work, meaning such ceramics that can be used in the household (although there is plenty of one-off artistic work around that is in a sense functional but is meant to be purely decorative). Then there is 'ceramic sculpture', where the artist uses clay to express sculptural, artistic or socio-critical ideas.<P>
In art institutions ceramic sculpture inhabits a peculiar place -the question coming from students and lecturers of scuplture departments often being "if you are making sculpture, why restrict yourself to a particular medium such as clay?" But you have to work with clay to appreciate its seductive properties.<P>

Ceramic sculpture in Europe enjoys a long tradition going back hundreds of years. The work of <STRONG><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/saba67753/einfhru.html">Sabine Bach</A></STRONG> strongly reflects this tradition in the appropriation of the gothic style of the middle ages. Sabine obviously enjoys a rich medevial fantasy which finds expression in her <STRONG><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/saba67753/drachen.html">Dragons</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/saba67753/medusa.html">Medusas and Unicorns</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/saba67753/sphinx.html">Demons and Sphinxs</A></STRONG>.

<!--<STRONG><a href="http://www.loria.fr/AN/EN/galle-ceramique.html">Emile Gallï¿½</A> </STRONG>(1846-1904) was a French ceramic artist who lived in Nancy from 1846 - 1904. He was particularly interested in animal sculpture. There is also some 'functional' work to be found here, which illustrates the often found diversity of ceramic artists expressing themselves in different ways.<P>

<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.gdv.com/Wenz/"> Dorthy Wenz's colorful quirky sculptures</A></STRONG> reveal an interesting interpretation of the human body. Some earlier works -mainly just as colorful bottles- are also to be seen. Especially interesting is the transition Dorothy has made from the vessel to sculpture, as seen in the 'Objects' (from the series 'From Vessel to Sculpture'). (This is a German language site).<P>
<!--In <STRONG><a href="http://hp710.iit.unict.it/dani/wwwing1.html">'Tradition, Ritual &amp; Symbolism in Mediterranean Ceramics'</a></STRONG> Daniela Ricci gives expression to her femininity with her terracotta sculptural vessels. Daniela leads us on an excursion through realms of masculinity, femininty, fusions of the two and explores the 'womb' and more.<P>
Not only does this site lead us back to a fusion between the 'functional' and 'non-functional', it is also conceptually based, a path that is perhaps taken too little in ceramic art.-->
