        article by Reid Harvey

        n Swahili, the Lingua Franca of East Africa, the word 'safari' means journey. 
        For the past two years I have been on a safari with East African ceramists: 
        an adventure in technology transfer. The journey started with a year in 
        the Sudan, working with a Women in Development (WID) Project for the United 
        Nations. It has continued with ceramists in Kenya. Several side trips 
        to Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea led to ceramic opportunities and environmental 
        issues. As the journey started, it was 47° C in the shade, a hot dry wind 
        burned, stirring up a dust storm, called a 'haboob' in Arabic. More than 
        once we saw bright daylight plunged into utter darkness by these haboobs. 
        Sudan's dry season lasts 10 months without a drop of rain. With the desert 
        here advancing at the rate of seven kilometers per year, one wonders if 
        ceramics is viable. Enter technology transfer. 
      <p> When first arriving in western Sudan, I noticed near our vocational 
        school in El Obeid, a number of wood burning clamp kilns. But our WID 
        project aimed at training women for extra income generation in various 
        ceramic techniques, starting with hand building tableware. Unfortunately, 
        lack of resources and support cut this project short. My 26 students worked 
        for four months and acquired basic ceramic skills, but it is doubtful 
        that any of these daughters of the desert had been able to pick up the 
        design and marketing skills needed to continue working. 
      <p> <img align=left src="../images/safari2.jpg" width="105" height="484" hspace="8"><i>Left: 
        The half-built, vertical tunnel kiln of the Building and Road Research 
        Institute of Khartoum University.</i> 
      <p> On the outskirts of Khartoum, 600 million bricks are produced annually. 
        As in much of Africa, building materials are in short supply and will 
        be produced at any environmental cost. In an insidious crisis, countless 
        bricks are being poorly formed, then under-fired in inefficient wood burning 
        clamp kilns. These poor quality bricks are produced not only around Khartoum 
        but throughout Sudan and Africa. 
      <p> It was hard for me to concentrate when talking to brick makers and builders. 
        I wanted to suggest: Try adobe, try stabilized earth blocks. But habits 
        die hard. Consumers with a little money want their bricks fired. Formed 
        with soft mud, they quickly lose their shape and because of this, they 
        cannot be properly stacked in the kiln and must be piled close together. 
        Heating is by conduction, not convection, resulting in the bricks being 
        nearly raw. Often, when driving home, I would deliberately run over bricks 
        that had dropped from a transport truck on to the road. My curiosity as 
        to quality always got the same answer: the bricks would crumble to dust. 
      <p> I felt that the public deserved a stronger, longer lasting product. 
        The most appropriate solution was to provide an energy-efficient kiln 
        and teach workers how to make a better brick. Working with Khartoum University's 
        Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI), I adapted and built an Asian 
        vertical tunnel kiln. The BRRI's kiln will fire the bricks made on the 
        production line of the brick plant which they own and operate. The fuel 
        will be carbonized agricultural-waste and is made in a similar way that 
        charcoal is prepared from wood but, importantly, it is made from cotton 
        stalks, sunflower stalks or bagasse. These carbonized fuels, reduced to 
        a granular size, are dispersed among the bricks when loading the kiln 
        from the top. Every hour the brick is lowered by one batch, using a chain 
        pulley system. 
      <p> The vertical tunnel kiln is energy efficient because incoming bricks 
        at the top of the kiln are preheated using the waste heat of its central 
        firing zone. Secondly, the brick stack is well insulated. This system 
        has been a success in Asia for more than 20 years. By comparison, other 
        types of brick kilns - the clamp, Hoffman and bull's trench kilns - waste 
        energy in preheating both their brick and their outer insulation. Hoffman 
        kilns are massive - looking down from the top, the firing follows a circuit 
        around the kiln's oval shape. Clamp kilns are just a pile of bricks with 
        an opening underneath for the fuel. Often the clamp has no permanent walls 
        - mud is dabbed all around to help prevent leaks. The bull's trench is 
        a hole in the ground in which fuel and brick are stacked then fired. Designed 
        to yield a batch of 180 bricks every hour, the vertical tunnel kiln will 
        produce nearly 1.5 million bricks annually. It is fired continuously for 
        11 months of the year, allowing for a month of maintenance. When production 
        greater than 1.5 million is needed, more kilns can be built. The total 
        cost of the BRRI's vertical tunnel kiln is about US$3000. Ironically, 
        this cost is so low that many aid donors will not consider funding it, 
        nor will many banks lend money.
