              can’t get away from those very strong fundamentals of process, because 
              if you try and cheat the system it never works. You can’t get away 
              with not doing the work, not following the process. You’ve got to 
              eat and sleep it. That’s how I work, totally involved in creating, 
              this Tanami Series I will have taken me more than a year to develop 
              as a major body of work. Its been fraught with a lot of technical 
              difficulties even last week I discovered that you can’t re-fire 
              the pot it will crack.&quot;</p>
          
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Pippin Drysdale, on the Tanami (desert) Traces 
              Series I August 2002 </p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For <a href="http://www.pippindrysdale.com/" target="_blank"><b>Pippin 
              Drysdale</b></a> technique always concerns continuous invention 
              and experiment; it is never about reliable elegance or repeatability. 
              The knife-edge presence of her painted forms emerges from an extended 
              process of experiment and improvising towards a particular remembered 
              sensation, a precise ‘expression of an experience’ as she puts it. 
              In this case the experience was a plane trip across central Australia 
              in and around the Tanami Desert region taken as part of a recent 
              fellowship from Arts Western Australia.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Australian artists have often use of the airplane 
              view as a painterly convention, a means to compose their gesture 
              landscapes in a flat plane. Perhaps because Drysdale is a potter 
              she saw the land differently, as a challenge to make elegant subtly 
              shifting irregular patterns, graft across the curved ceramic surface. 
              She was fascinated by the subtle traces of the land its forms and 
              shadows as they slid down slowly from the horizon, pink at sunset, 
              deepest blue green at dawn.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It demanded major changes in her working method 
              to evoke this in a ceramic form with an independent presence, an 
              autonomous beauty. It took seven months of experiment with her assistant 
              Warrick Palmateer, who throws her pots to develop an appropriate 
              shape from hundreds of small ‘ maquettes, each a slightly different 
              in shape. Her previous series had used wide bowl shapes or occasionally 
              a tight cylindrical profile both of which were suitable for a radically 
              expressive, painterly approach to colors and glazes. Now she had 
              to abandon the immediate spontaneity of earlier work. In this case 
              the curvature required a greater subtly, the lip of the vessels 
              are more precise relation to the volume and the cross section so 
              that the space implied by its outer surface would unfold slowly 
              to the inner eye.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vessels must also be able to hold a tightly 
              disciplined system of highly crafted lines and stains, unlike the 
              nebulous forms in her recent work which were achieved almost entirely 
              buy a mixture of wax or latex resists and glazes calculated to achieve 
              a semi predictable drift across the surface, a specific density 
              or translucency on firing. The creation of the new form went hand 
              in hand with the development of a new type of crumbling, linear 
              decoration that wrapped round the vessel like rough woven raw silk. 
              Over time form and decoration slowly fused into one, a single inevitable 
              presence arose, from hundreds of possibilities judged inadequate 
              to the intensity of the original experience. Drysdale kept detailed, 
              but informal, notes during this long process.. . mainly in the form 
              of ‘notes to myself as to what to do next-</p>

              I started this body, I found it very hard to visualize what I wanted. 
              I find mostly the way I work is with a physical form. I have to 
              make it see it and have a process of elimination. This doesn’t work, 
              that doesn’t work, and then yes this one’s got something, lets work 
              with this and move on to next problem. The form evolves over seven 
              or eight months. I learned to keep the base physically heavy and 
              use a sense of gravity. I wanted the form to be quite beautiful 
              in itself to float and have tension.&quot;</p>
