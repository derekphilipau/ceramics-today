                  <p>In ancient times potters did not have clay suppliers to 
                    provide them with raw materials for their glazes and clay 
                    bodies. They had to find, collect and process all the materials 
                    that they needed to produce their pottery from their local 
                    environment. This may have meant digging clay from the river 
                    bank, grinding up feldspar from an outcropping or collecting 
                    ashes from the fire pit. The result was that potters in one 
                    area had distinctly different clay and glazes from potters 
                    only a hundred miles away. </p>
                  <p>Today, because of private property laws, it is more difficult 
                    to run out and start mining local clay from your neighbor&#8217;s 
                    yard. But there are other sources of ceramic raw materials 
                    available to the modern potters that are both locally available 
                    and already processed. They are in the products we use everyday, 
                    which are sold in hardware, grocery or discount super stores.</p>
                  <p>These materials are similar to the ones that our ancestors 
                    used for their clay and glazes but they are processed for 
                    other uses that are more relevant to our daily societal needs, 
                    like antacids, cat litter, sunscreen, toothpaste, etc. The 
                    trade off is that, although we may not be getting the same 
                    regionally unique materials our ancestors did, we do have 
                    a readily available source of uniformly processed raw materials 
                    with little or no effort. We just have to have our credit 
                    cards available. Using products intended for other uses to 
                    create glazes, a potter can still come up with a unique and 
                    interesting palate of colors and surfaces and at the same 
                    time learn about material properties and their interactions 
                    in glazes. </p>

            <p>To create glazes the traditional way you need some basic building 
              blocks: clay, feldspar, silica, whiting, dolomite, talc, colorants, 
              etc. The same is true when you are creating glazes from store bought 
              products. A simple reading of the ingredients list will reveal that 
              many of the products we use contain high quantities of clay, silica, 
              feldspar, etc. The difficulty can be finding sources of pure materials 
              because one product may contain several ingredients. But that is 
              no different from the problem our ancestors face had when they dug 
              materials from the ground. It simply requires a series of tests 
              to determine what combinations will make suitable glazes.</p>
       
            <p>First we must find sources of the basic building blocks of a glaze. 
              Clay is available in many products, a major one being cat litter 
              which, in America, is usually coarsely ground Missouri fire clay. 
              This is a very consistent and inexpensive source of clay for your 
              glazes and it comes in handy 20 pound bags. You could also select 
              the clumping type of cat litter that contains bentonite. Bentonite 
              is a type of clay that, when wet, swells up to 50 times its volume. 
              This is added to cat litter so that after the cat has used the box 
              the owner can easily identify the obvious swelling clumps that need 
              to be removed. This type of cat litter is great to use in glazes 
              because it helps keep the glazes well suspended. Clay is also present 
              in many other products including make-up and &#8220;mud masks,&#8221; 
              but using these products to make glazes can to be very expensive.

            <p>Feldspars are available in the hardware or paint store in the form 
              of a sanding medium called &#8220;rottenstone&#8221; and &#8220;pumice 
              stone.&#8221; Essentially these are very finely ground (325 mesh) 
              iron bearing feldspars. The pumice stone can be used to make a wonderful 
              green celadon glaze while the rottenstone, which has more iron, 
              makes great temmokus and caramel colored kakis. A nice thing about 
              the rottenstone is that it contains magnesium oxide, which produces 
              wonderful satin surfaces. If you cannot find the ground pumice stone 
              it is also available in a block form that is used to remove corns 
              and calluses from the feet. This can be ground by hand to provide 
              a coarser mesh feldspar.</p>
            <p>Silica is a little difficult to find in its pure state in products 
              sold for uses other than glazes. But it is used in many products 
              such as, toothpaste, cleanser, desiccants (gel bags in electronic 
              products) and insecticides. I used cleanser to supply silica because 
              it also provided some sodium oxide. The silica is used as the &#8220;scrubber&#8221; 
              and the soap provides the sodium oxide. Toothpaste also contains 
              silica, which is listed on the label as &#8220;hydrated silica.&#8221; 
              Silica is also available as diatomaceous earth, which is sold in 
              garden stores as an insecticide. It is a rock, mined in coastal 
              California, composed of the shells of dead microscopic organisms, 
              called diatoms. When the one celled creatures die, their sharp silica 
              shells remain. These sharp shells are useful as an insecticide because 
              they scratch the exoskeleton of insects causing them to get infections 
              and die. It is also used in abrasives, cement, roofing, paint and 
              plastics.</p>
            <p>Portland cement is a source of silica but also contains alumina 
              and calcium oxides. It can be used in glazes but the difficulty 
              is that it has a very short shelf life because it hardens very quickly. 
              In the same aisle as cement are the cement stains or colorants. 
              These are a great source of iron, manganese and other coloring oxides 
              that we use in ceramics. Actually my favorite source of iron is 
              a cement pigment made by Bayer, called synthetic red and yellow 
              iron oxide. Synthetic iron is the strongest form of iron oxide available, 
              because of its purity and extremely small particle size. In fact, 
              I use it in many of my standard iron glazes. </p>

            <p>Calcium carbonate has been used for centuries by humans for a variety 
              of processes and products. Our ancestors used plant and wood ash 
              as a source of calcium carbonate as well as sea shells and limestone. 
              Today, one of the most well known uses of calcium carbonate is in 
              antacids. Rolaids and other generic antacids are primarily calcium 
              carbonate but some also contain magnesium carbonate. Calcium carbonate 
              and magnesium carbonate together form dolomite. Calcium carbonate 
              is also sold in hardware stores as window cleaner and as the powder 
              used to make lines on football fields. </p>
            <p>A short walk down the aisle of any drug store will provide a multitude 
              of other possibilities for glaze materials. For example, Alka-seltzer 
              is an excellent source of sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as 
              baking soda. In addition to sodium bicarbonate, Alka-seltzer &quot;Gold&quot; 
              contains potassium bicarbonate or what is commonly referred to as 
              &quot;pearl ash&quot;. Sodium bicarbonate is also used in manufacturing 
              textiles and glass, neutralizing acids, purifying air, treating 
              paper and in the production of fire extinguishers.</p>
            <p>Magnesium carbonate is readily available from several products, 
              the tastiest of which is Milk of Magnesia. Baby powder is another 
              excellent source of magnesium oxide in the form of talc, which means 
              that you also get silica and a wonderful fragrance. Baby powder 
              is treated to resist water, so it is somewhat difficult to mix into 
              a glaze batch. I used a bit of liquid soap to break the surface 
              tension, thus allowing the powder to become wet. (Be sure to check 
              the ingredient list of the &#8220;Baby Powder&#8221; as some now 
              contain corn starch instead of talc.) </p>

                  <p>Historically, magnesium oxide was used as &quot;flash&quot; 
                    powder by early photographers and is still used for special 
                    effects at rock concerts. Magnesium carbonate, along with 
                    calcium carbonate, acts as a buffer in aspirin to reduce stomach 
                    upset. Magnesium, in the sulfate form, is also present in 
                    &quot;Epsom salts&quot; which potters commonly use for flocculation 
                    in glaze buckets.</p>
                  <p>Zinc oxide is available in the drug store in the form of 
                    antiseptic ointment or powder called &quot;Gold Bond&quot; 
                    and as a white nose cream to prevent sunburn. In industry, 
                    it is mainly used as a protective coating for galvanizing 
                    metals, but is also used as a paint pigment, in storage batteries, 
                    as a filler in tires, in television tubes and fluorescent 
                    coatings. Zinc oxide is also used in make-up, and for the 
                    treatment of acne, poison ivy (in calamine lotion), and eczema.

                  <p>I found Neutrogena sunscreen for sensitive skin to be a great 
                    source of titanium dioxide. Regular sunscreen resists sun 
                    chemically but this product reflects sun by putting a thin 
                    layer of white titanium dioxide particles on the skin. Titanium 
                    dioxide is used in the ink to print the label on each M &amp; 
                    M candy. It is also used extensively in paint and liquid paper 
                    as a whitener. In 1940, titanium dioxide replaced &quot;white 
                    lead&quot; as a whitening agent in paint. Because of its lightweight 
                    property as a metal, it is used in the construction of aircraft, 
                    bike frames and eyeglass frames. It is used in joint implants 
                    and for rods and pins in orthopedic work because bone will 
                    grow and attach to it.</p>
                  <p>One difficulty I encountered was finding non-iron colorants. 
                    Although make-up was a great source for both kaolin and colorants, 
                    it turned out to be prohibitively expensive. A variety of 
                    colorants can be found in concentrated form as grout and cement 
                    stains. Generally, these colorants are iron-based blacks, 
                    grays and reds, but you can occasionally find blues and some 
                    other non-iron colors.</p>

            <p>As I tested the materials, I found that the iron impurities in 
              pumice stone and rottenstone were sufficient to produce a nice range 
              of colors including light blue, green, yellow, caramel and browns 
              from light to a rich dark brown. Iron has a great range of color 
              response in glazes depending on firing atmosphere and other oxides 
              present. For example, calcium has a bleaching effect on iron, and 
              thus can turn an olive green celadon to a light green, and with 
              sufficient reduction and some added silica, will produce a very 
              nice blue celadon. I added Crest extra-whitening toothpaste to my 
              green celadon and, in heavy reduction, got a nice light blue celadon 
              (see glaze #11). In the presence of magnesium and calcium, small 
              amounts of iron will produce a nice iron yellow. (See glaze #2, 
              which is very similar to the $20,000 Heino Iron Yellow).</p>

            <p>This experiment in glazing has provided me with both a beautiful 
              glaze palate produced solely from locally available products and 
              an expanded understanding of the uses of ceramic materials in everyday 
              life. The following glaze recipes were achieved solely by a conducting 
              multiple series of line blend tests. Several books that have helped 
              me in this investigation include, Mimi Obstler's &quot;Out of the 
              Earth, Into the Fire,&quot; and David Richerson's &quot;The Magic 
              of Ceramics.&quot;</p>
