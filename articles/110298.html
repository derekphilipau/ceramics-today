<H3>Focus on France </H3>

<P> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/i_gills.gif" alt="I" border=0>magineCeramique 
  is a multilingual site that focuses on French ceramic art and French pottery. 
  The <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/indexgb.html"><B>English language homepage</B></A> 
  opens up with a list of French ceramic artists, alongside options to access 
  ceramics by various <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/cerammuse/index.html"><B>French 
  Museums</B></A>, <a href="http://www.ceramique.com/ceramsupply/indexgb.html"><b>Ceramics 
  Suppliers</b></a> and <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/ceramassoc/index.html"><B>French 
  and international Associations and Potter's Markets</B></A>. 
<P> French ceramics have their own particular style, which is often characterized 
  by a looseness in execution of the work and an organic look. This is a strong 
  contrast to let's say German ceramics, which are often characterized by exactness 
  and geometric forms and decoration. The work of <a href="http://www.ceramique.com/Steen-Kepp/index.html"><b>Steen 
  Kepp</b></a>, for example, nearly belies the material he works with.
<P>
Ceramic artist <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/Bruno.Jacquart/index.html"><B>Bruno Jacquart</B></A> has been working with clay for 14 years. He works with raku, achieving subtle effects as well as strong contrasts with metallic flashing achieved in the raku process. <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/Culas-Bonnin/index.html"><B>Odile Culas-Bonnin</B></A> works with stoneware clay fired to lower temperatures. These piecees are then salted and smoked with rubber. Odile previously worked on the potter's wheel, but has since migrated to using molds and slabs. She is particularly interested in natural cracks and fissures and man-made traces left behind in the earth such as by ploughs.
<P> The work of <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/Sybesma-Miep/index.html"><B>Anne-Marie 
  Sybesma de Buy</B></A> utilises an effect that most ceramic artists are trying 
  to avoid -- thermal shock. By taking advantage of differences in thermal expansion 
  between clay and glaze, Anne-Marie achieves a multitude of cracks in her glazes, 
  giving a <A HREF="http://www.ceramique.com/Sybesma-Miep/craquelures.gif"><B>'graph 
  effect'</B></A>, which is then embellished with onbglaze colors to get a raku-like 
  look. These works are mostly hand-built. 
<P> While this is not the only work which can be seen on the ImagineCeramique 
  site, these <a href="http://www.ceramique.com/cerampro/index.html"><b>French 
  Ceramic Artists</b></a> can be seen as typical of the 'French style'.
