<IMG align=left SRC="../images/p_gills.gif" alt="P">amela Irving has been working in ceramics for the past 15 years, and in that time has built up a considerable reputation for herself as a ceramic professional and sculptor.
<P>
Her work explores such themes as 
Mythology, Angels, Royalty, Animal Imagery and other themes and she works with the post-modernist strategy of appropriating other art works, notably Australian and European paintings. Examples of such works are <A HREF="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/irving.htm#vangogh"><B>Van Gogh's Starry Night</B></A> or the medevial painter <A HREF="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/irving.htm#bosch"><B>Hieronymous Bosch</B></A>. Irving has also worked with childrens themes such as <A HREF="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/irving.htm#princess"><B>The Princess and the Pea</B></A> or dealt thematically with such companies as <A HREF="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/irving.htm#fiorucci"><B>Fiorucci</B></A>.

  Pamela Irving has regular solo shows, but believes in diversity and also makes 
  hand-painted functional ware. She has also been successful moving into the area 
  of bronze sculpture. Her first bronze comission was a public sculpture called 
  <A HREF="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/irving3.gif"><B>Larry LaTrobe</B></A>, 
  that &quot;evolved from a series of perfect pets, for people with not enough 
  time to nurture a real one...&quot; That sculpture mysteriously dissappeared, 
  never to be found, after having been extracted from its anchors in the ground. 
  Due to popular demand and the donation of a benefactor, Irving was able to recast 
  the work, which now stands at its rightful place at the Melbourne City square. 
<P> A recent successful retrospective of Irvings work was held at the Lyall Burton 
  Gallery, celebrating &quot;ten years of ceramic image making&quot;. Pamela can 
  be contacted by email via <A HREF="mailto:blindner@bigpond.net.au"><b>blindner@bigpond.net.au.</b></A>
