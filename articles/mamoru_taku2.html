              One of the characteristics of Bizen-ware is that there are no paintings 
              or intentional glazes on the ceramics. Instead of these man-made 
              finishes, Bizen-ware has patterns drawn by the force of the fire. 
              Based upon the patterns (or 'landscapes' in pottery terminology,) 
              they are categorised into the following; 'Sangiri (oxidised),''Hidasuki 
              (fire patterned),' 'Botamochi (rice-cake patterned)' and 'Goma (ash 
              covered).' <BR>

              <br>
              Taku-san also applies his principle, of having the 'Right-thing-in-the-right-place,' 
              to create the landscapes. He stated that it's not just fire that 
              makes landscapes, but also factors such as clay and shaping. An 
              holistic balance throughout the creative process produces more harmonised 
              works. <br>
              <BR>
              Even as early on as selecting the clay, Taku-san has the design 
              of landscapes in his mind already. Based upon the design, he uses 
              the most suitable shaping techniques and firing environment. <Br>
              <BR>
              "Rather than making arbitrary finishes caused by unbalanced forces, 
              I try to control 98% of the colour, landscape and shape results. 
              I leave 2% to nature's hands." <br>
              <BR>
              Taku-san explained to me as I was looking at a 'Kigoma (Yellowish 
              Ash-covered)' Tokkuri (Sake Vessel), which had a small bluish glaze.	
              <Br>
              <BR>
              "That glaze is developed with melted ash that dropped from the kiln 
              ceiling. I expected it would happen, though I did not want it to. 
              I can still enjoy this natural creation. If the unexpected creation 
              goes beyond two percent, then I would consider the work to be a 
              failure and you would not see it on the shelf." <Br>
              <BR>
              The 'Goma' Sake Vessel has a yellowish ash-covering layer shimmering 
              on the surface of a dark brown base clay colour. It has multiple 
              flavours like toffee. The flavour from the top layer has melted 
              into the core layer of work. <br>
              <br>
              <a name="imbete"></a> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/KigomaTokkuri.jpg" width="100" height="136" alt="Imbete KigomaTokkuri" border="0" align="left"> 
              "I applied a technique called 'Imbete' to that particular piece. 
              Imbete is a method where a layer of clay is placed on top of pre-fired 
              potteries. I started seriously working with this method over ten 
              years ago. It gives me a very different perspective." <Br>
              <BR>
              From the conversation with Taku-san, I envisioned that the Imbete 
              technique was a little similar to the process of making the German 
              cake 'Baum Kuchen' where one layer at a time is baked, before the 
              next is poured on. <BR>
              Although there are critics who claim 'Imbete' is an ugly patchwork 
              technique, Taku-san's years of research and achievement bring out 
              an artistic harmony from the core and covering layers of these pieces.

              "I entered the pottery world in my mid twenties. My background was 
              in machine design, not in pottery." <Br>
              <BR>
              Taku-san visited a Bizen potter by chance. The potter let Taku-san 
              wheel a work and he enjoyed the experience a greatly. <BR>
              <br>
              "At that time, I thought 'Wow. There is a profession like this.' 
              Gradually, the 'wow' become a reality in me and a year after my 
              first wheeling experience, I was at the entrance to the Bizen pottery 
              world." <BR>
              <br>
              "Compared to those who started pottery as a family profession, I 
              had many disadvantages in my knowledge and experience. I filled 
              these gaps by making countless trials and spending hours conducting 
              research. The advantage I did have was some useful experience from 
              my previous profession. The logical perspective from my training 
              helped me understand the features of ceramics from a different approach, 
              such as classifying the character of clay from the geographical 
              condition of the site." <BR>

              Taku-san has been keeping records of his production data such as 
              different clay blends and firing environments. <br>
              <BR>
              "They are simply revisionary records to confirm whether what has 
              been done was appropriate or not. The Important point is how YOU 
              diagnose what to apply, not the data itself." <Br>
              <BR>
              Those records are just tiny bits of what Taku-san has built up around 
              him. There are no short cuts here, just years experience and drawers

              There are two categories of works in Taku-san's collection, the 
              introductory works and the classic works. Taku-san expresses his 
              debt to the old Bizen masterpieces in his classic collections, which 
              include various items for tea ceremonies, such as water jars and 
              tea bowls. <br>
              <BR>
              "Tea ceremony ceramics are one of the most challenging categories 
              for me. As Bizen-ware is elevated to this level of sophistication 
              by tea masters. You would find extreme dignity in old tea wares, 
              especially those made in Momoyama period, in the 16th century. <BR clear=all>
              <br>
              Before this time Bizen-ware was produced only for everyday utensils. 
              The Momoyama period is culturally significant in Japan's history 
              for the development of highly sophisticated aestheticism such as 
              'Wabi Sabi' in the way of tea. Sen Rikyu, the great tea master found 
              an earthy beauty in Bizen-ware and started using these ceramics 
              for tea ceremonies. Since then, Bizen potters have been asked to 
              make organic yet sophisticated potteries to meet the tough requirements 
              from tea masters." <br>
              <BR>
              "I wondered how these items were used in tea ceremonies and started 
              lessons with a tea master. You need to follow a strict code of manners 
              during a tea ceremony, such as placing the tea bowl in the correct 
              position after making tea. They all make sense if you come to know 
              the original meaning which is rooted in natural movement. For instance, 
              the placement of the tea bowl is set as it is, simply because it 
              is the most natural way. <br>
              <br>
              Also, tea ceremonies are the form of composite art that expresses 
              hospitality. Tea utensils play an assisting role to serve the guest 
              in the ceremony.<BR>
              <br>
              Bizen-ware is one of the best pottery styles in its natural character 
              to play this role, modestly assisting the hospitality from the tea 
              host. <BR>
              <br>
              In this sense, the influence of the way of tea and Wabi Sabi is 
              indispensable in the growth of Bizen. The spirit, which Sen Rikyu 
              advocated in 'Wabi Sabi', of hospitality, philosophy and aesthetics 
              is the core essence of my pottery as well." <BR>

              to Old Bizen masterpieces</b></span> <BR>
              I heard Taku-san talk of 'old Bizen masterpieces' as his goal and 
              I wondered how exactly they inspired him.<BR>
              <br>
              "Well, these days I describe myself as a potter, but in the early 
              days, I thought of myself as a contemporary Bizen artist." <br>
              <BR>
              "After three years of training, I launched my own studio. I started 
              to express myself in my work. I created all sorts of contemporary 
              Bizen-ware that attempted to go beyond the influence of my master. 
              It was exciting at the beginning and my clients found my works interesting. 
              However, I soon found myself getting bored. I could not keep up 
              my enthusiasm and I felt myself to be in a deadlock."<BR>
              <br>
              "I started to look for a genuine axis that could keep me inspired. 
              The old Bizen masterpieces held the answer. The authentic beauty 
              never changed over centuries of time. This lasting magnetism certainly 
              keeps attracting people including me beyond history. This is how 
              I started to climb the mountain of old Bizen masterpieces." <BR>
              <br>
              "As my steps went forward, I realized that if I only followed the 
              masterpieces, I would be lost in the massive power of them. So, 
              I fixed my aim to bring the essence of authentic dignity in these 
              masterpieces into my own work." <BR>
              <br>
              "The mountain is extremely genuine and enormously profound. I am 
              fortunate enough to be on it. I have not had a second to get bored 
              ever since."<BR>
              <!--br>"Would I wish to make contemporary art pieces again?" "No." he replied abruptly, then letting a playful smile dance across his face Taku-san said, <BR>
                  					<br>"I might. I might if I want to parody my work."<BR>
                  					<br>"Well, but now, I have no need in amusing myself. I am busy with my work.<BR-->
              <br>
              "Time is indeed too short to achieve all I would like to in my lifetime. 
              <br>
              I understand now why potters are trained in an apprenticeship system."

              <br>
              In the studio, Taku-san was showing precise solutions to the questions 
              his son, Shusaku raised. Overhearing their technical discussions, 
              I felt that they share a lot beyond the master and the disciple 
              relationship. It was more like a collaboration. <br>
              <BR>
              "It has been three years since my son started working with me. I 
              did not have him directly into my studio. If I had done, he would 
              be influenced by my current work before developing his own ideas 
              and creations. So, he went to a school specializing in porcelain 
              outside Bizen." <br>
              <BR>
              "As he started to work with me, I made it clear to him to utilise 
              my path as a stepping stone to make his own step forward. As long 
              as he understands my themes and perspectives and shares them with 
              me, then I can give him as many tips as he needs. He can acquire 
              highly condensed experience, efficiently from the trials I have 
              made over the last twenty years. While he works with me, he shall 
              follow my way and ultimately go beyond me. <br>
              <BR>
              However, I would not force him to follow me if he does not wish 
              to. " <br>
              <BR>
              Shusaku seems to be proud of his master and father. I could see 
              his respect for the clay is as high as his master's from the way 
              he works with it. I am not the only one to notice this, as Shusaku 
              has received a series of best prizes for his works. <br>
              <BR>
              <STRONG>"The mission of potters could be similar to farmers. Potters 
              deliver the best harvest as a result of proper cultivation. They 
              then pass on the nutritious soil to the next generation."</STRONG> 
              <br>
              <BR>
              "Having Shusaku as my partner encourages me to challenge myself 
              further. I can share all my experience with him, and do not have 
              to worry about failure. Even if I am not able to, Shusaku can turn 
              my failures into something fruitful."</p>
