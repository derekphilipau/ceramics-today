                    Pottery in Suleija is 54 years old this year. It has not been 
                    a working pottery as long as that, it is true; but it was 
                    in August 1951 that the English studio potter, Michael Cardew, 
                    recruited by the Nigerian colonial Government in 1950 as pottery 
                    Officer, moved up from Lagos to the small town then called 
                    Abuja and started, with a small team of local workmen to build 
                    the new Pottery Training Centre. Ladi Kwali was not to join 
                    the trainees there until the end of 1954, but Cardew had already 
                    been excited by her beautiful pots in the village of Kwali 
                    and hoped to persuade her to come and work with him. Looked 
                    at from the vantage point of 2001, for the colonial government 
                    to start busying itself about the &#8220;improvement&#8221; of the pottery 
                    techniques of Nigeria it was odd thing to happen, considering 
                    that Nigerian pots, made according to the traditional method 
                    practiced for centuries, were are magnificent already. The 
                    decision to do this, however, resulted in the potters who 
                    made then. Michael Cardew was one of the best publicist ever 
                    for West Africa`s traditional potters even as he worked to 
                    create a new network of rural Potteries using techniques foreign 
                    to the region.</p></td>

                  <p align="justify">He went to Nigeria when he was 49, not because 
                    he had an urge to change Nigerian pottery but because he desperately 
                    wanted to get back to west Africa where he had unfinished 
                    business after 5 years spent in Ghana ( then Gold Coast ) 
                    1943-1948. He was deeply attached to a young potter there, 
                    Clement Kofi Athey, who was running the pottery at Vume they 
                    had set up together, but had had to return to England after 
                    re-current ill-health and he felt he owed it to Kofi not to 
                    allow that project to fail. From Nigeria he thought he could 
                    keep in touch, and visit during his leave, for the sake of 
                    his obsession with Africa he left behind him once again his 
                    pottery at Wenford bridge in Cornwall ( rented out), his wife 
                    (teaching in London), three young sons ( still at school) 
                    and his reputation as an outstanding studio potter ( known 
                    to few, even among the British, in Nigeria ). Of course, Nigeria 
                    took him over and altered his motive. <br>
                    He did a preliminary tour of the Western region, and quickly 
                    reported to the department of commerce and industries that 
                    some of their ideas needed modification, he could hardly do 
                    himself out a job by rejecting them altogether, given his 
                    desire to be in West Africa and work with West African Potters.

              <tr> 
                <td valign=top width="100%"> <p align="justify">In fact the job 
                    description he had been given was not about changing traditional 
                    pottery but about setting up a sort of inter mediate technology 
                    project, a rural industry using the wheel, glazes and high-firing 
                    in the European studio pottery tradition. It was evidently 
                    prompted by the perceived need for a home-grown industry to 
                    supply the middle-class Nigerian demand for a glazed tableware 
                    suitable for European-style meals and hot drinks, at that 
                    time already supplied by factory-produced imports.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Cardew`s first report of July 1950 states 
                    that a wholesale transformation of the Nigerian native pottery 
                    industry is considered to be neither practicable or desirable`, 
                    although he said this idea had been widely entertained by 
                    non-technical observers. This native industry had &#8216;technical 
                    advantages peculiar to it, which the others do not possess&#8217;, 
                    was &#8216;distinguished by simplicity and nobility in shape and 
                    decoration&#8217;, remarkably cheap to produce, and &#8216;in a healthy 
                    state and not likely to suffer from the competition of locally-produced 
                    glazed wares.&#8217; He pointed out that glazing and high-firing 
                    to make the proposed table ware non-porous &#8216; would largely 
                    lose one of the great virtues of the native pottery - tolerance 
                    of the thermal shock.&#8217; He felt able to support the argument 
                    for a home industry to run parallel to the local village pottery, 
                    producing pots for a modern middle- class westernized life 
                    style. he proposed small &#8216;experimental stations&#8217; with small 
                    numbers of trainees, rather than a central school of ceramics.</p>
                  <p align="justify">This report resulted in his promotion to 
                    senior pottery Officer, and for the next two years he was 
                    involve in the setting up of pottery at Okigwe and Ado-Ekiti 
                    with other British pottery Officers, V A Gregory and S Atkins. 
                    But the decision about where to put the northern region pottery 
                    training Centrex turned out to be the crucial one for Cardew, 
                    and for a number of Nigerians whose lives were changed by 
                    it.</p>
                  <p align="justify">The notes, illustrated by sketches, for his 
                    second report in early 1951, following a tour of Nigeria`s 
                    Northern Region in November and December 1950, show his excitement 
                    as he discovered its varied pottery; he especially admired 
                    the pots made by women in the Abuja area. He was able, as 
                    a colonial Officer, to call upon an impressive network of 
                    existing knowledge to help him. Local potters, district heads, 
                    administrators, miners, Geologists Educationists Missionaries 
                    - all sorts of people knew about the soil structure, the transport 
                    systems, the fuel, the traditions and other factors he had 
                    to consider in deciding how to proceed, and in particular, 
                    where to site the Pottery Training Center. He was allowed 
                    to use the Furnaces of the Amalgamated Tin mines of Jos to 
                    test clay samples. It was a unique support system for a researcher 
                    into traditional pottery as well as prospective local potter.</p>
                  <p align="justify">&#8216;We decided ABUJA after all!&#8217; he wrote in 
                    his note after a meeting in Kastina with Stanhope (Sam) White 
                    of the department of Commerce and Industries, Kaduna, in April 
                    1951. &#8216;Good and central for N.Nigeria, Wonderful local pots, 
                    a nice town where trainees can live, Hausas would not be out 
                    of place there, and above all, a 1st rate Emir &#8211; yes, hurray 
                    !!!&#8217; The &#8216;after all&#8217; meant &#8216;in spite of Abuja&#8217;s not being 
                    on the railway&#8217;, but as it was to be a training center and 
                    not a commercial production Center, this was decided not to 
                    be crucial. Abuja was the place for &#8216;inspiration&#8217;, he said, 
                    and that would made for good pots.</p>
                  <p align="justify">From late August 1951 he supervised the building 
                    of the pottery at Abuja, locally thatched buildings; (the 
                    present ones were built in 1973 ) and started selecting trainees. 
                    Who were these to be? An aspect of the European-style pottery 
                    which contrasted with African pottery was the fact that the 
                    trainees were expected to be men, where as most of Nigerian 
                    potters were women. Hausa land was the big exception, although 
                    within northern Nigerian there were also non-Hausa communities 
                    with women potters. The Abuja emirate was Hausa, that its 
                    population was overwhelmingly Gwari and included outstanding 
                    Gwari women potters. Cardew, in his 1950 report, said he envisaged 
                    the new techniques being mainly to men with only a &#8216;Small 
                    fringe&#8217; of women potters.</p>
                  <p align="justify">This could be for a numbers of reasons, some 
                    referred to elsewhere in Cardew&#8217;s writings such as the fact 
                    that in the traditional industries, potting was,in parts, 
                    the whole way of life, not something as a western industrialized 
                    society and regarded as a career. Men would found it easier 
                    to train and join a paid work- force, because they were less 
                    encumbered by family commitments. This view may be regarded 
                    as reflecting British prejudices and practices and distorting 
                    African Society structure, as happened in the case of Agricultural 
                    and other training. Or you could see it as a realistic appraisal, 
                    since Cardew had already suggested that the traditional, mainly 
                    women, potters would not adversely affected by a new small-scale 
                    industry and African societies, like British once at the time 
                    also tended to separate men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s work. He had himself 
                    always worked with other men in both England and the Gold 
                    Coast, except when apprenticed with Bernard Leach, and would 
                    probably be inclined to prefer this. </p>
                  <p align="justify">As it later turned out, the Abuja Pottery 
                    Training Centre`s star potter ( Cardew would have hated the 
                    description of any potter as a star, but that was exactly 
                    what she became on overseas tour ) was a woman, Ladi Kwali, 
                    whose basic skill and genius, he always freely acknowledged, 
                    were fully developed before she joined him. But there were 
                    always more men than women working with Cardew. It is odd 
                    in a way that he went along with the argument for a separate 
                    work force outside the old social structures, given that he 
                    always professed a desire to eliminate the distinction between 
                    one&#8217;s working life and everything else, and to achieve an 
                    undivided life as had been done in pre-industrial England. 
                    But he had to work within a framework of an administration 
                    struggling to show that it was modernizing the northern region 
                    of Nigeria. I suspect that this masculine bias involve all 
                    sorts of different reasons.</p></td>

                <td valign=top width="100%"> <p align="justify">So the earliest 
                    trainees were Hausa men, Audu and Gwadabe from Kano, Closely 
                    followed by men from other regions with an increasing number 
                    of local potters. Among the first to start were Okoro Ike

                    Audu Mugu and Sidi came down from Sokoto. Later came Bako

                    Inuwa, Hassan Lapai and Usman Zukoko in 1957, Ibrahim Muhtari

                    Yawa and Abu Karo in 1958 . Kofi Athey, though continuing 
                    to run the Vume pottery in Ghana, worked at Abuja for several 
                    stints of a few months before coming to Nigeria to run the 
                    new Jos pottery in 1963. The kiln gang, who remained throughout 
                    Cardew`s time and later, were Danjuma Kilin, Husseine, Gwari 
                    and Na`anabi. 
                  <p align="justify">However quite early on, Cardew`s preference 
                    for male trainees was overridden by his respect for superb 
                    skill and his wish to work with people endowed within. In 
                    the Abuja area, these were women. He had wanted to bring Ladi 
                    Kwali into the training Centrex from the beginning, and finally, 
                    after negotiations with her and with the local authorities, 
                    she arrived in December 1954.She learned to throw ordinary 
                    tableware and smaller pots for practical use, but she also 
                    continued to hand-build pots, which were then controversially 
                    glazed and high-fired. Cardew was well aware of the drawbacks 
                    of this procedure in terms of weight and utility. They were 
                    much less breakable than traditional pots though, and they 
                    became Collector`s treasures, now worth huge sums at auction 
                    which neither Cardew nor Ladi herself could ever have envisaged. 
                  </p>
                  <p align="justify">Cardew`s international reputation played 
                    a key role in putting Abuja potters on the international ceramic 
                    world map. He had previously exhibited at the Berkeley Gallery 
                    in London, and was able to arrange for Abuja exhibitions there 
                    in 1958 and 1959, which increased his own fame and made Ladi 
                    Kwali in particular a name in the pottery world. Her success 
                    opened the door to other women potters: Halima Audu from Ido, 
                    came in 1959, and made some superb pots (in Britain, her work 
                    can be seen in the Milner-White collection at York City Art 
                    Gallery.) She died tragically young only two years later. 
                    Asibe Ido and Lami Toto arrived in 1963, followed by Kande 
                    Ushafa. At the time of Cardew`s departure in 1965, the four 
                    surviving women along with six men - Tanko Ashada, Gugong 
                    Bond, Peter Gboko, Abu Karol, Ibrahim Muhtari and Bawa Ushafa, 
                    plus Danjuma Landam, Assistant pottery Officer, were still 
                    at the Abuja Pottery training center. The Kano and Sokoto 
                    Potters had gone back to their home towns, and Okoro had gone 
                    to modern ceramics in Umuahia. </p></td>

              in the traditional way</font> 
            <p align="justify">Some of these potters and no doubt others who never 
              left there villages, were also outstanding, but Ladi Kwali remained 
              grande dame of the Abuja pottery. In 1962 she spent three weeks 
              in England demonstrating Gwari pot &#8211; building techniques, attending 
              another Berkeley Gallery Exhibition of Abuja Pottery and received 
              the MBE. Coming back to Abuja she was so full of her experiences 
              that other staffs sardonically nicknamed her &#8216;Radio London&#8217;, ( as 
              Michael O&#8217;Brien, who came to Abuja soon afterwards and later took 
              over from Cardew, recalls). later she was awarded an honorary Doctorate 
              of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria , an unprecedented academic distinction 
              for a woman potter without formal education. 
            <p align="justify">She would certainly not have granted this if she 
              had not been &#8216;discovered&#8217; by Cardew and then the world outside Nigeria. 
              Michael Cardew stayed at Abuja until 1965, normally spending ten 
              months there and two on leave at Wenford Bridge in every year, but 
              also going back to Ghana occasionally to help Kofi at Vume. Abuja 
              turned out to be just as pleasant a place in which to run a pottery 
              training center as he had envisaged in his diary notes of 1951, 
              and the Emir,the famous Suleiman Barau,was even better than &#8216;1st 
              rate&#8217;,being a friend, supporter and advisor in everything. But it 
              was not an easy life. Cardew`s early Nigerian years involved him 
              in relentless physical slog, following in the footsteps of the great 
              geologist Falconer on camping treks of several days at a time in 
              his search for kaolin, feldspar, limestone and other raw materials 
              for pottery and glazes. He was already in his fifties - much older 
              than the Nigerians who accompanied him -and continued to suffer 
              regular bouts of ill-health, including bilharzia and from the results 
              of some dramatic car accidents.</p>
            <p align="justify">Cardew was unique in his relationship with Nigerian 
              potters, But he was also part of a group of British people in the 
              1950s who tried, in the run-up to independence, to make sure that 
              Nigerian art and history were appreciated and preserved for the 
              people of Nigeria. these included Bernard Fagg, who excavated the 
              Nok culture, started the Jos museum and instigated instigated the 
              magnificent collection of pots there;Sylvia Leith-Ross, who collected 
              the pots for jos at the already distinguished career in education, 
              the historian Michael Crowder, who succeeded E.H.Duckworth as editor 
              of Nigeria Magazine and Kenneth Murray, first Survey of Antiquities. 
              He wrote the introduction &#8216;pottery techniques in Nigeria&#8217; for Sylvia 
              Leith-Ross&#8217;s Nigerian pottery ( Ibadan,1970) and articles on traditional 
              pottery for Nigeria Magazine as well as his book pioneer pottery 
              for studio potters starting up in similar conditions.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Abuja Pottery Training Centre never fulfilled 
              the early aim of spreading a network of small potteries, run by 
              potters trained there, to supply new Nigerian needs.By the late 
              fifties it has become a show piece celebrated in Nigeria and abroad, 
              and sold mainly to expatriates and members of Nigerian elites. the 
              best pots were put aside for London or other European exhibitions. 
              Peter Dick, a british potter who worked at Abuja in 1961-2, remembers 
              the staff saying &#8216;Sai London! Sai paris!&#8217; when an exceptionally 
              good pot emerged from the kiln.</p>
            <p align="justify">Potteries started by Abuja- trained potters under 
              Cardew&#8217;s guidance in Sokoto and Kano failed within a few years, 
              largely, Cardew said in later discussions with O&#8217;Brien, because 
              as government employees the workers never worked hard enough or 
              use enough initiative to make them succeed. The later Jos pottery, 
              founded with help from Bernard Fagg and money from an American &#8216;fairy 
              good mother`, did continue under Kofi Athey.</p>
            <p align="justify">How did the training centre continue to obtain 
              government finance well into the era of independence Nigeria? It 
              was never commercial until after cardew&#8217;s departure ( under Michael 
              O&#8217;Brien}and its original purpose of created a network of rural industries 
              to supply to supply Nigerians with a tableware made locally from 
              local materials had not been fulfilled. Was Cardew just lucky to 
              find modest but secure patronage for a marvelous experiment in Anglo-Nigerian 
              cross-cultural ceramics,because of the particular circumstances 
              of northern Nigerian? Certainly the publicity Abuja brought to Nigeria 
              at a crucial time in its history was favorably viewed by both the 
              late colonial and new Nigerian governments.</p>
            <p align="justify">Michael Cardew, having left Nigeria rather reluctantly 
              ( though well past civil service retirement age at 64 ),did not 
              cease to be involved with his old friends. Ladi Kwali went on another 
              triumphant tour demonstrating her work, this time to the United 
              states in 1972 with Cardew and Kofi athey assisting and explaining 
              where necessary. She has continued working at the pottery, and one 
              the most delightful scenes in the BBC television film of 1974 Mud 
              and Water man shows her greeting Cardew on her return visit to his 
              old place at Abuja with its new buildings. He continued his active 
              and international life until his sudden death in Cornwall in 1983. 
              Ladi Kwali died at almost the same time but at a much younger age 
              in Minna. Kofi Athey, after leaving Jos at about 1990, worked in 
              the early nineties at Margaret Mama&#8217;s Jacaranda pottery, also near 
              Kaduna, with some other Abuja staff trained by Cardew, and is believed 
              to died in Ghana in the 1990&#8217;s. The Emir of Abuja, who was so vital 
              a part of this ( as of other developments in his emirate), has also 
              died. So what is left ?</p>
            <p align="justify">There has been small but significant continuing 
              results from this unusual episode in late colonial history, and 
              this obsession of an English potter. There was of course the impact 
              of Ghana and Nigeria on Cardew&#8217;s own work, for the pots of his west 
              African period are generally agreed to have been among his best. 
              But also he gave a unique training to his small group of trainee 
              potters and stimulated appreciation, both in Nigeria and elsewhere, 
              of traditional pots and potters.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Ladi Kwali pottery at Abuja is still government&#8211;owned 
              and employing staff, but reports suggest it is not producing much 
              pottery. I have not yet been able to visit it to see for myself.</p>
            <p align="justify">Perhaps the Anglo-Nigeria studio pottery movement 
              started by Cardew is being upheld more effectively elsewhere in 
              the country. Michael O&#8217;Brien, Cardew&#8217;s colleague and immediate successor, 
              continues to spent much of his time unobtrusively helping Nigerian 
              potters. One such is Danlam Aliyu of Al Habib pottery, Minna, who 
              was trained by O&#8217;Brien at Abuja and then by Cardew at Wenford Bridge, 
              his pottery in Cornwall. Danlami has written in Pottery Quarterly 
              about his work and the fact that his work is different from that 
              of local women but in no way supplants it. His brother Umaru also 
              runs a successful small pottery, the Maraba near Kaduna. Others, 
              though not directly connected to Cardew, have found inspiration 
              in his work for similar subjects in other parts of Nigeria. Cardew&#8217;s 
              forecast that traditional pottery would not be threatened by this 
              studio pottery has been proved correctly. The threat comes from 
              much bigger forces. Cardew&#8217;s was a &#8216;small is beautiful&#8217; enterprise, 
              embodying his care for, and enjoyment of, the people and their environment.</p>
            <p align="justify">This article arises from research for a project 
              biography of Michael Cardew&#8217;s work in west Africa from 1942 to 1965. 
              I would like to thank Michael O&#8217; Brien, Cardew&#8217;s successor at Abuja, 
              and Michael Cardew&#8217;s eldest son, Seth Cardew, of Wenford Bridge 
              Pottery in Cornwall, for their great help with this project, as 
              well as Cardew&#8217;s friends and colleagues who have contributed their 
              recollections. </p>
