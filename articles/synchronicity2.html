              Making a Film Documentary on African Ceramics<br>
              by Ron du Bois, Professor Emeritus of Art, Oklahoma State University 
              <br>
              <br>
              In 2002, fifteen years later, I was able to complete three film/video 
              documentaries on the women potters in the city of Ilorin, Kwara 
              State, Nigeria. One, entitled Yoruba Potters: Mothers and Daughters 
              &#8211; Dada Compound, documents the construction of ekoko amu, 
              huge water-storage vessels essential to daily life, especially in 
              rural areas where there is no plumbing. The video now exists in 
              two versions:
            <ol>
              <li> The initial 30-minute version, which I financed myself. It 
                was the basis for additional funding by the Ford Foundation and 
                was awarded an Honorable Mention at the film festival, &quot;A 
                Century of Ceramics on Film and Video,&quot; Amsterdam, 1999.</li>
              <li> An expanded and improved 38-minute version, financed by Fulbright 
                and the Ford Foundation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> A third program, Yoruba Potters: Mothers and Daughters &#8211; 
              Ogbena Compound, approximately 35 minutes, documents the production 
              of lidded soup bowls, called isasun, used in rural areas for cooking 
              over an open fire.
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#10"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/10.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#13"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/13.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a>
<p> The problems of finalizing the Ogbena program were considerable, 
              and stem from my failure to bring home a really good slide of the 
              object itself, i.e., an earthenware lidded soup bowl. That oversight 
              was to cost at least a year of delay, additional worry, and inconvenience 
              for museum personnel here and abroad trying to help with the project. 
              I was unable to obtain good close up photos or to locate a Yoruba 
              lidded soup bowl in any museum collection. As of May 12, 2002, Dr. 
              Afolabi attempted four times to bring one or two isasun to the U.S. 
              Unfortunately, all attempts failed. (As of May 12, 2002, no isasun 
              had been successfully delivered to me in Stillwater. Another attempt 
              is now in progress. )</p>
            <p> Both the ekoko amu and the isasun are produced with hand-building 
              skills alone. The entire processes for both are documented in these 
              videos. The Dada Compound video demonstrates and explains the construction 
              of huge ekoko amu, from digging and working the clay to the dramatic 
              &quot;open field&quot; firing of more than a thousand perfectly 
              symmetrical water vessels made without a potter's wheel. The women 
              and girls, ages 5 to 65, work at their profession from dawn to dusk, 
              year-round. Because of rapidly changing conditions in Nigeria &#8211; 
              the infatuation with modern technology and plastics &#8211; these 
              skills could pass away, victims of Western technology and notions 
              of &quot;progress&quot;.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#20"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/20.jpg" width="154" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#4"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/4.jpg" width="79" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a></p>
            <p>The subject was of intense interest to me, but no funding agency 
              appeared interested in a documentary about black women potters. 
              Over the course of a decade, I wrote applications without success 
              to all agencies suggested by the University Grants Office. Was racism, 
              it occurred to me, a factor in a pattern of disinterest? </p>
            <p>Finally, when all chances of funding had failed, I personally financed 
              the production of Dada Compound. The decision to spend my own funds 
              was based on my own intense interest in the subject and my desire 
              to make it available to a larger audience. By chance this coincided 
              with the interest and availability of a writer friend, Dr. Sandra 
              Williams. She understood the technical aspects of video editing 
              and production, had her doctorate in theatre and was an expert in 
              video-script writing. She could transcribe the written word into 
              the spoken word and she rewrote parts of my field notes into effective 
              narration. Every effort was made to economize, and much of her work 
              was voluntary. As the principal investigator and resident expert, 
              I had already completed a great deal of the conceptual and preparatory 
              work.</p>
            <p> The video production studio was located in Tulsa, a round trip 
              of 145 miles from Stillwater. The actual outlay mounted to over 
              $5,000 for video production costs and honorarium support for Dr. 
              Williams.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#6"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/6.jpg" width="152" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#5"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/5.jpg" width="124" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a></p>
            <p>There are likely to be tensions between video production editors 
              and clients on how to select, sequence, and edit the visual material. 
              The young man who worked on Dada Compound, a non-educator and a 
              non-potter, didn't have the same regard for the material as Dr. 
              Williams and I had. He liked a fast sense of tempo, as in commercials. 
              Quick cuts seemed natural to him, but not to me. The ambient sounds 
              of pottery making and village life were musical to me, but video 
              without narration or background music made him uncomfortable. Nevertheless, 
              the video editor's expertise and technical knowledge are critical. 
              The video editor for the revised production contributed significantly 
              to the expressive and visual effectiveness.</p>
            <p> Editing sessions are expensive. The objective is to have everything 
              organized so that no time is lost and no money wasted. Yet an editing 
              project seems to develop a life of its own and inevitably requires 
              more time and money than anticipated. Picture material can be edited 
              in an infinite number of ways. The &quot;right&quot; way is subjective. 
              The process requires a sense of visual form as well as of storytelling, 
              in my case, hopefully resulting in a product that would appeal to 
              an audience of potters as well as to specialists in African art. 
              I wanted the material to be presented in such a way that Western 
              potters could, if they so desired, recreate the processes and the 
              objects documented. I felt narration should be authentic, based 
              on a common fund of information understood by students and African 
              arts specialists. The final responsibility rested with me &#8211; 
              the only person who had a background in studio ceramics, African 
              art, photography, etc., &#8211; and who had no experience in video 
              editing or scriptwriting.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#7"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/7.jpg" width="81" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#8"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/8.jpg" width="74" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a></p>
            <p> I had gone to Nigeria with the view that the work had to be done 
              by &quot;a single researcher with a camera&quot; who could learn 
              about the culture, the potters and the process, and document them 
              as they were learned. I wanted to use the &quot;indirect method&quot; 
              of the creative process, in which the final result is not known 
              at the outset. It is the only practical method of filming in a situation 
              where there is little, if any, pre-existing knowledge of what is 
              to be documented.</p>
            <p> The &quot;direct method&quot; is one in which the information 
              is already known, so that a script can be written listing the sequence 
              of camera shots. The &quot;direct method&quot; might be more efficient 
              for a professional film crew after the research and observation 
              have been completed. But there is no doubt, especially in a remote 
              area, that the footage a lone cameraman can gather over the course 
              of several months or a year is far more substantial.</p>
            <p> In my situation the services of a professional crew were ruled 
              out by budget. To stay solvent, I had to be my own cameraman. I 
              was pleased when I asked my video editor, &quot;What's the difference 
              in the way I shot this documentary and the way a professional would 
              have shot it?&#8221; His answer was, &quot;None.&quot;</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#9"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/9.jpg" width="161" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#2"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/2.jpg" width="86" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a></p>
            <p> I have never felt comfortable with a beautifully produced film 
              without narration. The absence of informed narration, I feel, reduces 
              the educational value. It avoids the demanding task of writing and 
              matching narration to visual images.</p>
            <p> I sent the initial 30-minute version, along with other application 
              materials, a written proposal, and a budget proposal to the Ford 
              Foundation, Lagos, Nigeria for yet another attempt at funding. The 
              written proposal stressed the importance of documenting the hand-built 
              production of the massive ekoko amu water vessels made at Dada Compound 
              and the much smaller lidded soup bowls, called isasun, at Ogbena 
              Compound. Both are essential to survival in village Nigeria. But 
              it was the video itself that spelled the difference between just 
              another application and a successful application. The video showed 
              clearly the quality and importance of the project. The application 
              stipulated a budget of $75,000. The counter-offer was $50,000 and 
              was accepted. This reduction ruled out compensation for the researcher/producer. 
              I continued working as a volunteer.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#11"><IMG SRC="images/dubois/thumbs/11.jpg" width="146" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a><a href="synchronicity_images_b.htm#12"><img src="images/dubois/thumbs/12.jpg" width="138" height="110" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="1"></a></p>
            <p> In 1986, just after retirement from Oklahoma State University, 
              I was awarded a Fulbright Senior African Regional Research Award, 
              which funded the original research. I was told, along with the other 
              grantees at the Fulbright orientation session in Washington, D.C., 
              that the competition had been intense and that we were all fortunate 
              to have been selected. I had applied as an art professor, potter, 
              photographer, and African art specialist.</p>
            <p> I had introduced and taught the first survey course in African 
              art offered in Oklahoma, called, &quot;The Humanistic Tradition 
              in African Art.&quot; The title and contents of the course were 
              based on notes and materials obtained from Professor Joe Hill, New 
              York University. I owe a debt of gratitude to his systematic and 
              well-organized presentation of stylistic &quot;accents.&quot; His 
              course, grounded in humanistic values, concerns, ambiguities, and 
              questions, served as an important point of reference for understanding 
              the arts of the world and the arts of early societies in particular.</p>
