              Jeroen Bechtold</b></font>
            <P> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/j_gills.gif" alt="J">eroen Bechtold 
              has been a <A HREF="http://www.euronet.nl/users/bbvbbv/2001.html"><B>porcelain</B></A> 
              artist for over two decades and is based in Holland. Early on in 
              his career, he worked in Germany as a designer for Rosenthal. He 
              is now an accomplished ceramist who has exhibited internationally 
              and has his own gallery in central Amsterdam. Jeroen is also well-known 
              for his pioneering work in the field of <A HREF="http://www.euronet.nl/users/bbvbbv/virtc.html"><B>'virtual 
              ceramics'</B></A>. The following interview was conducted during 
              his recent visit to Australia, where he was Artist in Residence 
              at the Canberra School of Art. 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              You have been working extensively in the area of <A HREF="070797.html"><B>'virtual
              ceramics'</B></A>. How do you explain this new emerging field to 
              the uninitiated? 
            <P> <B>JB</B> <BR>
              Virtual Ceramics are exactly the same as any other intelligently 
              applied craft. If you use your craft with brains and feeling, it 
              will be about thoughts, ideas, love and style. Shapes have to do 
              with love -- touching form, shade, light etc. But in virtual ceramics 
              what you are doing is exactly the same -- in short this is craft 
              that is, but need not be. Of course this makes people insecure, 
              but craft is about looking, touching and feeling with your eyes 
              and emotions. I think that it is incredibly important to explore 
              new avenues in craft now. We already live in a world where images 
              are far more important than the object. Many people see works on 
              TV, in magazines and photos, ie. 2D representations, while they 
              will never see the real thing. So virtual ceramics asks the question: 
              do you still need the real thing? 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              How did your involvement with computer ceramics come about? 
            <P> <IMG align=right SRC="../images/jeroen.gif" alt="virtual teapots"> 
              <B>JB</B> <BR>
              Curiosity, I think. I wanted to make pictures of my thoughts, which 
              was the major reason I started to get involved with computers. I 
              know that I have lots of different ideas in my head which are a 
              big blur -- many images and ideas that I can't control. They come 
              as they wish and I don't like that. I thought that with the help 
              of a graphical computer I would be able to make those pictures. 
              It didn't completely become true, but for a greater part it helped 
              me to explore a different craft. 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              You must have come across people who equated virtual ceramics with 
              CAD/CAM. What is your response to that? 
            <P> <B>JB</B> </P>
            The fun part is that I didn't begin with a CAD/CAM program, many years 
            ago. I stared with a software that was designed for animation. That 
            was to explore things with. At a certain point things emerged that 
            were interesting to show to others and I ended up working for a Korean 
            factory designing steel water kettles, which was quite interesting. 
            But the objects I make don't have anything to do with industry. My 
            virtual work consists of cups that float and vases that stand on a 
            single point. It's quite obvious that my virtual objects are not intended 
            as functional design. These are explorations of what is possible in 
            a different realm, being the world of the computer screen, which will 
            play an ever increasing, enourmous role in our lives in the near future. 
            So the more we live in cyberspace, the more we will need objects to 
            inhabit that space. If you look at 3D software, there are templates 
            for creating 3D scenes -- these images are badly designed, by programmers 
            with no visual skills. It is important to have virtual designers for 
            these virtual environments. 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              Some people have espoused the idea that we will witness a crafts 
              diaspora -- more and more crafts people leaving their chosen medium 
              for the computer terminal... 
            <P> <B>JB</B> <BR>
              I think that's absolute bullocks. It is wonderful to have people 
              explore these notions, but basically it's the same thing that happened 
              with painting at the end of the 19th C, when photography came about. 
              They had to rethink their existence as painters. Now we as crafts 
              people are being confronted with a similar situation, which is computers 
              creating 3D objects, which are similar to photos. This new situation 
              asks new questions. It doesn't mean we would all work with digital 
              craft -- you can't sell these things and to eat you need a bowl. 
              You can't eat from a virtual bowl. So bits and bytes are wonderful 
              to visualise what you have been thinking about. 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              But you are already presenting you work in a different medium -- 
              the Internet. 
            <P> <B>JB</B> <BR>
              That's true. It's just like having images of your work in a magazine. 
              The advantage is that you can create hyperlinks which can improve 
              your exposure. But apart from that, it's just another medium for 
              promoting your work and ideas. 
            <P> <B>SG</B> <BR>
              I'm also interested in hearing about your 'Reconstructions of the 
              Holy Grail'. Where did that idea come from? A particular fascination 
              with the Holy Grail? 
            <P> <B>JB</B> <BR>
              It has to do with the fact that this is a myth of the western world, 
              that has similarities with myths in other cultures as well. It is 
              about a piece of earthenware or whatever that held the blood of 
              Christ and represents in a way all that is good in the world. I 
              try to show how people usually destroy that which is good, and we 
              keep on building and destroying, building and destroying. That is 
              what I make -- the title is more of a handle I give to people, with 
              which they can read the work, rather than a literal adaptation. 
              I don't try to make the Grail, because it never existed. I make 
              reconstructions of the remains of something that never existed, 
              which consists solely of a thought or idea -- just like virtual 
              ceramics. You 'remake' something that doesn't exist, but you are 
              talking about ideas and that is what my work is about, whether it 
              is tactile or virtual.
