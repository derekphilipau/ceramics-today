              (1890-1964)</font></strong></b> <br>
              Italian Realist Painter
            <p align="left">Giorgio Morandi was a 20th C Italian artist, who mainly 
              painted still lifes and landscapes. His still lifes are of particular 
              interest to the potter - ceramic bowls, jugs, vases and other ceramic 
              items were the subjects of his paintings, which he almost religiously 
              painted again and again, sometimes to the extent of painting nearly 
              the same scene over and over, in order to better capture its essence.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/morandi3.jpg" alt="Still Life, 1943" width="176" height="115"></p>
            <p align="left">Morandi was initially influenced by Cezanne, the metaphysicist 
              De Chirico and cubists Braque and Picasso, but he went on to develop 
              his own unique style. It was for his still lifes that he became 
              regarded as one of the main proponents of 20th C representational 
              art.</p>
            <p align="left">Morandi's early work included Cezanne-like portraits 
              and landscapes, then studies inspired by the metaphysicists and 
              cubists. But he developed a penchant for still-life painting early 
              in his career, painting his characteristic compositions as early 
              as the mid 1920s. He went on to develop a style recognizable by 
              its simple composition, muted colors and a loosely held brush with 
              resulting free-flowing lines. Importantly to the potter, his still 
              life subjects were often overlooked everyday ceramic bowls, jugs, 
              candle sticks, bottles and other mundane objects such as salt &amp; 
              pepper shakers, egg cups, a copper saucepan or an old oil lamp.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/morandi2.jpg" alt="Still Life, 1943" width="181" height="150" align="left">Morandi's 
              ceramic objects cannot be attributed to any particular makers, but 
              amongst them we find a fluted bowl reminiscent of David Leach's 
              work, a blue &amp; white striped vase that could have been made 
              by 20th C German potter Hedwig Bollhagen, or italo-french peasant 
              style water jugs. The color schemes of these wares are simple: plain 
              white or clear glazes, cobalt blue, muted iron browns or ochre, 
              but usually understated pastel colors.</p>
            <p align="left">On the surface, Morandi's compositions seem random, 
              but closer scrutiny shows the scenes are contrived, although it 
              would seem not with that much care. Interestingly, the arrangements 
              seem to express a domestic situation, e.g. by stacking several bowls 
              quasi carelessly on top of each other, as if ready for dish washing.</p>
            <p align="left">There is little doubt though, that with these studies, 
              Morandi was trying to glean the essence of painting, by repeating 
              the same scenes over and over again, with little variation, to transcend 
              the objects' and the medium's mediocrity, elevating both, and thus 
              perhaps the also the painter, to a higher plane.</p>
            <p align="left">And therein lies the lure of Morandi's still-life 
              painting - through the representation of the mundane, those objects' 
              beauty is reinforced in us, and through their repetition, they become 
              a member of our own family of familiar, visualized objects.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/morandi1.jpg" alt="Still Life, 1951" width="180" height="163" align="left">Potters 
              can of course also be connoisseurs of other visual arts, and so 
              it comes as no surprise that the painter, who was inspired by the 
              ceramic object, has in turn inspired the potter - perhaps a good 
              example of the old adage &quot;what goes around, comes around&quot;. 
              Gwynn Hanssen Pigott in particular draws inspiration from Morandi's 
              life's work. Her woodfired pieces include slender bottles and simple, 
              unadorned bowls, glazed in muted grays, browns and ochres. Her own 
              ceramic still life arrangements at first mimic, then go beyond Morandi's 
              scenes. Of his work, Hanssen Pigott says &quot;It is about essence; 
              the metaphysical expressed through the solidly physical and knowable.&quot;</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="../images/pigott.jpg" alt="Still life by Hanssen Pigott" width="257" height="107"></p>
            <p align="left">There is no doubt that other ceramic artists have 
              also been influenced to some degree by Morandi's dedication to the 
              still life object - his work appealing to the connoisseur of the 
              'overlooked' in all of us...</p>
