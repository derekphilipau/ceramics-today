              Park - Yorktown
 <p><img src="images/yorktown1.gif" alt="Poor Potter's kiln" width="362" height="312" align="left">Many 
              of Yorktown's citizens were active in events leading to American 
              independence. Best known is Thomas Nelson, Jr., who signed the Declaration 
              of Independence, served as Virginia's governor in 1781 and commanded 
              the Virginia militia during the siege of Yorktown. Another resident, 
              virtually unknown, helped break Great Britain's economic hold over 
              the colonies. Called today the &quot;poor potter&quot; of Yorktown, 
              his pottery factory is the largest known enterprise of its type 
              in Colonial America. Yet more than 250 years after his death, the 
              poor potter remains a mystery.
            <p>For many years the only known clues to the poor potter's existence 
              were large deposits of pottery fragments found in Yorktown. In 1970, 
              however, the remains of his factory were discovered, revealing a 
              large-scale 18th century operation. Evidence also showed the factory 
              had produced quality wares equal to, and in competition with, products 
              made by British potters - a violation of British laws that restricted 
              industrial development in the colonies. How then had the factory 
              been able to operate?</p>
            <p>The search for answers uncovered a 1732 report sent by Virginia's 
              Lieutenant Governor, William Gooch, to the Board of Trade in London. 
              Gooch wrote: &quot;As to manufactures set up, there is one poor 
              Potter's work for course earthenware, which is of so little consequence, 
              that I dare say there hath not been twenty shillings worth less 
              of that commodity imported since it was set up than there was before.&quot; 
              Though Gooch obviously knew about the Yorktown factory, he had allowed 
              it to operate. He also gave the potter an identity - the &quot;poor 
              potter&quot;.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/yorktown1.jpg" alt="Bowls of the 'Poor Potter'" width="253" height="144" hspace="2"><img src="images/yorktown2.jpg" alt="Jugs by the 'Poor Potter'" width="168" height="144" hspace="2"></p>
            <p>Who was the poor potter? Research reveals he was Yorktown entrepreneur 
              William Rogers, who was neither poor nor a potter. Rogers had emigrated 
              to Yorktown around 1710 and a year later had begun his first enterprise 
              - a brewery. By 1720, he was producing pottery at a complex that 
              included two kilns and supporting work areas. A skilled work force 
              crafted at least 23 types of earthenware and stoneware products 
              including milk pans, bowls, bird bottles, mugs, colanders, porringers, 
              churns and chafing dishes. In addition to marketing his wares locally, 
              Rogers sold his goods in the Potomac River region, New England and 
              the West Indies. Though Rogers died in 1739, his family operated 
              the pottery factory for several more years.</p>
            <p>Questions about the poor potter still persist. Why did Lieutenant 
              Governor Gooch allow the factory to operate? Who were the potters? 
              These questions may always remain open for speculation.</p>
            <p><b>Visiting the Poor Potter</b></p>
            <p><img src="images/yorktown2.gif" alt="map" width="313" height="202" align="left">Though 
              archeologists, curators and students of ceramic manufacturing had 
              long suspected that a potter had been at work in Yorktown in the 
              18th century, the location, size and scope of the industry remained 
              a mystery until the last half of the 20th century. Archeological 
              investigations begun in 1966 indicated the general location of the 
              factory and in 1970 the bottom half of a well-preserved potter's 
              kiln was discovered under a garage on Read Street in Yorktown, pinpointing 
              the exact location of William Rogers' operation. Excavations continued 
              until the early 1980s under the direction of Dr. Norman Barka of 
              the College of William &amp; Mary, adding significantly to the information 
              about the role William Rogers and his potters had in establishing 
              economic independence for the Virginia colony.</p>
            <p>Today the remains of the pottery factory are important evidence 
              of the role William Rogers and his potters had in establishing economic 
              independence for the Virginia colony. The factory site is located 
              a short walk from the Yorktown Visitor Center, and one block from 
              the historic Nelson House.</p>
