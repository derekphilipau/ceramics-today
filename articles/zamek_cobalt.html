                <td>Cobalt oxide and cobalt carbonate are ceramic raw materials 
                  widely used by potters. They are frequently found in glaze and 
                  slip formulas contributing, under varied circumstances, a light 
                  to dark blue color depending on the amount employed. Cobalt 
                  has traditionally been used as a decorative blue colorant in 
                  everything from Chinese porcelain to American salt glazed stoneware. 
                  However, its use today reflects a wider problem potters face 
                  when employing any ceramic raw material. The dilemma is not 
                  with the specific raw material but with the lack of pertinent 
                  health statistics relating to the effects of ceramic raw materials 
                  on potters. The available statistics are based on industrial 
                  populations of workers whose exposure and duration rates are 
                  significantly different from potters working in craft centers, 
                  schools, and private studios. In the wider economic world large 
                  industries have the incentive and money to assemble and document 
                  health problems associated with the workplace. There have been 
                  numerous statistical records in commercial areas such as mining, 
                  paper production, and metal industries as to the effects of 
                  raw materials on workers. From the data obtained many procedures 
                  have been enacted for the safe handling of raw materials. </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>There is also an economic incentive for industry to protect its 
              workers to prevent potential litigation. This is not the case with 
              the population of individual potters who have no economic resources 
              for such health related documentation. A central question that has 
              not been addressed is: can an accurate extrapolation of industrial 
              statistics be applied to potters who have lower exposure and duration 
              rates?</p>
            <p>Based on the lack of health and safety statistics as they relate 
              to the small population of potters can it be possible that ceramic 
              raw materials will become the next &#8220;asbestos type&#8221; material 
              for potential litigation? Society in general has become more litigious, 
              a description for taking legal action over a real or imagined injury 
              to a person or damage to property. It is not surprising that this 
              mania has inevitably come to the field of ceramics. It is present 
              even in lawsuits generated from customers scalding themselves from 
              a hot cup of coffee. The economic reactions to lawsuits, or even 
              the possibility of lawsuits, can have a negative effect on ceramics 
              suppliers and eventually on potters who purchase ceramics equipment, 
              supplies, and raw materials. Ceramics is a small industry. In fact, 
              the term industry really does not apply to ceramic supply companies, 
              equipment manufacturers, glaze companies and clay producers who 
              sell to potters involved in this creative activity. For the most 
              part ceramics supply companies are staffed by few employees, and 
              the potters to whom they sell to are individual craftsmen. With 
              such a small market for goods and services, any negative influence 
              on profit margins can have large penalties for producers and consumers 
              of raw materials. Larger industry has the capital and personnel 
              to bear the possibility of legal actions regarding their products 
              or services. Ceramics supply companies do not have staffs of lawyers 
              or high profits to pay for any type of legal action that a raw material 
              complaint might produce.</p>
            <p>Not only can an individual potter be sued but a ceramics supplier 
              can conceivably be named as party to a law suit for selling items 
              to the potter that caused the eventual user real or imagined harm. 
              For example, if a potter sells a coffee cup with a glaze containing 
              cobalt carbonate and the user claims the glaze transferred harmful 
              amounts of cobalt into their body, a problem can exists on many 
              levels. Conceivably the potter who made the pot and the ceramics 
              supplier who sold the raw materials used in the pot could be named 
              in the lawsuit. Such lawsuits are going after &#8220;deep pockets&#8221;, 
              or defendants who can afford to pay damages. Depending on the circumstances 
              of the case a party can be dropped from the suit, but the process 
              does require a lawyer who expects a fee for services. Defending 
              against a potential or actual lawsuit can be an expensive and time-consuming 
              process for any individual or business. Aside from the costs involved 
              in such actions, the tangible area of liability has to be evaluated 
              as to the declared damage inflicted on persons or property. Most, 
              if not all, ceramic supply companies and individual potters would 
              not knowingly allow a situation to exist where a product could inflict 
              damage or illness on their customers, but good intentions have little 
              to do with the factors driving litigation. Even if negligence cannot 
              be assigned, the time and cost to defend oneself is considerable. 
              In many instances even if the case does not go to court legal fees 
              are incurred.</p>

                <td>During the past few years, there has been a steadily increasing 
                  amount of conjecture and embellished claims concerning the use 
                  of raw materials by potters. Many undesirable things can grow 
                  in a climate of ignorance and speculation. Ceramic raw material 
                  toxicology has become increasingly subject to exploitation and 
                  misunderstanding by the uninformed and misguided. Ignorance 
                  of ceramic raw materials by the legal profession and exploitation 
                  by individuals who make their income from distorting data has 
                  increased in the past few years. This disturbing trend is in 
                  part due to the revenue potential associated with any form of 
                  litigation. A steady flow of articles has been published warning 
                  of new ceramic &#8220;poisons of the month.&#8221; The topic 
                  of health factors relating to ceramic materials has attracted 
                  alarmist &#8220;experts&#8221; with access to undiscriminating 
                  print media. Rather than counter such biased reporting knowledgeable 
                  potters and centers of ceramic learning have consistently remained 
                  silent.</td>

            <p> While it is understandable that individuals cannot access the 
              resources to scientifically counter misconceptions regarding ceramic 
              materials, it is inexplicable why places of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; 
              have not undertaken ceramic related health studies to counter false 
              claims and rumors. Research studies on the effects of ceramic raw 
              materials as pertaining to potters are not to be found in colleges 
              offering ceramics. They are frequently introspective institutions 
              looking only toward their own activities and not to the wider population 
              of potters.</p>
            <p><b>Cobalt</b></p>
            <p>Reliable deposits of cobalt are currently mined in Canada and Southern 
              Africa. It is extracted as a by-product of nickel ore mining. Cobalt 
              carbonate (CoC0<sub>3</sub>) and the stronger cobalt oxide (Co0<sub>2</sub>) 
              are metallic coloring agents that have been employed by potters 
              throughout the history of pottery making. It can be found as a decorative 
              element in the earliest 12th century salt glazed ware produced in 
              Germany. Individual artist potters in the United States have been 
              using cobalt in both forms for over fifty years. Cobalt will produce 
              stable blues in oxidation and reduction kiln atmospheres at various 
              temperature ranges. It is one of the most potent colorants and produces 
              a strong blue when added to slips, glazes, and overglaze/underglaze 
              washes. One part of cobalt can tint 100,000 parts of a glaze or 
              slip. This widely used metallic coloring oxide can also generate 
              a range of blues and black in clay bodies. Cobalt can also be found 
              in many commercial glazes, stains, and underglaze colors; large-scale 
              industrial uses of cobalt occur in the formulation of steel and 
              chromium alloys.<sup>1</sup></p>
            <p>A recent court case concerning cobalt carbonate has come about 
              by a confluence of specific events driven by greed, ignorance and 
              an atmosphere of misguided consumer protection. As in most accidents, 
              a series of individual actions aligned themselves in such a way 
              as to produce a flawed outcome for everyone involved. Eventually, 
              ignorance of ceramic raw materials by laymen and &#8220;experts,&#8221; 
              along with the legitimate health concerns of a potter, were brought 
              together with lawyers who did not do their homework.</p>

<p><b>The Potter</b></p>
                  <p>A semi professional potter with over twenty years experience 
                    producing high temperature functional pottery in a garage 
                    studio claimed to have contracted cobalt poisoning. The potter 
                    used approximately 5 lbs. of cobalt carbonate every four years 
                    in various overglaze washes, glazes, and a blue slip. The 
                    slip formula contained two tablespoons of cobalt carbonate 
                    to one cup of slip. It was applied by a brush &#8220;spattering&#8221; 
                    method to green ware. Cobalt slip was loaded onto the brush 
                    and flicked onto the pots. The floor of the pottery studio 
                    was exposed to the excess cobalt slip from mixing and application 
                    operations. A glaze containing 3% cobalt carbonate was mixed 
                    in thirty-gallon containers, which were refilled every three 
                    years. The glaze was applied by dipping or pouring it on the 
                    bisque pottery. The potter glazed 6-8 hours a day 5 days a 
                    week for a 5-month period every year. An overglaze wash containing 
                    60% cobalt carbonate was also brushed over some glazes. The 
                    slips, glazes, and overglazes were applied to a clay body 
                    which was mixed in the studio. All the pots were fired in 
                    a 30 cu./ft., sprung arch downdraft kiln to cone 9 (2300 F.). 
                    The potter has been a pipe smoker for thirty-three years using 
                    approximately 30 pipe fills of tobacco a day. He also consumed 
                    approximately four litters of diet soda a day. He ate, drank, 
                    and smoked in the ceramics studio, which was cleaned periodically 
                    with a garden hose.</p>

                  fatigued, depression, anxiety attacks, headaches, sore mouth, 
                  scalp irritation, poor sleep, and prolonged infections, he visited 
                  his local doctor. After examinations by several physicians, 
                  he was placed on a number of medications to relieve the symptoms 
                  that had been developing over the last fifteen years of working 
                  in his pottery studio. On one of his visits to another doctor 
                  who happened to have taken a pottery course, it was suggested 
                  he might have developed heavy metal poisoning from the cobalt 
                  used in his studio. A hair sample was taken and it was found 
                  to contain cobalt. He was informed it was also possible that 
                  the range of his medical problems fit many of the symptoms associated 
                  with cobalt poisoning. At this time, the potter was given over 
                  ninety-five chelation treatments, which are used to draw out 
                  heavy metals from the system. The potter also did a significant 
                  amount of research on the Internet believing his symptoms fit 
                  cobalt poisoning.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>He then went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and was 
              evaluated by a number of medical specialists including internists, 
              neurologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, psychiatrists 
              and a physician specializing in occupational medicine. Their findings 
              did not indicate heavy metal poisoning. Significantly, blood and 
              urine tests were negative for heavy metal poisoning, but a test 
              did indicate an abnormally high level of arsenic in his blood. However, 
              one doctor did tell him &#8220;symptomatically&#8221; his aliments 
              fit cobalt poisoning, but this opinion was unsupported by the medical 
              facts of the case. In fact, the symptoms for cobalt poisoning are 
              characterized by functional effects on the ventricles and enlargement 
              of the heart (cardiomegaly). There are no demonstrated musculoskeletal 
              or neurologic effects as a result of exposure to cobalt. Gastrointestinal 
              effects primarily from ingestion include, nausea, vomiting, and 
              diarrhea.<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p><b>The Trial</b></p>
            <p>The potter claimed he contracted cobalt poisoning because the ceramic 
              supply company, which sold the cobalt carbonate, did not list safety 
              instructions and precautions on the packages he purchased before 
              1998. His purchases of cobalt carbonate after that year did have 
              safety information but he claimed the labeling was not adequate 
              to inform him of the potential hazards when using the material. 
              In the petition for damages filed by the potter&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s 
              they claimed the cobalt product sold to the plaintiff as designed, 
              constructed, assembled, manufactured and distributed was defective 
              and unreasonably dangerous when put to a reasonably anticipated 
              use. At some point in the presentation his claim was extended to 
              include manganese and arsenic poisoning because the initial test 
              of the cobalt carbonate sample contained arsenic and 5.6 parts per 
              million of manganese as trace materials.</p>
            <p><b>The Potter&#8217;s Position</b></p>
            <p>The potter alleged he was unable to earn a living and could not 
              work as a result of the ceramics supply company&#8217;s negligence 
              due to insufficient labeling of their product, cobalt carbonate, 
              which also contained manganese and arsenic. He had stopped making 
              pottery, which he believed was the cause of his health problems. 
              The potter wanted compensation for economic and pecuniary harm, 
              including, but not limited to, past and future medical bills and 
              expenses and past and future lost wages and income. It was further 
              claimed he suffered and will continue to suffer pain, emotional 
              and psychological harm and distress and loss of enjoyment of life. 
              He believed his symptoms were directly related to the cobalt carbonate 
              contained in his slips and glazes. The claim for damages was in 
              excess of 5 million dollars.</p>
            <p><b>The Ceramics Supply Company&#8217;s Position</b></p>
            <p>The ceramics supply company&#8217;s position was that the safe 
              use of any ceramic raw material was in part the responsibility of 
              the user to inform himself of the health and safety procedures needed 
              when working in the field of ceramics. Based on the potter&#8217;s 
              education and training he should not have been eating, smoking or 
              drinking in his studio. Most significantly, they claimed the potter 
              did not have cobalt, manganese or arsenic poisoning since his extensive 
              medical examination did not indicate such a diagnosis. However, 
              the ceramics supply company was not required to prove what illness 
              or illnesses the potter was suffering from since the onset of his 
              symptoms. Additionally, several physicians and toxicology experts 
              in environmental medicine testified that the potter&#8217;s history 
              of symptoms did not indicate poisoning form any heavy metal, with 
              one physician speculating that the symptoms could be caused by the 
              array of drugs he was taking for unrelated illnesses.</p>
            <p>Evidence was also presented by the ceramics supply company&#8217;s 
              lawyers that demonstrated cobalt, manganese and arsenic poisoning 
              was not found in the population of potters. Previously, this information 
              had been based on anecdotal reports accumulated over fifty years 
              by individual potters and informal surveys taken at the National 
              Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (<a href="http://nceca.net/">NCECA</a>) 
              annual meetings. A statistically accurate study of potters and their 
              use of raw materials was sponsored at the 2000 NCECA meeting. The 
              Potters Health &amp; Safety Questionnaire was issued to all participants.<sup>3</sup> 
              The questionnaire was also listed on the Internet and was available 
              at ceramic supply companies throughout the United States. The results 
              of the survey indicated the four most serious health problems potters 
              encounter in their studios are back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome 
              (repetitive motion), cuts (from glaze shards) and burns (from reaching 
              into hot kilns). While a small percentage of potters reported illnesses 
              attributed to raw materials, a search of the National Library of 
              Medicine data banks and other medical libraries did not reveal any 
              diagnosed cases of potters contracting cobalt, manganese or arsenic 
              poisoning.</p>
            <p>Duke University Medical Center, Department of Community &amp; Family 
              Medicine, Division of Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine 
              had reported that the original cobalt carbonate sample was reanalyzed 
              using a test of greater accuracy and that it did not contain arsenic. 
              Furthermore, it was determined that the hair sample taken from the 
              potter, which was reported as having high concentrations of cobalt, 
              was within normal limits for the general population.</p>
            <p>The most significant finding, of which potters should take note, 
              occurred at Duke University&#8217;s Medical Center for Occupational 
              &amp; Environmental Medicine. The potter&#8217;s actual glaze and 
              slip formulas were tested for respirable and ingestible concentrations 
              of cobalt. The exposure assessment was conducted under controlled 
              conditions duplicating the poor ventilation found in the potter&#8217;s 
              studio. The exposure to cobalt was tested by a modeling technique 
              where each activity was carried out duplicating the actions of the 
              potter in his studio. The glaze and slip formulas were mixed and 
              applied in the same &#8220;spatter&#8221; technique as used by the 
              potter. Respirable exposure and ingestion levels were calculated 
              for an average adult male based on the mixing operations in the 
              potter&#8217;s studio. Test results determined, even allowing for 
              a combination of incidental additive ingestion and inhalation in 
              cleaning, mixing, and glazing activities, daily absorption of cobalt 
              would be in the range of 170-945 micrograms per day. The levels 
              of cobalt the potter was exposed to in his studio were the same 
              as in the general population in the United States. This was reflected 
              in testing hair, blood, and urine, values which fell within the 
              normal range. A risk assessment for cobalt found no adverse effects 
              in humans at exposures of 3400 micrograms per day.<sup>4</sup> The assessment 
              of the potter&#8217;s studio by Duke University&#8217;s Medical 
              Center for Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine is believed 
              to be the first documented case of cobalt material toxicity testing 
              in a private ceramics studio.</p>
            <p>Aside from the environment, the general population is exposed to 
              cobalt from many occupational and consumer sources. The most significant 
              source of cobalt is found in food and drinking water. Food ingestion 
              alone can average 5-100 microns per day. Drinking water levels can 
              average from 2 micrograms per liter to 107 micrograms per liter 
              per day. Background cobalt air levels can range as high as 0.61 
              micrograms.<sup>5</sup> In addition cobalt is found in vitamin B12. A typical 
              multivitamin contains 4 micrograms of cobalt in the form of B12.6. 
              Cobalt is a necessary element, with background exposures from vitamin 
              preparations, water and food in the range of 30-37 micrograms per 
              day.</p>
            <p> <b>The Verdict</b></p>
            <p>The trial was held in the potter&#8217;s hometown and lasted six 
              days. After reviewing the testimony of the ceramics supply company&#8217;s 
              expert witnesses, the potter&#8217;s expert witnesses and the potter, 
              twelve jurors took less than three hours to reach a verdict in favor 
              of the ceramics supply company.</p>
            <p><b>The Impact</b></p>
            <p>The court of law can be an imprecise instrument for solving ceramics 
              related toxicology questions. It is simply the wrong tool for determining 
              the health and safety factors associated with the potter&#8217;s 
              use of ceramic raw materials. This case represents several related 
              issues concerning the current realities in ceramics. First and primary 
              is the potter&#8217;s past and current health and the debilitating 
              symptoms that he is experiencing. An inaccurate assessment by himself 
              and others has caused a delay in the correct medical treatment of 
              his illness. If nothing else, the medical evidence submitted at 
              trial should eliminate cobalt, manganese or arsenic poisoning as 
              the possible causes for his symptoms. Hopefully, the information 
              presented will direct him to the correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>
            <p>The economic impact of the trial on all parties was extensive. 
              Preparation and research for the trial and payment to expert witnesses, 
              in addition to legal and court fees, were substantial. The cost 
              to the ceramic supply company, which is essentially a small business, 
              caused a revision in its selling practices to prevent future litigation. 
              The adjustments will not appreciably increase the safety margins 
              to workers or customers but will increase the costs to customers. 
              Even though the ceramics supply company defended itself successfully 
              many companies will eliminate raw materials and services which might 
              cause legal problems. Such preemptive tactics will not serve potter&#8217;s 
              health interests and will not protect ceramics supply companies 
              from litigation. The economic balance between safe handling and 
              selling of ceramic materials and reducing legal exposure to lawsuits 
              depends in part on access to expert technical advice, which many 
              ceramics companies cannot afford. Defending against this type of 
              litigation for the ceramics company, no matter what the outcome, 
              was a battle that need not have taken place.</p>
            <p>A legitimate array of physical symptoms by the potter, which led 
              to a hair sample test for cobalt, caused the potter to seek legal 
              action. When the symptoms did not match cobalt poisoning, manganese 
              and arsenic poisoning were claimed to be the causes of the potter&#8217;s 
              health issues. While the cobalt carbonate used by the potter did 
              contain 5.6 parts per million of manganese (trace amounts) it did 
              not possess arsenic. Unfortunately, what was needed at the onset 
              of contemplated legal action was not present, namely knowledge of 
              ceramic materials and their toxicological effects on potters. Without 
              this understanding, a course of action was taken, giving an economic 
              incentive for the potter and his lawyers to move proceedings along 
              even when the medical facts did not line up with the physical symptoms 
              of the potter. Once the legal mechanism was underway the cost in 
              time and money for both the defendant and plaintiff started to accrue.</p>
            <p>No one is arguing for less stringent safety procedures in selling 
              raw materials, accurate labeling, or potters adhering to their own 
              studio safety measures. Anything that will promote safety in ceramics 
              should be considered, even though raw materials used by potters 
              have had a good safety record. One step in learning about raw materials 
              can take place when potters request from their ceramic supplier 
              a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for every raw material they 
              purchase. It contains useful information such as the chemical name, 
              chemical family, hazard class, formula, occupational exposure limits, 
              emergency first aid procedures, waste disposal, respiratory protection, 
              and precautions for handling and storage. Each category of information 
              will help the potter establish safety guidelines for raw material 
              handling procedures within their studio. In order to reach a wider 
              audience of potters courses in material safety should be part of 
              every college ceramics and craft center curriculum.</p>
            <p>Raw materials can be handled safely with the proper barrier methods 
              of protection such as National Institute for Occupational Safety 
              &amp; Health (NIOSH) approved respirators, kiln viewing goggles, 
              rubber or latex gloves, and high temperature kiln gloves, to name 
              a few items that should be utilized consistently by every potter 
              in their studio. Raw materials, as used by potters in their studios, 
              have a remarkable safety record considering the varied safety procedures 
              used and not used by potters over the years. There is no room in 
              the ceramics studio for ignorance or misconceptions about raw materials 
              that we as potters come into contact with on a daily basis. When 
              cobalt was placed on trial, it highlighted several areas of future 
              concern for the ceramics community. Ignorance of the toxicological 
              effects of raw materials caused a false diagnosis, which initiated 
              a rush to litigation. The trial caused an economic loss for the 
              potter and the ceramic supply company without an acceptable solution 
              for either party. A lack of knowledge almost perpetuated an incorrect 
              assessment of cobalt carbonate for the pottery community.</p>
