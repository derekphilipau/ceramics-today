  are a field not only known to artists and hobbyists, but one that finds important 
  applications in technical areas as well. While Advanced Heat Engines and Super 
  Conducting ceramics are of interest, the space applications, or so-called <B><A HREF="http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.html">thermal
  protection systems</A></B> are probably generating the most interest at the 
  moment, especially in the light of the current <FONT COLOR="#800000">Mars Pathfinder 
  mission</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR="#800000">Rover Sojourner</FONT>, now conducting 
  experiments on Mars. Ceramic space materials need to withstand temperatures 
  from -250 F in the cold of space to entry temperatures that reach up to 3,000 
  F.</P>

<P>The <FONT COLOR="#800000">Rover Sojourner</FONT> itself is insulated
with <B>Solid
Silica Aerogel</B>, sometimes called &quot;Solid Smoke&quot;, which
is a ceramic related substance similar to glass. This material protects
the Pathfinder from the cold vacuum of space and the carbon dioxide environment
of Mars.</P>

<P>The <FONT COLOR="#800000">Space Shuttle</FONT> also uses ceramic materials, 
  notably <B><A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_sys.html#sts-hrsi">High-Temperature 
  Reusable Surface Insulation Tiles</A></B>, or HRSIs, which, as the name implies, 
  protect the shuttle from the high temperature of re-entry and are reusable for 
  about 100 space missions. The 24,300 tiles don't last forever though, and need 
  to be replaced every now and then. A far cry from the methods of the ceramic 
  artist, the silica fibre <FONT COLOR="#800000">HRSI tiles</FONT> are made by 
  a laser beam assisted computer-controlled machine-tool system. Due to the fibrous 
  structure of the tiles, these also need to be waterproofed. Another ceramic 
  material, Flexible Insulation Blankets are also used on some of the upper surfaces 
  of the orbiter.</P>

<P>With all the excitement being generated by the <B><a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars 
  Pathfinder Mission</a></B>, I hope that many ceramic artists will broaden their 
  horizon and have a look at some more technical uses for ceramics, such as space 
  applications.</P>
