              Watercolors On Porcelain</font></strong></b>
<p> <b>Iron Sulphate</b></p>
            <p> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T" border=0>o 
              get a deep color from Iron Sulphate one needs a highly concentrated 
              solution. To make this, we take 100mls of water and add 100gms of 
              Iron Sulphate. This solution can be applied to bisqued ware, with 
              or without resist decoration. In Fig.2 I have applied the resist 
              material shellac in the form of the stripes and brushed several 
              layers of saturated Iron Sulphate on top. The effect of the resist 
              is to preserve the white porcelain body from the colorant. This 
              technique can be used with any of the metal salts. Sometimes there 
              will be a concentration of color along the edge, where liquid has 
              collected. After decorating, it is necessary to carefully remove 
              any residue of the salts from the shellac (with a sponge or moist 
              tissue), as this will stain the surface underneath in the firing. 
              It may become necessary to let the piece dry in between applications. 
              Iron Sulphate can also be combined with other colorants, eg. Cobalt 
              Sulphate.
            <p> <b>Copper Sulphate</b>
            <p> <IMG SRC="../images/goldate3.jpg" align="left" height="143" width="158" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Copper Sulphate Bowl">I 
              have been lucky, that in my research with Copper Sulphate I have 
              been able to achieve deep reds akin in depth of color to traditional 
              copper red glazes. To achieve this type of color a couple of things 
              are necessary. First of all a strong solution of Copper Sulphate 
              is needed. To get this we dissolve 25-30gms of Copper Sulphate in 
              100 mls of water. This solution is applied in several layers onto 
              a bisqued piece. After an hour or two, as the piece dries, blue 
              crystals should be forming on top of the surface. They may literally 
              grow in front of your eyes. If there seems too little color on the 
              piece, more Copper Sulphate may be added. These blue crystals give 
              an indication of what the piece will look like after firing, only 
              they will have metamorphosed into a deep red! (In contrast, Cobalt 
              Sulphate crystals are pink and turn blue in the firing.)
            <p> The firing cycle is very important. If the piece is oxidised, 
              an insipid yellow color will result and the chemical also tends 
              to attack the clay surface. Work decorated with Copper Sulphate 
              needs to be fired in reduction, as with copper red glazes. The reduction 
              should be medium to heavy, and most importantly, the kiln should 
              be fired down in reduction for the first few hundred degrees, ie. 
              from 1300°C (or whatever the maturing temperature of your porcelain) 
              to about 1000°C, to avoid reoxidation of the copper. When fired 
              in this manner, a deep red should result, with possible grey areas, 
              where the solution was applied more thinly, also the surface stays 
              smooth. In some cases there may even be areas with a silver appearance. 
              Of course a gas kiln will be most suited to this type of firing.
            <p> <b>Gold Chloride</b>
            <p> Gold Chloride can be purchased from laboratory suppliers. I must 
              admit, though, that I have never done this. Instead I use gold lustre 
              which is readily available from potter's suppliers and contains 
              gold chloride. I get quite a good color response from it, although 
              this method isn't exact regarding quantities. I thin the lustre 
              with conventional lustre thinner (4) . The color can be applied 
              with a brush or nib and is clearly visible in contrast to the near 
              colorless water solutions. Gold Chloride is a very reliable colorant 
              in oxidation and reduction and will result in light to deep pinks, 
              depending on concentration.
            <p> <A NAME="potassium"></A> <b>Potassium Dichromate</b>
            <p> This chemical is a bright orange crystal in the raw state and 
              is fairly toxic. Its saturation point is about 12%, after this, 
              it just won't dissolve any more. 12 gms are added to 100mls of water. 
              Because a large amount of this chemical is necessary to get a good 
              color response, the 12% solution needs to be applied in several 
              layers. As with Copper Sulphate, crystals -in this case orange- 
              should grow on the surface whilst drying. If there don't appear 
              to be enough, more solution can be applied. Potassium Dichromate 
              will fire to an olive green in reduction. I find the color can be 
              improved on by a small addition of Cobalt Sulphate, which can be 
              applied separately or added to the solution itself. Potassium Dichromate 
              also lends itself well to the use of resist materials.
            <p> <b>Uranyl Nitrate</b>
            <p> <IMG SRC="../images/goldate4.jpg" align="right" height="136" width="255" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Uranyl Nitrate Setting">This 
              is the most toxic and one of the most expensive of the metal salts. 
              Extreme care needs to be taken when handling this chemical. The 
              remarkable thing about this substance is its capacity to form an 
              edge of concentrated color in combination with Phosphoric Acid, 
              which displaces the color and reveals the whiteness underneath.
            <p> I do strongly recommend to anyone wanting to experiment with Uranyl 
              Nitrate and any of the other chemicals written about in this article 
              to buy a copy of Arne Ase's book, entitled 'Water color on Porcelain', 
              Norwegian University Press, 1989, also published in the USA. It 
              has all the information on how to use the metal salts and also what 
              protective measures should be taken.
            <p> <b>WOP and Glazing</b>
            <p> Normally I don't glaze my work at all. As it is vitrified it will 
              hold liquids without any problem. But the main reason is that the 
              smoothly sanded surface of the unglazed porcelain offers a tactile 
              experience unlike any glazed pieces. Nonetheless, in the case of 
              functional ware that is to be used on a daily basis, it is necessary 
              to glaze the work. In some cases I may glaze only the inside, in 
              other cases the whole piece. Because any application of moisture 
              on the bisqued ware will affect the applied metal salts, a different 
              approach is needed for glazing.
            <p> One solution is to fire the decorated work to the maturing temperature 
              and then glaze at a lower temperature in a subsequent firing. This 
              requires the work to be carefully heated with a burner and the glaze 
              to be meticulously sprayed on with a spray gun. Of course it will 
              be essential to experiment to find a glaze that will fit the porcelain 
              body and the application will need a bit of practice. I use a wide 
              firing high gloss glaze and fire to about 1100°C.
            <p> <IMG SRC="../images/goldate5.jpg" align="left" height="173" width="316" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Uranyl Nitrate Bowls">But 
              even this technique will work with only a couple of the metal salts 
              without changing their appearance. This is the case with Cobalt 
              Chloride and Uranyl Nitrate. There may be other colorants this glazing 
              technique will work with, eg. Bismuth Nitrate or Vanadium Sulphate, 
              but this needs to be looked into. In any case glazing in this manner 
              will not work well with Copper Sulphate, Iron Sulphate or Potassium 
              Dichromate without blurring the crystaline structure of the surface, 
              and if the glazing is done in oxidation (which I normally do), copper 
              will tint the glaze green.
            <p> <b>Calligraphy & WOP</b>
            <p> Because the WOP are chemicals dissolved in water and are much 
              like ink in consistency, it is possible to use them not only with 
              brushes, but also in conjunction with nibs and writing pens. Some 
              of the metal salts will give very reliable results used in this 
              way. Notably those colorants that need only one application can 
              be used for writing on clay. Best of all are Gold Chloride, Cobalt 
              Chloride and Uranyl Nitrate. To stop the colors from migrating, 
              it helps to add some gum arabicum to the water solutions -this thickens 
              the liquid slightly and stops them from blurring. Needless to say 
              that the same precautions must be taken here as with any other decorating 
              technique using metal salts, and extra care needs to be taken not 
              to smudge already decorated areas. These problems aside, writing 
              adds another dimension to the possibilities of the WOP technique.
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> The technique of using watersoluble metal salts is still fairly 
              new and offers plenty of scope for experimentation. While no iron 
              will be magically turned into gold, the WOP technique can yield 
              some really fantastic results, but it can also be disappointing. 
              colors will not always turn out as expected. Metal salts can be 
              fairly unpredictable, because there are so many variables that will 
              influence the outcome (eg. kiln atmosphere, amount of color, degree 
              of vitrification, etc.). But this very same aspect of unpredictability 
              makes it an exciting and sometimes very rewarding technique to work 
              with.
