              Clay Works: American Ceramics from the Everson Museum of Art<br>
              January 16 – March 28, 2003
            <p><br>
              NEW YORK CITY, January 2003 – A new exhibition opening at the <b><a href="http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/1aa/1aa458.html">UBS
              PaineWebber Art Gallery</a></b> explores the development of a distinctly 
              American ceramic tradition in the 20th century. Clay Works: American 
              Ceramics from the Everson Museum of Art, on view from January 16 
              – March 28, 2003, presents the renowned ceramic collection of the 
              <a href="http://www.everson.org/"> <b>Everson Museum of Art</b></a>, 
              which has never before been shown in New York City. Home to the 
              most comprehensive display of American ceramics in the country, 
              the Museum’s reputation as the arbiter of American ceramics is due 
              in part to the Museum’s series of Ceramic National exhibitions, 
              which have displayed works by ceramists at the forefront of the 
              medium since its inception in 1932.<br>
              <br>
              Tracing the evolution of 20th-century ceramics through utilitarian 
              and sculptural works, the exhibition features 120 pieces from the 
              Everson Museum of Art Collection, including pieces by renowned ceramists 
              <a href="http://www.everson.org/pcollection/text/robineau.html"><b>Adelaide
              Alsop Robineau</b></a> and Robert Arneson, as well as a tribute 
              to <b><a href="voulkos.html">Peter Voulkos</a></b>, a master of expressive
              ceramics. Organized thematically, the exhibition features turn-of-the-century 
              Art Pottery and explores the influence of Viennese and Asian styles. 
              The largest section of the exhibition features complex vessel forms 
              and innovative ceramic sculptures created since mid-century, many 
              of which respond to the long tradition of utilitarian ceramics, 
              imaginatively honoring or ironically commenting upon the historical 
              perceptions of pottery.</p>
            <p>Clay Works: American Ceramics from the Everson Museum of Art is 
              made possible by UBS PaineWebber Inc.</p>
            <p> <b>Exhibition Highlights</b><br>
              Following on the heels of the nation’s centennial, the Art Pottery 
              movement self-consciously set out to elevate the character of American 
              ceramics by combining high standards of craftsmanship with a deliberately 
              artistic intent. While many museums have exhibited ancient utilitarian 
              vessels, the Everson Museum of Art has long collected innovative 
              ceramic sculptures and non-traditional vessels, beginning with the 
              1916 acquisition of 32 porcelains by Adelaide Alsop Robineau. A 
              Syracuse resident and leader of the Art Pottery movement, Robineau 
              displayed the movement’s style in works like Lantern (1908) and 
              Viking Ship Vase (1905), which also evince the natural world and 
              Japanese exoticism popular in the Art Pottery movement.</p>

            <p><img src="images/voulkos.jpg" alt="Tall Covered Jar, 1956" width="186" height="280" align="left">A 
              focus of the show will be the works of Peter Voulkos, one of the 
              most renowned American abstract ceramists, who died in February 
              2002. A fearless innovator, Voulkos developed a unique style inspired 
              by Japanese pottery and Abstract Expressionist painting, reinventing 
              ceramics as a meeting ground for painting and sculpture. In his 
              shocking 1973 series of “torn plates,” Voulkos created visually 
              assertive works by tearing, gouging and puncturing the clay. His 
              diverse artistic influences merged in works such as Tall Covered 
              Jar (ca. 1956), which combines Abstract Expressionist painting with 
              traditional Japanese ceramic form. Works by Voulkos’ talented California 
              colleagues, such as Rudy Autio and Paul Soldner, will also be displayed.</p>
            <p>Another renowned ceramist highlighted in the exhibition is Robert 
              Arneson, a leader of the 1970s Funk movement. Arneson’s Five Splat 
              (1976), a series of self-portraits capturing the reactions of a 
              face being splattered with brown clay, and Mountain and Lake (1975), 
              a momentous architectural installation, helped establish ceramics 
              as a major sculptural medium.</p>
            <p><img src="images/makins.jpg" alt="Makins, Junihito, 1992" width="189" height="154" align="left">Figurative 
              sculpture is also featured in the exhibition. Thelma Frazier Winter’s 
              The Juggler (c. 1949) is rooted in the irreverent Viennese tradition 
              that reached American artists in the 1930s. This piece, depicting 
              a medieval jester juggling upside-down, epitomizes Viennese humor 
              and figural style. Viktor Schreckengost’s political work The Dictator 
              (1939) features a seated Nero playing his lyre, as putti representations 
              of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Hirohito climb his throne. Warning 
              of the impending danger he witnessed in Europe, Schreckengost’s 
              work is both witty and provocative. Rudy Autio’s Double Lady Vessel 
              (1964) explores and reinvents this tradition by uniquely merging 
              figurative, sculptural, decorative and vessel forms.</p>
            <p>Diverse cultural and artistic influences can also be seen in the 
              exhibition, such as the Japanese ceramic style as interpreted by 
              Paul Soldner and Paul Chaleff, artists who embrace chance and honor 
              the inner strength and richness of their materials. Other works 
              display Pop Art influences, such as Roy Lichtenstein’s splatter-painted 
              sculpture Dinnerware, or explorations of the Super-Object, exemplified 
              by Richard Shaw’s Whiplash! (1978), a trompe l’oeil sculpture that 
              meticulously mimics a house of cards, and <a href="../potw/levine.html"><b>Marilyn
              Levine</b></a>’s Maki’s Shoulder Bag (1975), which realistically 
              expresses the suppleness of a leather purse. <font size="-2"></font></p>
