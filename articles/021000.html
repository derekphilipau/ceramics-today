      <H3>Photographing Your Own Work</H3>
      <p> <IMG SRC="../images/g_gills.gif" alt="G" width="48" height="54" align="left"> 
      <p>etting your work photographed by a professional photographer can be quite 
        expensive, but you can achieve comparable quality with your own equipment 
        in your own home with a bit of experimenting and some helpful hints. Many 
        bad photographs of ceramic work are due to reasons easily rectified. However 
        getting that really professional looking shot does take a bit of experience. 
        Non-the-less, this article should shed some light on some basic rules 
        of photographing your pottery, ceramic sculpture or any other artwork 
        for that matter. 
      <h5>Basic requirements</h5>
      <p>First of all you will need a good, basic SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera 
        with a tripod. If you are trying to take great photos of your work with 
        a throwaway camera you probably won't get the results you were hoping 
        for. Most camera bodies will fulfill pretty much the same function, it's 
        the actual lens where you start getting great quality differences. So 
        make sure you have a good, crisp, clear lens, preferably a 50mm with a 
        macro (close-up) capability. 
      <p>Secondly, make sure you have the right film type. If you are photographing 
        outdoors, a standard 100 ASA film will probably do. If you are photographing 
        indoors or in subdued light, you should think about getting a 200 ASA 
        or even a 400 ASA film. If you are photographing indoors with tungsten 
        light (normal bulb light) you might consider getting a special tungsten 
        film. However this is only good if you intend shooting the whole roll 
        indoors. 
      <p><img src="../images/diyphoto7.jpg" width="105" height="150" align="left" hspace="10" alt="example with a good backdrop" vspace="10">Thirdly 
        -- and this is where most people make shortcuts -- get hold of a professional 
        graduated photography backdrop. This is a large sheet (1m x 1.5 m or about 
        3 x 4.5 feet) of thick laminated paper or plastic that is black or dark 
        blue on one end and gradually fades into white at the other. Get black 
        fading into white -- no other colors -- they won't look good and will 
        distract from the work. If you aren't going to be doing enough photography 
        over the years to warrant the expense, a large plain sheet of white paper 
        (sometimes obtainable for free at newspaper printers) or some other large 
        sheet of artistic paper (e.g. marbled, as in the examples below) will 
        do -- but the results won't be as good. 
      <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
      <h5>Indoors or Outdoors?</h5>
      <p>While it is possible to take good shots outdoors, many people make the 
        mistake of photographing their work in an outdoor setting, with plants, 
        garden furniture, footpaths, pets and the like visible in the picture 
        -- not good! You want to keep the photo as simple as possible so nothing 
        distracts from the work. If you want to photograph outside, let's say 
        for lighting reasons, try and set up a backdrop in a light but shaded 
        area. Direct sunlight will create strong shadows and undesirable highlights 
        on shiny surfaces.</p>
      <p>Better to set up shop indoors in a very light room, with sunlight filtering 
        into the room, but not directly onto the work you are photographing. Alternatively, 
        you might use the sunlight, but dampen it by tacking a white sheet or 
        paper to the window. If there is insufficient light available, you will 
        have to resort to using artificial lighting with either the right film 
        type or with filters. If you are thinking of using artificial light, try 
        getting hold of two 200 watt bulbs and place these behind some large sheets 
        of tracing paper, to soften the light and avoid strong shadows. If you 
        are using tungsten light and normal outdoor film, you will also need a 
        blue filter, but this is a very tricky area and too complex to cover in 
        this article. You will just have to experiment. Never take photos with 
        neon light, as this is extremely difficult (even for pros) to counterbalance 
        and you will most likely get a strong green cast.</p>
