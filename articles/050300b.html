              edgwood was continually seeking to lighten the color. of this earthenware 
              and by 1775 achieved this goal by additions of Cornish stone. The 
              Cream Ware was often decorated using a new technique called transfer 
              printing (which is widely used in the ceramic industry today), a 
              technique devised by John Saddler of Liverpool with whom Wedgwood 
              collaborated from 1761 onwards, using the process throughout his 
              whole period of creating. Later this technique was enhanced by the 
              addition of hand painting to fill in areas in color. This innovation 
              of using the transfer printing technique on ceramics should not 
              be underestimated as it "...gave the pottery a sophistication that 
              enabled it to vie on artistic grounds with porcelain, while the 
              cost of the finished articles was much less. In a particular instance 
              of decorative treatment there was nothing to choose in appearance 
              between cream ware, Delftware and porcelain." 
            <p> The contemporary taste called also for vases carved from stone, 
              such as agate, granite or marble. Wedgwood saw here an opportunity 
              to gain a share of the market by producing a ceramic ware that closely 
              resembled these stone vases. The technique he used was not new, 
              is called marbling and is still used today. On top of the 'marbled' 
              clay he used different transparent glazes giving a tortoiseshell 
              effect. He also invented a technique where oxides were sprinkled 
              onto the vases and a clear lead glaze applied on top. 
            <p> Another of Wedgwood's accomplishments was his so-called 'Pearl 
              Ware', at first called 'Pearl White', which was introduced in 1779. 
              After searching for one and a half decades for a whiter body, Wedgwood 
              accomplished this by additions of kaolinic Cornish clay. In some 
              publications the opinion is voiced that cobalt oxide was used to 
              'whiten' the glaze similar to a laundry bleach, but this may stem 
              from the fact that cobalt was used in the underglaze decoration. 
              (See David Buten: 18th C Wedgwood) This 'Pearl Ware', which was 
              often executed in the same shapes as the 'Cream Ware' also found 
              liking at the royal court and both wares existed side by side. 
            <p> In 1769, around the time of the rise of neoclassicism in Europe 
              (Winckelmann's 'Thoughts on the Imitation of Creek Works' was published 
              in 1755 and his 'History of Ancient Art' in 1764), Wedgwood devised 
              a new clay body which was to be known as 'Black Etruscan' or 'Black 
              Basalt' ware. This was a clay body made from a red iron-bearing 
              clay with additions of manganese- dioxide, which gave it it's black 
              color. The formula rendered the body quite hard and dense after 
              firing and it was possible to give it a highly polished finish.
