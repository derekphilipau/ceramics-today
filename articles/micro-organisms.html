            <p>Micro-organisms are present everywhere in our environment: 
              in air, water, on surfaces, and on individuals of all kinds. They 
              are invisible and relatively unperceived. Micro-organisms are very 
              numerous: 1 gram of earth may contain up to 25 billions micro-organisms 
              (4 times the population of our planet).</p>
            <p>Conditions for the development of micro-organisms 
              in ceramics products are related to the presence of nutritive elements 
              under the influence of temperature, moisture and pH of the medium. 
              Under favorable conditions, putting together these various factors, 
              one estimates that the population of micro-organisms can double 
              every 20 minutes... Therefore starting from a few micro-organisms 
              placed in a favorable medium, a true contamination can occur in 
              less than one day. The bacterial growth curve comprises a phase 
              of logarithmic increase followed by a stationary phase, then by 
              a phase of decline when food is suddenly lacking. </p>

            <p ALIGN="left"><B>Which are the signs of a microbial invasion in 
              an aqueous product?</B></p>
            <p>In general, one observes changes, in the color 
              of the surface, viscosity, value of pH accompanied by odors and 
              gaseous emissions as well as variations in the behavior of the product. 
              One can determine the level and type of contamination by using indicators 
              containing gelose which make it possible to grow micro-organisms 
              quickly (48 to 96 hours), to quantify and identify according to 
              appearance, bacteria, yeasts or mushrooms. </p>
            <p> <B>Hygiene of manufacturing:</B> 
            <p>The hygiene of manufacturing often takes place 
              at the beginning of a bacterial contamination, on this matter it 
              is necessary to take care of the following points: </p>
            <p><B>Treated water:</b> </p>
            <p>water generally used in the workshop and biocid (<B>1</B>) added, 
              to rinse work containers after cleaning them in order to destroy 
              residual micro-organisms. </p>
            <p><B>To introduce a biocide at the beginning of manufacturing:</b> 
              The biocid must be introduced into the product to be protected at 
              the beginning of the preparation of the aqueous phase (product to 
              be protected + workshop water + biocid). This is for ensuring the 
              protection of the product, but also for avoiding putting out of 
              order its properties (mainly viscosity), because the biocid pH can 
              modify those considerably. </p>
            <p> <B>To protect liquid organic additives by a biocide: </b>Liquid 
              additives containing organic matter must also be protected by a 
              biocid in order not to act as contamination vectors during their 
              introduction into the preparations (i.e. . Liquid glazes in which 
              aqueous glue added CMC is introduced. This preparation of glue must 
              be treated by a biocid when manufactured to allow its preservation). 
            <p> <B>To entirely clean up facilities:</b> To use disinfectant added 
              workshop water (i.e. sodium hypochlorite or bleach(<B>2</B>), an 
              effective and rather economic product, little polluting) to clean 
              containers having stored a contaminated product. 
            <p> <b>To use disinfectants during cleaning </b><br>
              <b>To avoid complex and difficult to clean piping(dead lines) </b><br>
              <b>To keep pipes and containers empty and dry when not in use</b><br>
              <b>Beware of dust.</b> 
            <p><B>(1) Biocid:</b> anti-bacterial and anti-fungic substance for 
              preventive use. The aqueous medium necessary to the implementation 
              of the majority of ceramic products must be protected by biocids 
              chosen for their compatibility with these and introduced at the 
              beginning of the aqueous phase taking into account their pH. </p>
            <p>Exemples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Mixture of chlorinated and non chlorinated isothiazolon compounds, 
                pH 3.5 + / - 0.5 </li>
              <li> Aqueous solution of ortho-phenylphenol potassium salts, pH 
                &gt; 13</li>
              <li> 10% solution derived from oxazin with sulphur and nitrogen 
                heterocyclic compounds, pH 10-11</li>
              <li> Aliphatic compound with sulphur heterocyclic compounds, pH 
                3-5 </li>
            </ul>
            <p><B>(2) Bleach:</b> Note that bleach is an excellent disinfectant, 
              but its high pH and its short duration effect make it a temporary 
              cleaning material not very compatible, as a stable protective biocide, 
              with ceramic products </p>
            <p><B>In ceramics:</B></p>
            <p><B>1-In liquids:</B></p>
            <p>The majority of disorders seen in liquid glazes 
              are due to bacterial activity which strongly modifies viscosity 
              and produces odors. </p>
            <p>These disorders generally occur with natural products 
              containing organic matters (e.g. clays), under the effect of heat 
              and minerals concentration (High density of liquid glazes). For 
              sure, if the glaze contains glue, it is even worse because the organic 
              matters of the adhesives are very appreciated nutrients by bacteria. 
            </p>
            <p>There are often two distinct phases in the deterioration 
              of viscosity in the event of bacterial attack: </p>
            <p>- Fluidification due to the consumption of the 
              components of the adhesive(glue) used in the glaze. </p>
            <p>- Flocculation or thickening due to the acid dejections 
              of bacteria following the consumption of the organic elements of 
              glazes. It is then necessary to rectify this situation by correcting 
              the parameters of viscosity by adding adhesive or deflocculant in 
              the glaze containers.</p>
            <p><B>2) In porous moulds:&nbsp;</B></p>
            <p>The storage and maintenance of porous resin moulds 
              for casting under high pressure require an anti-bacterial and anti-fungic 
              action. The mould capillary network is rather large (10 to 20 µ) 
              and clay fines penetrate into it. Bacterial activity, in the mould 
              layer impregnated with fines, leads to the filling of the pores 
              not easily curable by chemical action(When this filling is on the 
              surface, the mechanical action of a high-pressure water spray makes 
              it possible to cure this problem). The best solution consists in 
              permanently having an anti-bacterial and anti-fungic preventive 
              action during the startup of the mould, for its cleaning and its 
              storage.</p>
            <p> <B>The role of biocides: </B> 
            <p>Biocides are products with anti-bacterial and anti-fungic 
              action. They are products for preventive action, generally used 
              at very low doses (high cost, toxicity) and their action on the 
              rheology of liquid glazes is not to be neglected (due to the biocide 
              pH ). </p>
            <p>The most current biocides are introduced at the 
              beginning of the preparation, in the mixing water at a rate of 0,05% 
              to 0,50% by weight. </p>
            <p>In ceramics, biocides which are bactericide-fungicide 
              with broad spectrum activity, containing sulphureous aliphatic and 
              heterocyclic compounds of low toxicity, are often used.</p>
            <p>Careful, in too low doses, these products will 
              not have the expected effect and will give a false sense of security 
              because they can under certain conditions favour a selective adaptation 
              on the part of the micro-organisms. In too large doses, they will 
              be too expensive, their toxic effects will be enhanced, and risks 
              of pollution are possible.</p>

            <p><B>1-Definition:</B></p>
            <p>Infections among patients whose defence mechanisms 
              are weakened, and that make individuals particularly susceptible 
              to infections. These infections are due to micro-organisms usually 
              which are not very pathogenic. </p>
            <p>Defence mechanisms, physiological, immunological 
              can be disturbed, or a breach </p>
            <p>made in them, by a disease, a traumatism, or by 
              procedures or products used for diagnostic or therapeutic goals. 
            </p>
            <p>Following are a few exemples.</p>
            <p><B>2 - Antibiotics and host defence mechanisms reduction.</B></p>
            <p>A treatment by antibiotics modifies the normal 
              flora of the skin, mucous membranes, digestive tract, and can lead 
              to colonization of these organs by new micro-organisms. </p>
            <p>This colonization is inoffensive if it is not followed 
              by superinfection (invasion by indigenous germs, or micro-organisms 
              from the environment). </p>
            <p><B>Predisposing factors are:</B></p>
            <UL>
              <LI>Extremes of life</LI>
              <LI>Chronic infections</LI>
              <LI>Debilitating diseases</LI>
              <LI>Use of excessive amounts of antibiotics</LI>
            </UL>
            <p>- Use of broad spectrum antibiotics</p>
            <p><B>3 - Modifications of anatomical barriers:</B></p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li> Patients suffering from extensive burns</li>
              <li>Patients having undergone therapeutic or diagnostic procedures.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The normal anatomical barriers of these patients 
              are broken and they can not fight infections any more.</p>
            <p><B>4 - Disturbances of cellular or humoral defence mechanisms: 
              </B></p>
            <p>Neoplastic and immunodeficiency diseases.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Leukemias </li>
              <li>Myelomas </li>
              <li>Aplastic anemia </li>
              <li>AIDS</li>
              <li>Gammapathies</li>
              <li>Systemic lupus erythematosus</li>
              <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>
            Treatments by radiotherap; Intensive immunosuppressive therapy, etc. 
            <p><B>5 - Cytotoxic drugs:</B></p>
            <p>Opportunist infections are then due to a severe 
              leucopenia (lowering of white blood cells).</p>
            <p><B>6 - Corticosteroids:</B></p>
            <p>Their systemic use disturbs many aspects of host 
              defence mecanisms.</p>
            <p>In addition, those who suffer from Cushing‘s syndrome 
              (increased secretion of an endogenous corticosteroid, cortisol) 
              have an increased susceptibility to infections. </p>
