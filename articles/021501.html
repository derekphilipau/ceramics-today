        idea of a feast, from a potter&#8217;s standpoint, must surely include tableware 
        that is valued, exciting, and reflecting of the personality of the artist 
        who made the work. The enjoyment of any meal is enhanced by the serving 
        dishes, the plates, cups and bowls used in the regular ritual of eating. 
        The idea, however, to make tableware a focus of another event at Gulgong 
        (following Woodfire &#8217;89, Fire-Up &#8217;92, Claysculpt &#8217;95 and Hyperclay &#8217;98) 
        involves more than that. It is time, <img src="../images/visgirda.jpg" width="108" height="68" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3">Janet 
        Mansfield believes, to ensure that potters can make a living from the 
        sale of their work. And, in addition to their one-off gallery or museum 
        pieces, it should be possible that they could be inspired to make lively, 
        innovative and imaginative tableware, individual pieces or sets, that 
        would enable them to make a living at what they like to do; that is, work 
        with clay, pigments and fire, in their own studios and at their own pace. 
      <p><img src="../images/kaneko.jpg" width="93" height="138" align="left" alt="Jun Kaneko" vspace="3" hspace="3">To 
        this end, Mansfield has invited 13 master-artists from around the world 
        to come to Gulgong, a town on the central tablelands of NSW, Australia, 
        to work with potters, to talk and eat, look at ways we can enjoy the life 
        of potters in the best way possible. The success of previous events could 
        mean that an excess of 350 people could converge on this small town, bringing 
        their work with them, meeting others with similar purposes: teachers, 
        students, full-time potters, part-time potters, appreciators of the potter&#8217;s 
        art. There will be demonstrations and lectures each day, hands-on decorating 
        of the participants&#8217; own work, firing the woodfired &#8216;merry-go-round&#8217; kiln, 
        exhibitions, happenings, and a few surprises as well. Each participant 
        is invited to bring six pieces of tableware for a mammoth display in the 
        Memorial Hall. They anticipate they will show thousands of pots on the 
        theme of feasting.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miller.jpg" width="93" height="91" align="left" alt="David Miller" vspace="3" hspace="3">The 
        masters leading the demonstrations will hold an exhibition of their work 
        and, in addition, be on hand to supervise the participants decorating 
        their own pieces to be fired with the involvement of everyone at Mansfield&#8217;s 
        Morning View studio. John Gibson, author of the book, Pottery Decoration, 
        and head of ceramics at the new school for ceramics and glass in Bornholm, 
        Denmark, will lead a forum, in conjunction with Janet DeBoos, head of 
        the ceramics department at the Canberra School of Art, for teachers and 
        students. The town of Gulgong will host displays of pots in the shop windows 
        and we plan a number of events that will involve active participation 
        and discussion.</p>
