              <b>by Edmund De Waal</b> </font> <b><strong><font color="#274F76" size="4">

            <p> Bernard Leach is regarded as one of the great potters of the 20th 
              century. He spent eleven years in Japan, from 1909 to 1920, after 
              which he returned to England to set up the St. Ives pottery and 
              to spread the message of ceramics the Oriental way. His influence 
              through his writings and as mentor of many successful English potters 
              has earned him a reputation as pivotal reformer of Western ceramics. 
              Edmund De Waal's book Bernard Leach (St. Ives Potters) takes a refreshing 
              and critical look at Leach's life and accomplishments, offering 
              a healthy, at times dissenting view to the normal assumptions of 
              exactly what Leach contributed to 20th C pottery. </p>
            <p><img src="../images/dewaal.jpg" width="100" height="140" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="2">It 
              is little known that Leach seldom threw his own pots, but rather 
              had them made for him to decorate. He dismissed traditions, that 
              didn't fit into his concept of ceramics, such as those of French 
              stoneware potters or Italian Maiolica artists. He ignored ceramic 
              sculpture, proposing that art school traditions fostered a lack 
              of skill masked by arty conceit amongst students. He preached humility, 
              but was himself quite an autocratic character. </p>
            <p> De Waal's book offers a somewhat different view from that propagated 
              by the Leach's followers. I would say that it was quite an objective 
              one and that this is a valuable book on Leach's lifes work. It is 
              dissenting at times but not overly critical and certainly not disrespectful 
              of the Old Master. It takes you through various stages in Leach's 
              life fairly objectively. Actually De Waal probably could have been 
              much more critical of some of Leach's idiosyncrasies. However many 
              people will not agree with some of the criticisms. One reader, posting 
              a review on the Net, described the book as &quot;a bitter attack 
              on the man who was solely responsible for the renaissance of the 
              pottery movement in Britain at the early years of the century&quot;. 
              I cannot share this view at all. However, if you don't want to know 
              about criticisms of Leach's legacy, this book is not for you.<font size="2">
