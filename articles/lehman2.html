              <b>An 11-Course Meal, Mishima Style</b> 
            <p align="center"> <img src="images/lehman/lehman-hanaoka-yutaka-photo.jpg" width="348" height="273"><br>
              Kohiki Potter Hanaoka Yutaka and Dick Lehman<br>
            </p>
              
            <p>By good fortune, I arrived at the Kyoto Station at just the right 
              time to catch the Hikari Super Express Train to Mishima. I arrived 
              at the Mishima Station at about 4 pm, made a phone call to Robert 
              Yellin, and within a few minutes we were walking back to his E-Yakimono.Net 
              office. While Robert completed some end-of-the-day work, I had a 
              wonderful hour to begin to peruse his extensive library, and handle 
              the many pots that, up to now, I've only seen as images on Robert's 
              <a href="http://www.japanesepottery.com/"> <b>japanesepottery.com</b></a> 
              site and <a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/"><b>e-yakimono.net</b></a>. 
              It was a generous visual feast, and a wonderful initiation to my 
              time in Mishima. After an hour we walked less than half a block 
              to continue our feast (Course #2), this time at a neighborhood restaurant, 
              where choosing from the day's specialties was as easy as selecting 
              from the freshly made daily entrees positioned in generous bowls 
              on the bar in front of our seats. And what a timely evening to have 
              been &quot;in the neighborhood&quot; -- as it was the night of the 
              Japan/Portugal World Cup Soccer game. The delightfully raucous crowd 
              seemed a warm welcome to the neighborhood, even though our host 
              behind the counter felt the need to apologize for their behavior. 
              &quot;They become like children again,&quot; she nodded. I could 
              only smile. </p>
            <p>Later that night at his home, Robert introduced me to a significant 
              portion of his collection of ochoko sake cups and tokkkuri sake 
              bottles. The &quot;meal&quot; continued (Course #3) as we spent 
              several hours learning to know (in the only real way that one can 
              come to know these sake utensils) a significant number of these 
              gems -- pouring and sipping with a certain restraint, but enjoying 
              with abandon. I was particularly moved by the <a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/m-furutani.html"><b>Furutani 
              Michio</b></a> and the <a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/r-kakurezaki.html"><b>Kakurezaki 
              Ryuichi</b></a> cups, which were sensitively bold and spiritual 
              little works that spoke of more than sake -- works which told us 
              about the life and heart and spirit of their makers. </p>
            <p>The next morning (Course #4), we unpacked a new shipment of yellow 
              Seto works that had just arrived at Robert's office, followed by 
              a hour in the &quot;back room&quot; (Course #5) with permission 
              to look through the stacks and stacks of paulownia-boxed pots, untying 
              and retying the silk cords as a ritual pause between each delightful 
              discovery. </p>
            <p>After lunch we went to visit Hanaoka Yutaka (Course #6). Hanaoka 
              is a potter who makes &quot;kohiki&quot; ware (dark iron-bearing 
              clay, covered with white slip, and glazed with a clear glaze).</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm firing my strange anagama today,&quot; said Hanaoka. 
              &quot;But you may come for a visit.&quot; His &quot;strange&quot; 
              anagama, as it turned out, was designed more like my own unconventional 
              wood-fired kiln than any other kiln I have ever seen (see below 
              photos). We shared a laugh when I showed him photos of my equally 
              &quot;strange&quot; design. However, instead of using it for long 
              15-day &quot;yakishime&quot; firings as I have been doing, Hanaoka 
              san was using his kiln for shorter firings, bringing the glazed 
              pots to 1270 degrees centigrade in roughly 28 hours. </p>

              Dick Lehman's &quot;Strange&quot; Kiln </p>
            <p>A large storeroom (Course #7) of these quiet and austere kohiki 
              works was opened to us. I was nearly overwhelmed with the simplicity 
              and quietness of a large body of these works, all located in one 
              place. But I managed to select a few cups, a bowl, a tray and a 
              sake server to take home with me. And since returning home and having 
              begun to use these works, I have started (Course #8) to understand 
              their understated genius. Can you imagine the sublime violet-colored 
              reflected light emanating from the inside of one of these pearlescent 
              little facetted cups when filled with my homemade gooseberry wine? 
              Or just imagine the four-footed rectangular tray offering sauted 
              zucchini flowers fresh from my garden. Allow yourself the enjoyable 
              thought of homemade dandelion wine, the color of springtime, being 
              poured from the sake server. </p>

              Five Kohiki Mentori Cups by Hanaoka Yutaka </p>
            <p>Supper was portside in Numazu City (Course #9), at a sushi restaurant 
              right across from the fish docks, where I ordered the local special 
              (fish caught in local waters). Upon Robert's recommendation, I also 
              had the freshest sushi I have ever eaten (Course #10). In almost 
              less time than it takes to read this, the fish was caught with a 
              net from the tank, scaled, filleted, de-boned, and the resulting 
              filets cut into bite-size pieces. The remaining head/backbone/tail 
              was skewered and bent into a basket shape and nestled on a snow-white 
              pile of shredded daikon (radish), the bite-size morsels nestled 
              into the &quot;basket,&quot; and the plate set in front of me. As 
              I touched it with my chopsticks to take my first bite, the nervous 
              reflexes of the moments-ago-swimming-fish, caused its mouth and 
              gill flaps to open and close, a behavior it &quot;chose&quot; to 
              continue throughout the duration of my delicious feast! </p>
            <p>The evening closed, and my time in Numazu came to an end with a 
              visit to Brian Baird's Fishmarket Taproom (Course #11), a US-style 
              microbrewery located portside in Numazu City. I'm not entirely sure 
              that it was not the effects of my third round of Rising Sun Ale, 
              but in that moment I had a hard time wrapping my mind around the 
              idiosyncratic assemblage in which I found myself that evening -- 
              me, an American potter in Japan to study Japanese ceramic traditions 
              and to help edit a Japanese pottery text, sitting in a Japanese 
              bar run by an American who brews Japanese beer in the Pacific-Northwest 
              style (the brewery is modeled after a small brewery just 60 miles 
              from my house in Indiana), while seated next to me is Robert Yellin, 
              an American who lives in Japan, runs two web sites, writes for the 
              Japan Times, and specializes in ceramic education. Together, here 
              in this place after having eaten the freshest sushi ever consumed! 
              A truly resplendent evening!</p>
