                <p><img src="images/deck/zillij3.jpg" width="132" height="203" align="left">In 
                  the mid-19th century, Europe's artistic and fashionable&#160;circles 
                  were enthralled by a&#160;vogue for all that was Oriental. Visitors 
                  to London Galleries and Paris salon exhibitions became familiar 
                  with Middle Eastern desert and village life, with Arab, Persian 
                  and Turkish costume and decorative arts as they were recorded 
                  - or sometimes imagined - on canvas or in watercolor by European 
                  artist-travelers. <i>De rigueur</i> for Victorian ladies were 
                  the sumptuous, colorfully patterned paisley shawls, while loose, 
                  cool pajamas, as worn in the Islamic world, were adopted into 
                  the well-dressed European male's wardrobe. European homes featured 
                  the new "divan" associated with life&#160;&#224; <i>l'orientale</i> 
                  - furniture that invited lounging and relaxation - and the Turkish 
                  bath was introduced to Paris.</p>
                <p>The preferred jewelry 
                  motif was the so-called Algerian knot.</p>
                <p>Against this backdrop, 
                  the acquisition of a single brilliantly colored Islamic tile 
                  prompted French ceramist Joseph-Th&#233;odore Deck to explore 
                  and revive Middle Eastern ceramic techniques in the creation 
                  of his own unique art.</p>
                <p>Deck, the first of 
                  the artist-potters in what was to become a widespread revolution 
                  in European ceramics, was born in the Alsatian town of Guebwiller 
                  in 1823. He dreamed of becoming a sculptor, but his modest background 
                  dictated a more prosaic vocation. Deck apprenticed as a maker 
                  of ceramic stoves - large, room-warming structures of ironand 
                  plaster often elaborately covered with ceramic tiles - and traveled 
                  to Germany, Austria and Hungary to learn his trade. Moving to 
                  Paris in1847, he worked as a foreman in a ceramic stove factory.</p>
                <p>But by 1856, Deck 
                  had established his own decorative fa&#239;ence workshop in 
                  partnership with his brother Xavier and nephew Richard. Painters 
                  and sculptors frequented "Atelier Deck," which became a design 
                  laboratory promoting ceramics as an art form in the face of 
                  prevailing industrial practices.</p>
                <p><img src="images/deck/vase_deck.jpg" width="158" height="303" align="left">For 
                  Th&#233;odore Deck, the 1850's were an exciting decade of technical 
                  research and experimentation. Paradoxically, Deck looked back 
                  into history to develop new and improved ceramic techniques. 
                  He began by exploring lost Renaissance processes, making elaborate 
                  ceramics resembling those of Frances Saint-Porchaire factory, 
                  extravagantly decorated with inlaid strapwork patterns and incrustation. 
                  Next, tantalized by the secrets locked within the luminescent 
                  glaze of his one Islamic tile, Deck began to unravel the mysteries 
                  of centuries-old ceramics techniques of that culture. He wanted 
                  to know more.</p>
                <p>Since the Middle 
                  Ages, Islamic ceramics had been admired in Europe as much for 
                  their luscious, rich glazes as for their abundant and colorful 
                  decoration (See <i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199202/">Aramco 
                  World,</a></i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199202/"> 
                  March-April 1992</a>). Early Islamic potters initially developed 
                  their skills from the techniques of their ancestors, but as 
                  long-distance trade and contacts flourished, along the Silk 
                  Roads and by other routes, they adopted many Chinese techniques 
                  to achieve a superior product, and added others of their own. 
                  Many Islamic inventions - tin-glazed earthenware, luster and 
                  underglaze painting - were in turn crucial to the development 
                  of ceramics of other cultures.</p>
                <p>Deck discovered that 
                  the brilliant color in Islamic ceramics is due to a base coating 
                  of white alkaline slip containing tin oxide. The decoration, 
                  done in enamel colors, is covered with a transparent glaze, 
                  and produces glowing, translucent effects. After much trial 
                  and error, Deck succeeded in rivaling the vivid palette of colors 
                  characteristic of Islamic ceramics. He created "bleu de Deck," 
                  his famous deep-turquoise blue glaze, using potash, carbonate 
                  of soda and chalk.</p>
                <p>As interested in 
                  decoration as in technique, Deck found prototypes for his "Persian" 
                  fa&#239;ence (called "Rhodian" in the 19th century) in ceramics 
                  that were in fact Turkish, specifically from the famous Iznik 
                  manufactory in the 16th and 17th centuries. At the time, Iznik 
                  ceramics were celebrated throughout the Islamic world for the 
                  astonishing depth, brilliance and luminosity of their glazes 
                  and colors; they were often boldly decorated with floral motifs 
                  whose stylized forms resembled those found on Persian carpets. 
                  They recalled the Islamic love of gardens, with charming tendrils, 
                  leaves, blossoms and fruits -pomegranate, carnation and tulip 
                  - swaying gracefully across the surfaces of dishes, vases and 
                  tiles. Sprightly animals and highly decorative Arabic calligraphy 
                  also flickered across their lustrous surfaces, and Iznik ceramists 
                  formed beguiling arabesque patterns with flattened leaves, limbs 
                  and letters.</p>
                <p>Deck sometimes copied 
                  directly from Iznik ceramics, but he also created variations, 
                  assimilating motifs from several examples into a single object. 
                  While Deck's designs are generally more symmetrical than those 
                  of his prototypes, it is nevertheless sometimes possible to 
                  identify the very pieces that inspired him.</p>
                <p>Islamic source material 
                  for Deck to study was hard to come by in 19th-century France. 
                  A small but steadily increasing stream of hardy European adventurers 
                  braved the perils of contemporary travel to experience the wonders 
                  of Turkey, Persia and North Africa. Back home, their exotic 
                  souvenirs perforce became touchstones of Islamic culture and 
                  sparked the European imagination.</p>
                <p>One of the first 
                  artist-travelers to the region, Jules-Robert Auguste (1789-1850), 
                  returned to Paris with curios and artifacts of every description, 
                  selected from dozens of bazaars and merchants. At his frequent 
                  "at homes," Auguste displayed costumes, carpets, weapons, ceramics 
                  and glass in a dazzling Thousand-and-One-Nights setting to his 
                  spellbound artist friends, including Th&#233;odore G&#233;ricault, 
                  painter of "The Raft of the <i>Medusa" -</i> Horace Vernet, 
                  who was to produce the battle paintings at Versailles; and Eug&#232;ne 
                  Delacroix, greatest of the French romantic painters. Auguste's 
                  souvenirs often found their way into his guests' paintings as 
                  props, and Orientalist subjects - on the increase in the annual 
                  paintings salons - now took on an air of verisimilitude, at 
                  least as far as artifacts were concerned.</p>
                <p><img src="images/deck/islamic_style1.jpg" width="246" height="167" align="left">Serious 
                  collections of Islamic artifacts began to be assembled in Europe. 
                  Nineteenth-century museums took a didactic approach to acquisitions, 
                  and avidly collected study materials for public instruction 
                  as well as to provide inspirational models to further the applied 
                  arts. The extensive medieval and Renaissance collections of 
                  Paris's Mus&#233;e de Thermes - H&#244;tel de Cluny, opened 
                  to the public in 1844, provided Deck with Islamic models to 
                  emulate, and he recorded that its collection contained 132 examples 
                  of "Persian" ceramics.</p>
                <p>Some Islamic artifacts 
                  had also filtered into France during the Crusades, and fragile 
                  survivors, along with a handful of fine examples of ceramics, 
                  metalwork and glass acquired over the years, had found their 
                  way into the French royal collections. These collections formed 
                  the basis of those of the Louvre Museum, another resource for 
                  19th-century craftsmen.</p>
                <p>Deck most frequently 
                  referred to the collection of the National Porcelain Museum 
                  at S&#232;vres, outside Paris. Open to the public since 1824, 
                  this specialized museum continually added to its large and important 
                  study collection of ceramics from around the world. Underscoring 
                  its avowed mission to provide models for industry, the museum 
                  complex even featured an applied arts school. It was here that 
                  lustrous Islamic glazes gave up their secrets and the sparkling 
                  enamel colors of exquisitely depicted Middle Eastern flora and 
                  fauna seduced Joseph-Th&#233;odore Deck.</p>
                <p>In the same pedagogical 
                  spirit as the museums, private collectors lent objects to public 
                  exhibitions. On several occasions throughout the 1860's, privately-owned 
                  Islamic works of art were displayed through the auspices of 
                  the newly formed (1864) and commercially-minded Union Centrale 
                  des Beaux-Arts Appliqu&#233;s&#160;&#224;&#160;l'Ilndustrie, 
                  the forerunner of Paris's Mus&#233;e des Arts-Decoratifs. Important 
                  collectors of the period included Baron Alphonse de Rothschild 
                  and Charles Schefer, Emperor Napoleon III's Arabic interpreter.</p>
                <p><img src="images/deck/islamic_style1b.jpg" width="247" height="167" align="left">Ironically, 
                  source material was also supplied by Deck's competition. Ceramist 
                  Eug&#232;ne-Victor Collinot and his collaborator Adalbert de 
                  Beaumont, who had first encouraged Deck to look to Islamic prototypes, 
                  joined Deck in his early exploration of Islamic ceramics. In 
                  1859, Collinot and Beaumont, themselves collectors of Islamic 
                  artifacts, published <i>Recueil de dessins pour l'art et l'industrie 
                  (A Collection of Designs for Art and Industry),</i> which contained 
                  detailed illustrations of Islamic ceramics and glass seen in 
                  their travels.</p>
                <p>This influential 
                  design book revealed the arts of the Islamic world as a new 
                  source of inspiration to a receptive and enthusiastic audience 
                  of French artists and craftsmen. In its pages Deck found a 13th-century 
                  enamel and gilt glass mosque lamp from Cairo - part of the Rothschild 
                  collection - lavishly decorated with ornament and calligraphy. 
                  Deck translated the bulbous lamp with its wide-flaring neck 
                  into a pair of ceramic vases, replacing its calligraphy with 
                  more floral ornament. Likewise, he converted a medieval Syrian 
                  glass vase illustrated in the <i>Recueil</i> into a ceramic 
                  vase alive with flora and fauna of Persian inspiration. Glazed 
                  in white, black, red and cobalt, the vase's swelling, attenuated 
                  form is enlivened with acanthus, tiny gazelles and bold interlaced 
                  arabesque patterns.</p>
                <p>In 1863, Collinot 
                  and Beaumont founded their own fa&#239;ence factory specializing 
                  in Islamic-inspired wares. Located in the Bois de Boulogne, 
                  the factory caused a sensation with its decoration of blue and 
                  white Islamic dishes. The competition with Deck was truly on.</p>
                <p>Nineteenth-century 
                  industrial exhibitions invited such competition. Heavily attended 
                  and the subject of intensive commentary and discussion they 
                  were the manifestation of an era of unprecedented official sponsorship 
                  of the applied arts. Held almost annually, they provided a forum 
                  for exhibitors to present to the public their best and newest, 
                  achievments in the name of progress. His experiments having 
                  come to fruition, Deck presented his first "Persian" fa&#239;ence 
                  at Paris&#8217;s 1861 Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie. 
                  His efforts were rewarded with a silver medal and much critical 
                  praise for his "fine quality" and "intensity of tones."</p>
                <p>Deck also met with 
                  success the following year when he introduced metallic luster 
                  glazes, derived from Hispano-Moresque, or Andalusian, wares, 
                  at London's 1862 International Exhibition. While these vitreous, 
                  iridescent glazes were first popularized in Syria and Persia, 
                  they became inextricably linked with Spanish ceramic centers 
                  such as Malaga and Valencia. Arabic inscriptions and floral 
                  and figural motifs predominated within an elaborate overall 
                  design scheme. Deck's prize-winning example was a monumental 
                  vase copied from a model found in the Alhambra, the splendid 
                  14th- and 15th-century Moorish palace in Granada (See <i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196703/">Aramco 
                  World,</a></i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196703/"> 
                  May-June 1967</a>). The vase's ornate designs were provided 
                  by Baron Davillier, a renowned scholar of Hispano-Moresque ware 
                  and a frequent advisor both to Deck and to the National Porcelain 
                  Museum at S&#232;vres.</p>
                <p>The London exhibition 
                  brought Deck important official recognition: The recently established 
                  South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum), 
                  an active patron of the applied arts, bought three of Deck's 
                  works from the exhibition. Here also, Deck's brilliant colors 
                  caused widespread comment, especially the "bleu de Deck." Its 
                  "dazzling hues seemed like electric sparks," according to one 
                  source.</p>
                <p><img src="images/deck/plate_deck.jpg" width="253" height="248" align="left">Then 
                  in 1863, the first year of their factory's operation, Collinot 
                  and Beaumont exhibited their own "Persian fa&#239;ence" at the 
                  Union Centrale, where their work, like Deck's, was awarded a 
                  first-class medal. Both factories competed again at the Paris 
                  1867 Exposition Universelle and were awarded silver medals. 
                  While critical comparison was inevitable, it was uncharitable 
                  of Deck to snipe that Collinot's "Persian wares were improperly 
                  and unauthentically decorated."</p>
                <p>Islamic art also 
                  provided contemporary French glass artists with a new source 
                  of inspiration. Philippe-Joseph Brocard began, his career as 
                  France's first art glass-maker by reviving the tedious process 
                  used to make Islamic enameled and gilded glass of the 13th and 
                  14th centuries. Brocard, who first exhibited his work at the 
                  Paris 1867 Exposition Universelle, developed a cloisonn&#233;&#160;technique, 
                  outlining his designs in thick cells of gold or enamel paint. 
                  He shared many of Deck's sources-plates from Collinot and Beaumont's 
                  <i>Recueil,</i> Egyptian and Syrian mosque lamps and beakers 
                  in the Cluny Museum, and works of art that were part of various 
                  private collections.</p>
                <p>Like Deck, too, Brocard's 
                  design repertory consisted largely of floral and geometric ornament 
                  and Arabic calligraphy. But he could not read Arabic and his 
                  calligraphy, understandably, often contained errors. It thus 
                  had only a decorative function on his glassware, lacking the 
                  intellectual or didactic element that Arabic calligraphy usually 
                  contributes to art objects of Middle Eastern provenance.</p>
                <p>Brocard in turn introduced 
                  Emile&#160;Gall&#233; to the enameled glass of Islam. Better 
                  known today for his turn-of-the-century art-nouveau glass, Gall&#233;'s 
                  early work of about 1880 frequently borrowed motifs from Indo-Persian 
                  miniatures and Islamic calligraphy. But instead of arduously 
                  trying to copy Arabic inscriptions which he too could not read, 
                  Gall&#233; simply invented a fantastic Islamicate French-language 
                  alphabet with which he inscribed mottoes on his glass in bright 
                  colors.</p>
                <p>Deck explored other 
                  cultures later in his career. In 1884, he exhibited flamb&#233; 
                  glazes in imitation of Chinese <i>sang de boeuf.</i> Deck's 
                  celadon glaze, used over designs incised in the body of the 
                  ceramic, also referred to Chinese origins, as did his many experiments 
                  with porcelain and with decorative craquelure effects. The asymmetrical 
                  designs and motifs of Japanese ceramics that were exhibited 
                  at Paris's 1878 Exposition Universelle were promptly reflected 
                  in Deck's offerings in the 1880 Union Centrale exhibition. No 
                  less exotic, Venice's glittering Byzantine mosaics inspired 
                  Deck to develop an underglaze gold to be used for background.</p>
                <p>Because of his range 
                  of technical innovations and accomplishments, Deck was made 
                  art director of the S&#232;vres manufactory in 1887, the first 
                  ceramist to assume this prestigious post. In the same year, 
                  he published an exhaustive treatise called <i>La Fa&#239;ence.</i> 
                  Half-historical, half-technical, it testified to Deck's debt 
                  to the potters of Islam. Deck continued to develop and improve 
                  the ceramic art at S&#232;vres, while his brother Xavier was 
                  charged with running the Paris workshop. After his untimely 
                  death only four years later, Deck was buried in Montparnasse 
                  Cemetery, beneath a tomb Xavier had appropriately decorated 
                  with floral ornament in colored fa&#239;ence.</p>
                <p>Deck's influence 
                  spread through the many artists and sculptors who worked in 
                  his studio or in collaboration with him. In the 1878 exposition, 
                  Deck exhibited wall plates with designs by, among others, ceramist 
                  Albert Anker, painter Henri Joseph Harpignies and caricaturist 
                  and lithographer Ferdinand Bracquemond, who popularized the 
                  <i>Japonisme</i> movement in French art. Even celebrated society 
                  painter Paul C&#233;sar Helleu once designed plates for the 
                  workshop.</p>
                <p>But it was Deck himself 
                  who began the ceramic revolution. He was the first to explore 
                  historical styles in the name of progress in ceramics - a process 
                  that continues today (See <i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199003/">Aramco 
                  World,</a></i><a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199003/"> 
                  May-June 1990</a>). Increasingly, a concern for the values and 
                  techniques of handicraft began to make itself felt in all the 
                  applied arts in his day, and that concern also continues to 
                  have repercussions in our own time. At the height of the industrial 
                  revolution, Deck returned to the artisanal tradition, laying 
                  the ground for the widespread art pottery movement of the next 
                  two generations. By the 1890's, that movement was widespread 
                  in Europe and the United States, and it had become commonplace 
                  to look to non-European prototypes for inspiration in technique 
                  and decoration. With Deck's vindication of the value of historical 
                  survivals, his work marked the beginning of a new era in fa&#239;ence.<br />
