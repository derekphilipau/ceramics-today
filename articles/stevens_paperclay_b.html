                  <P align="left">Photographic Imprints</P>
                  <P align="left">Initial trials of imprinting the porcelain body 
                    with ceramic stamps were effective. The clay held the imprint 
                    crisply and I was encouraged to think that a photographic 
                    image would be possible if the right type of ‘stamp’ (plate) 
                    could be found. I had used solar etching plates to produce 
                    photographic etchings in printmaking and thought it might 
                    be possible to use such a plate to imprint the clay. Unfortunately, 
                    the solar plate was unsuitable for this process because the 
                    light sensitive emulsion on the plate was unable to maintain 
                    the sustained contact with the clay body necessary to imprint 
                    it. The emulsion absorbed moisture from the clay body, expanded 
                    and separated from the backing plate. The resilience of the 
                    high cellulose content in the body also prevented it from 
                    being able to hold the fine imprint to any degree that would 
                    produce an effective image.</P>
                  <P align="left"><img src="../images/stevens_paperclay4.jpg" alt="Rolling Paperclay" width="238" height="195" hspace="5" align="left">In 
                    a photographic exhibition of work by Jenny Pollack and Louis 
                    Vidal, entitled ‘Passages’, (Customs House Sydney, November 
                    2000) I saw embossed photocopies of photographs that had been 
                    produced to make a tactile, readable surface for people with 
                    impaired vision. These photocopies are produced with a special 
                    heat-sensitive paper which when passed through a PIAF machine 
                    reacts to raise the areas printed with ink to give a kind 
                    of Braille photocopy. With the help of Michael Keighery at 
                    the University of Western Sydney, Milperra, I was able to 
                    produce a photographic 3D image. By using a printing press, 
                    I imprinted this image into a standard clay body and the imprint 
                    was sharp and readable. When I repeated the process with the 
                    porcelain paperclay the resilience of the cellulose once again 
                    reduced the clarity of the image. I discovered that by allowing 
                    the paperclay mix to age (at least one month), this resilience 
                    was reduced and the readability of the image improved, but 
                    the results read more as a silhouette than a photographic 
                    image.</P>
                  <P align="left">An article in Ceramic Review May/June 2001 presented 
                    research by Helen Smith at the University of the West of England 
                    on the potential of using flexography to emboss paperclay 
                    with a photographic image.</P>
                  <P align="left">Further inquires within the printing industry 
                    led me to a du Pont product named Cyrel&reg;. This proved 
                    to be just what I was searching for. Cyrel&reg; is a flexible 
                    vinyl plate of approximately 10 mm thickness to which a photographic 
                    image can be transferred by placing a photographic transparency 
                    on the plate and exposing it to intense UV light. The process 
                    duplicates even the minutest detail and the resulting stamp-like 
                    plate will effectively imprint the porcelain paperclay.</P>
                  <P align="left">I roll the clay to a similar thickness to the 
                    Cyrel plate, spray the top of the slab with a fine mist of 
                    water and smooth the surface with a plastic ruler. I then 
                    leave it to a dry leatherhard state and use a rolling pin 
                    to imprint the clay with the plate. By drying the imprinted 
                    slab slowly over a few days I avoid any warping. The slab 
                    is then fired slowly on a flat even bed of white silica sand 
                    in an electric kiln to cone 8. </P>
                  <P align="left">The fired porcelain paperclay is porous and 
                    fragile. As Steve Harrison suggests, it can be painted with 
                    acrylic medium to give it strength and flexibility and the 
                    medium gives the surface an almost imperceptible lustre. Early 
                    results have been most encouraging, to my mind opening up 
                    enormous possibilities for future development.</P>
                  <P align="left">3D Forms</P>
                  <P align="left">In my initial attempts to produce three-dimensional 
                    forms, I experimented with various construction and firing 
                    techniques and although the paperclay was effective at the 
                    construction stage, immense care had to be taken during drying 
                    to avoid warping. I found the most effective construction 
                    technique was to work with leather hard or even totally dry 
                    slabs that had been cut to the desired shape with a sharp 
                    blade and to join them with a slightly drier than normal paper 
                    porcelain slip. It was also possible to roll partially dried 
                    slabs into cylindrical forms. However, during firing, even 
                    with meticulously built supports, the forms warped slightly 
                    and although in some cases this was acceptable, it was too 
                    ‘organic’ for the type of form I wished to produce at this 
                    point.</P>
                  <P align="left">For my purposes, I overcame this weakness by 
                    constructing the forms after firing. In the first instance 
                    where I wanted to convey a sense of precariousness and tension, 
                    and the fragility of sanctuary, I layered the sheets to create 
                    the 3D form. In another piece that addresses the effort that 
                    must go into the construction of sanctuary, I perforated the 
                    edges of the sheets and sewed them together. The results have 
                    been rewarding, to my mind embodying all the fragility and 
                    vulnerability I had hoped to convey.</P>
                  <P align="left">Porcelain paperclay while challenging traditional 
                    methods of production, has presented possibilities for my 
                    studio practice. The edges possible with this body, its translucency 
                    and affinity for light, and its seeming fragility are qualities 
                    I intend to investigate further.</P>
                  <P align="left">Because of the health hazards associated with 
                    ceramic fibre and dry paper pulp, it is essential to use a 
                    facemask and gloves while mixing this body. Mix the clay in 
                    an area with sufficient ventilation and when touching the 
                    ceramic fibre, cover as much of your body as possible with 
                    protective clothing.</P>
