              with the times.<br>
              Article by Alexandra Alter</b> </p>
            <p>Originally published in the <b><a href="http://www.nepalitimes.com/">Nepali 
              Times</a></b>. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/feats_of_clay_wedging_sm.jpg" alt="wedging clay" width="150" height="229" align="left">Everyday 
              since he was a pint-sized 12-year-old, Tulisi Bahadur Prajapati 
              <font size="-2">(ed. note: in the Newari language the surname means 
              'potter')</font> has collected clay and kneaded it with his feet. 
              It's tiring, but nothing compared with what follows. Thimi's Prajapati 
              potter community doesn't use the elegant little wheels most of us 
              picture potters working with. They use old tyres filled with concrete 
              that weigh more than 300 kg <font size="-2">(ed. note - probably 
              only up to 100 kg)</font>. Starting the wheels is so laborious, 
              it is the only aspect of pot-making that Thimi's women don't participate 
              in. The men turn these improvised wheels with a pole at a frenzied 
              pace until the tyre is spinning fast enough for them to throw two 
              or three pots in about five minutes. &#8220;It's incredible that 
              the pots are so symmetrical. They're thrown so quickly and the tyre 
              is so unstable and unpredictable,&#8221; says Ani Kastan, an American 
              potter who studied potting methods in Thimi. Larger pots, such as 
              the deodas used to store chhang, are first built up out of clay 
              coils and then beaten smooth with a paddle.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/feats_of_clay1.jpg" width="200" height="268" align="right">After 
              the pots are completed they are dried in the sun, then fired in 
              communal, makeshift kilns, that are built and destroyed every four 
              days. Pots from each workshop are taken to the town square, where 
              they are stacked up, covered with straw and ash, and then burned 
              in a kind of smoke firing. Smoke and ash billow through the town's 
              streets. Not surprisingly many Thimi residents have chronic lung 
              problems. When the fire subsides and the ash is swept away, the 
              pots are left to cool. It's common for over fifty percent of the 
              pots to be destroyed during the firing process. Those that survive 
              the firing are carried around to different villages in yokes and 
              are sold door-to-door. &#8220;My father used to walk all the way 
              from Thimi to Swoyambhu selling his pots,&#8221; Santa Kumar Prajapati 
              remembers. Today some potters have resorted to vehicles, but many 
              still sell their wares by travelling on foot. </p>
            <p align="left">Tulisi Bahadur, now in his seventies, may have entered 
              the family trade at the age of 12, but claims he learnt the art 
              of pottery at a much younger age. Like many of Thimi's children, 
              he began making pots as a toddler, playing with clay and imitating 
              his father. Today, he and his wife Chinimaya maintain his father's 
              pottery workshop on the first floor of their house, where they spend 
              long hours throwing pots. </p>
            <p align="left">But of their four children, only their daughter has 
              chosen to follow the family trade. Their three sons have moved to 
              Kathmandu to work as tailors and in knitting factories. Even their 
              daughter now works in her husband's workshop, leaving the couple 
              with no one to bequeath their studio to. &#8220;I had hoped that 
              all my children would become potters, but I didn't want to interfere 
              with their wishes,&#8221; says Tulisi Bahadur.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/feats_of_clay2.jpg" width="250" height="245" border="0" align="right">Nearly 
              all of Thimi's inhabitants, who belong to the Newar Prajapati caste 
              of potters, say their trade extends far back in their bloodlines. 
              But of the estimated 8,000 Prajapatis who live in the area surrounding 
              Thimi, only 2,000 claim that profession today. The others, like 
              Bahadur Prajapati's sons, have sought more lucrative work in Kathmandu 
              as bus drivers, waiters, or factory workers, leaving many family 
              pottery workshops without an heir. </p>
            <p align="left">The high rate of defection from the potter trade is 
              disconcerting, but by no means surprising. Potters all over Nepal 
              work extremely hard for little economic compensation. Most of the 
              potters in Thimi adhere to the arduous traditional methods in which 
              every aspect of pottery production is completed manually - from 
              mixing and drying the clay to powering the wheel. Of the roughly 
              1,000 workshops in Thimi, only four or five use modern potting technology 
              such as electrically powered wheels and kerosene-fuelled kilns. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">Since they don't have enough land to grow their own 
              food, many potters walk to farms when rice and wheat are being harvested, 
              trading storage pots for grain. They make just enough profit to 
              survive on. &#8220;I go to Kathmandu to sell pots when I run out 
              of money,&#8221; explains Tulisi Bahadur. But even that is a challenge 
              today. Few Nepalis are interested in earthenware pots when they 
              can buy cheaper, longer-lasting mass-produced kitchenware made of 
              steel or plastic.</p>
            <p align="left">With such impediments to their livelihood, it's no 
              wonder that so many of Thimi's potters have forsaken their ancestral 
              vocation. &#8220;Pottery is a very difficult profession now. It's 
              hard work for little money,&#8221; says Santa Kumar Prajapati, who 
              owns Thimi Ceramics. Santa Kumar and his brother Laxmi Kumar realised 
              early on that the obstacles facing the Valley's potters in producing 
              and marketing their wares would only increase, and so in 1985 founded 
              Thimi Ceramics, one of the town's first modern workshops. Moving 
              with the times has allowed Santa Kumar and Laxmi Kumar to be innovative 
              - and remarkably productive. In addition to electric wheels and 
              pugging machines to mix clay, the brothers own one of few kerosene-fuelled 
              kilns in the area, which can fire up to 3,000 pieces of glazed ceramics 
              at a time. Unlike the unpredictable straw kilns used by most of 
              Thimi's potters, the temperature in the brick kiln is adjustable, 
              allowing the ceramics to first be fired at a low temperature and 
              then refired at 1,000 degrees after they have been glazed. The double-firing 
              technique melts the glaze and ensures that the ceramics are durable. 
              &#8220;Nepalis don't want to pay for handmade pots that break easily. 
              Potters need to find new methods,&#8221; believes Santa Kumar.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/feats_of_clay3.jpg" width="463" height="230"></p>
            <p align="left">Retaining traditional procedures isn't always a bad 
              thing - as a tourist attraction at the Bhaktapur potters' square, 
              it is a definite plus. But Thimi's potters have a lot more incentive 
              to alter their archaic techniques - few tourists visit Thimi, and 
              those who do aren't likely to lug home an enormous water storage 
              vessel. But as Santa and Laxmi Kumar have discovered, traditional 
              and modern potting methods can be blended to yield a product as 
              aesthetically pleasing as it is practical. Combining classical designs 
              with modern glaze technology, the Kumar brothers constantly create 
              new models of tableware, garden ceramics, and decorative pieces 
              that quickly get snapped up by hotels, restaurants, and foreigners. 
              Their work is found at Hotel Yak &amp; Yeti, Koto restaurant, and 
              Hotel Kido, and colourfully glazed coffee mugs from Thimi Ceramics 
              appear to be a staple in any expat's kitchen.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/feats_of_clay5.jpg" width="160" height="230" align="left">Bolstered 
              by the success of their own workshop, Santa Kumar and Laxmi Kumar 
              decided to bring other potters in the area up to speed. There have 
              been attempts to modernise Thimi's potting techniques in the past, 
              most notably by <a href="http://www.jandjtrips.com/"><b>Jim Danish</b></a>, 
              an American potter who lived in Thimi for nine years to teach more 
              expedient potting methods. Danish's most significant contribution 
              to modern Nepali ceramics was glaze technology, which he taught 
              Thimi's potters in 1980. More than just an aesthetic touch, glazing 
              serves important practical functions, making ceramics more durable 
              and hygienic. The red terracotta clay that Thimi potters use is 
              extremely porous, making it unsafe as kitchenware. Food and liquids 
              easily seep into the clay and remain there as fodder for bacteria. 
              Glazing provides a protective shield, and strangely enough, was 
              unknown in the Valley before Danish introduced it. </p>
            <p align="left">In 1984, Danish founded the Ceramics Production Project, 
              a German-sponsored organisation that provided training workshops 
              and sold raw materials relatively cheaply. Ten years later, however, 
              the project was bought up by the private sector and discontinued 
              the sale of materials to local potters. That's when Santa Kumar 
              and Laxmi Kumar started their own collective, the Nepal Ceramics 
              Co-operative Society, which now supplies materials for 14 pottery 
              workshops and 37 potters from Thimi and Bhaktapur. &#8220;You can't 
              get all ingredients for the glaze in Kathmandu. For flint, feldspar, 
              potash, quartz, and chromium oxide we have to go to India. We go 
              once a year and get enough materials for everyone in the collective,&#8221; 
              says Santa Kumar. The ingredients necessary for glazing would be 
              prohibitively expensive, as well as difficult for most potters to 
              obtain, but through the collective they can procure these materials 
              at a reasonable cost. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/feats_of_clay4.jpg" width="250" height="171" align="right">In 
              addition to providing the chemicals and minerals necessary for glaze, 
              the collective offers workshops for potters who want to learn new 
              techniques. Three months ago, a Swiss expert came to teach a new 
              glaze method at the collective. Though Nepal's ceramics are still 
              fathoms behind the rest of the world in most respects, the glazed 
              pottery produced here is technically superior to ceramics in Europe, 
              China, India, and America - it is lead-free and non-toxic.</p>
            <p align="left">Even today, Nepal's ceramic work has been eclipsed 
              by products from India and China, both of which can mass-produce 
              more durable stoneware. Kathmandu Valley potters have until now 
              been limited to the brittle red terracotta clay locally available 
              and found under the topsoil of rice fields. But members of the collective 
              are developing ways to introduce stoneware clay to pottery workshops 
              here. The research is expensive and requires imported Indian equipment. 
              Even the kerosene kiln operated by Santa Kumar and Laxmi Kumar is 
              unsuitable for stoneware firing, which requires a minimum temperature 
              of 1,280 degrees. At such a high temperature, the brick kiln would 
              melt, resulting in a huge gas explosion. At the collective, however, 
              a small high fire kiln has been constructed and is being used to 
              experiment with stoneware clay and new glazes.</p>
            <p align="left">If the research at the collective is successful, there 
              is hope that domestically produced pottery will one day supplant 
              foreign merchandise in the ceramic market. But Nepal's potters have 
              a long way to go before they'll be equipped to compete with Indian 
              imports. &#8220;To rival India, we need to be able to produce longer 
              lasting stoneware ceramics. We'll have to replace all our equipment, 
              and that's expensive,&#8221; says Santa Kumar. Such an undertaking 
              will require substantial capital investment and time, but for the 
              moment, the technical advances being made in workshops in Thimi 
              and Bhaktapur signal that a movement to reinvigorate Nepal's ceramic 
              work is underway. If nothing else, the Nepal Ceramics Cooperative 
              society is working to ensure that Kathmandu Valley's pottery tradition 
              won't decline further.</p>
