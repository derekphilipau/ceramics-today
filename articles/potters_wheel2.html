            <P >The earliest records of the potter's trade and in particular the 
              development of the wheel can be seen in the records and pictures 
              made by the Egyptians from about 2500 BC. down to Roman times. Below 
              are scenes which illustrate the essentials of the potters craft 
              in ancient Egypt. These line drawings are based on wall paintings 
              in Egyptian tombs. Click on the thumbnail image for a larger version.

              invention of a simple wooden turntable probably occurred before 
              3000 BC. Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings, during the next 2000 years 
              or more, depict potters at work using a number of different versions 
              of turntables made from wood and stone. 
            <P ><A href="images/history_of_wheel/pw01cols.gif" ><img SRC="images/history_of_wheel/pw01colth.gif" WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=100 ALT="" BORDER="0"  ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>

              These drawings show in more detail the structure of turntables which 
              were devised. Both types of turntable appear in early Egyptian wall-paintings. 
              By this time pottery vessels could now be coiled and smoothed very 
              evenly; and made quite quickly.</P>
            <P ><A href="images/history_of_wheel/ch201atms.gif" ><img SRC="images/history_of_wheel/ch201th.gif" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=50 ALT="" BORDER="0" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>The 
              little limestone statuette of an ancient Egyptian potter was made 
              about 2000 BC. It helps us to see how the potter's wheel evolved 
              from a simple turntable pulled round with the hand. The technique 
              was at first just a faster method of coiling. Village potters still 
              use this method in some parts of the world. 
            <P > The earliest turntables were probably not very free-turning, 
              but gradually potters learned how to make the shaft/pivot/bearings 
              with less friction, and much heavier turntables. Both improvements 
              increased the speed, momentum and power of the wheel. Eventually 
              it would become possible for a faster and heavier turntable/potter's 
              wheel to be used for &quot;throwing&quot; a pot. </P>
            <H3 >With a Wheel - New Shapes And Decoration</H3>
            <P > The appearance of stemmed clay goblets and pottery decoration 
              with smooth spirals and true circles are evidence of the use of 
              the potters wheel. 
            <P > <A href="images/history_of_wheel/ch178tts.gif" > <img SRC="images/history_of_wheel/ch178th.gif" width="41" height="50" alt="" border="0" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>The 
              Goblet: this shape consists of two separate forms - a bowl and a 
              stem. It is quite possible to coil a dish or bowl with a stem in 
              clay without using a wheel, but the whole form will have a somewhat 
              irregular quality. <BR clear=all>

              fact potters only began making bowls with stems when the wheel arrived. 
              - A variety of smooth regular curved shapes can be made quickly 
              and easily using a potters wheel. When leather hard the pieces can 
              be joined together with slip. <BR clear=all>

              A much later example from Cyprus in the 7th century BC. This terracotta 
              flask was thrown in three parts, joined together and then brush 
              painted with slip on a wheel - circular lines, bands and spirals.<BR clear=all>

            <H3 >The Fast Coiling Method Flourished</H3>
            <P >Strangely, the technique of making a pot changed only gradually 
              over the centuries, even though the pottery wheel improved quite 
              rapidly. Most pots were still made by coiling but the faster wheel 
              enabled much larger coils to be blended together faster and gradually 
              squashed and smoothed into a thin even wall using fingers and ribs. 
              This "Fast Coiling" method is still common in many village potteries 
              of the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Asia even today. The &quot;throwing&quot; 
              technique never fully developed in many cultures. Potters used the 
              wheel for faster smoother coiling, often using soft but enormously 
              thick coils. Enormous storage jars were made by coiling and we can 
              still find village potters today working this way in Western Asia 
              and the Eastern Mediterranean.</P>

              a 20th century Turkish potter adds a coil to a pot he is making 
              on a wheel. He turns the heavy flywheel slowly with his foot whilst 
              gradually lowering the thick coil of clay off his shoulder onto 
              the stiff wall of the partly built pot. </P>
            <P > Most village potters in Crete continue to made pots essentially 
              by coiling on a wheel. Here are two photographs of Cretan potters.<br>

            <P >In the second photo the potter has thinned and smoothed out the

              of bone for smoothing. After allowing the soft wall to dry a little 
              and stiffen up, the next coil would be added and the process repeated.<BR clear=all>

              From the Eastern Mediterranean world into Europe the potters wheel

              from 16th century Italy.<br clear=all>

              century French potters using sturdy fast wheels, but very similar 
              in design to the previous 16th century ones.<br>
              Until the continuous power-driven wheel arrived, the throwing technique 
              was possible only with a low friction, fast, heavy momentum wheel. 
              Where such smoother running heavy wheels were devised the technique 
              of 'throwing' did gradually develop. "Throwing" seems a puzzling 
              use of the modern English word, but it derives from the Old English 
              or Saxon term "to twist".</P>
            <H3 >The Cyclical Throwing Technique </H3>
            <P >Throwing with this type of wheel is cyclical. The potter kicks 
              the heavy flywheel until it is revolving quite fast then works on 
              the lump of fairly soft clay. As the speed of the wheel drops, it 
              become more difficult to work on the clay. So the potter stops throwing 
              and kicks the flywheel up to speed again. This cyclical process 
              is repeated until the work is finished. The lump of clay used is 
              relatively soft, and slurry, rather than water, is used for lubrication. 
              A large apron of some sort is needed for protection as usually there 
              is no tray! A large sheet of soft leather was used as well in later 
              workshops. Compare the last two illustrations.<BR clear=all>

              main difference between the 16ht and the 19th century wheels is 
              in the materials used to make them. Like the 16th century Italian 
              wheel, the model on the left is mostly made of wood with a strip 
              of greased leather used as an upper bearing and a metal point and

              the 19th century French example, later versions from more recent 
              times would use a thick iron or steel rod and greased metal bearings. 
              The most recent models models run very smoothly and have very little 
              friction and are almost silent. Until the industrial revolution 
              in 18-19th century Europe the potter's wheel hardly changed. Many 
              individual potters today still prefer this silent cyclical momentum 
              kick wheel to the modern variable speed electric wheel.</P>

              the Indian continent to the Far Eastern World a distinctive variation 
              of the potter's wheel developed. The heavy flywheel itself was often 
              the throwing table. Sometimes as shown here balanced on a fine point 
              with the weight carefully distributed. Instead of kicking the wheel 
              it was speeded up using a rod or stick.

              In China and Japan it is was usual for the potter to sit at or near 
              ground level, not on a raised seat as in the West. Sometimes, controlling 
              the speed of the wheel was the job of an assistant. <BR clear=all>

            <H3 >Trying out the technique</H3>
            <P >For anyone today who has only used an electric wheel, throwing 
              on a traditional momentum wheel is a new and unnerving experience. 
              It is however easy to understand and can become addictive.<br>
            <ul>
              The process is cyclical:<br>
              <li>The wheel or flywheel is turned or kicked until moving fast 
                enough to throw or centre. </li>
              <li>A fairly soft clay ball is then centred and opened out. Gradually 
                friction will cause the wheel to slow down. At some point you 
                stop throwing. Only you can decide when the speed becomes too 
                slow. </li>
              <li>The wheel has then to be kicked or turned until it is up to 
                a fast speed once again.</li>
              <li>This cyclical process (kicking then throwing) is repeated until 
                the pot is finished.</li>
              <li>Slurry rather than water lubricates the pot.</li>

            <UL>
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">The Potters Wheel, as we understand it today, 
                was not suddenly invented. The first steps were probably using 
                a shallow dish, bowl or even a large shell for building a coiled 
                pot. This technique probably dates back to perhaps 4000 BC. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">The invention of a simple wooden turntable probably 
                occurred before 3000 BC. Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings depict 
                potters using turntables made from wood and stone. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">The earliest turntables were probably not very 
                free-turning and could only be used for easier coiling. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">When the pottery turntable/wheel was being developed 
                in Southern Iraq during the 4th millennia BC. production increased 
                rapidly. Pottery making became a full-time occupation. Men became 
                the potters. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">Small turntables became larger. A smoother running 
                shaft with a heavier throwing head or large flywheel and bearings 
                with less friction progressively improved the speed and power 
                of the wheel. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1"> A potter's assistant could turn the wheel around 
                or a low flywheel could be slowly kicked by the potter. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">Strangely, the technique of making a pot changed 
                only gradually. The "Fast Coiling" method using a wheel is still 
                common in many village potteries of the Mediterranean, the Middle 
                East and Asia even today. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">"Throwing" derives from the Old Saxon term "to 
                twist". </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">Until the 18th century the throwing technique 
                was only possible with a low friction, fast, heavy wheel, called 
                a momentum potters wheel until the 18th century when mechanical 
                power wheels began to be developed. </font> 
              <LI><FONT SIZE="-1">The throwing technique using a momentum wheel 
                in cyclical (kick then throw; repeat). By contrast a mechanical/electrical 
                power wheel can usually run at a continuous steady speed or varying 
                speeds controlled by a foot pedal. </font>
