      <p><font size="2"> </font>lashing colors 
        are typical of woodfiring, usually where a reduced atmosphere has been 
        use in the higher temperature ranges, followed by an oxidised cooling. 
        The flashing colors are very dependent on the nature of the clays used, 
        and generally low iron clay bodies fluxed by felspars produce an orange 
        coloured flash.</p>
      <p>I have for many years been working at improving color response in woodfiring, 
        both in glazes and on the clay itself. Rather than dull browns and tans 
        I want reds, pinks, oranges and apricot colors. Experimenting for many 
        years with clay body composition led to RSF, a woodfire/salt body sold 
        commercially in Australia by <a href="http://www.clayworksaustralia.com"><b>Clayworks</b></a>. 
        RSF is one of the few specially formulated commercially available woodfire 
        clay bodies in the world (the others being in Japan, e.g. Shigaraki clay). 
        It has proved over the years to be very durable in the most testing woodfire 
        conditions such as anagama firing, and even refiring multiple times, a 
        practice that destroys most stoneware bodies. It has been successfully 
        fired up to Cone 12-13 in the anagama but is best around Cone 10 for color 
        development. Under the right firing conditions, RSF could produce strong 
        pink/apricot/orange colours underneath wads, or where the clay was sheltered 
        from direct flame. </p>
      <p><img src="../images/owen_rye.jpg" width="133" height="204" align="left">Recently, 
        because one of the materials in RSF became unavailable, the opportunity 
        arose to experiment with further improvements in RSF. The new composition 
        allows an even richer flashing quality.</p>
      <p>In common with the earlier version of RSF, the new clay is also suitable 
        for saltglazing. It has good throwing characteristics and is especially 
        suitable for large pots, which I make by the coil and throw method. It 
        is also used as a handbuilding body especially for large-scale work. I 
        use it sometimes as <a href="022497.html"><b>paperclay</b></a>, mixing
        shredded newspaper and some paper pulp into the commercial body in a clay 
        mixer. This does not alter its firing characteristics in any way but allows 
        making difficult shapes, and larger forms are much lighter than when made 
        from the standard RSF.</p>
