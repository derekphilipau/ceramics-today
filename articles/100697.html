<H3>Ceramic Institutions -- Part I: North America</H3>

<P>Dateline: 10/06/97

<IMG align=left SRC="../images/c_gills.gif" alt="C">eramic schools, colleges and university departments are the womb of most of our future ceramic artists and thus inhabit a special place in the ceramics community. Often these institutions and their ceramic departments have access to online resources, and their web site are a good place to get a glimpse of what young and emerging ceramic artists are up to, and where current trends lie and new traditions are emerging.
<P>
Perhaps the best known of the university ceramics departments is the <A HREF="http://apple.sdsu.edu/ceramicsweb/ceramicsweb.html"><B>SDSU Ceramics Web</B></A>, formerly the San Diego State University Ceramics Gopher. The Ceramics Web features information on classes, a materials database, potters' homepages and much more.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~muck"><B>Missouri University Clay Klub</B></A>, also dubbed 'muck', is run by the ceramics department at the University of Missouri and features a <A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~muck/gallery.html"><B>visiting artist gallery</B></A>, with works by Linda Arbuckle, Rudi Autio, Jon Wilson and many more.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://nyscc.alfred.edu"><B>New York State College of Ceramics</B></A> at the Alfred University incorporates the Alfred University <A HREF="http://nyscc.alfred.edu/mus/mus.html"><B>International Museum of Ceramic Art</B></A>, which houses many great works by national and international artists. Selected workds are available for viewing here.

There are many insitutions on the web that are not featured prominently in search engines. If you know of any such sites with works by students, staff or others, please <A HREF="MAILTO:ceramics@ceramicstoday.com.com"><B>email me</B></A> and I can include them here!
