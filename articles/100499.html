<H3>Making a Simple Plaster Mold</H3>

<IMG align=left SRC="../images/p_gills.gif" alt="P" width="42" height="52">laster molds are used
in ceramics to pour multiples of a single object with liquid
clay (slip).
Making a mold can be a daunting task, depending on its complexity.
Mold making is a highly skilled and highly payed job, e.g. with
large ceramics companies like Rosenthal or Royal Doulton. On
the other hand, anyone can learn the basics of simple plaster
mold making.
<p>


Materials required:

<ol>

<li>A bag of high quality modelling plaster
<li>Some low quality, recycled clay (to be discarded later)
<li>4 wooden boards, 20 x 30 cms ( 8 x 12 inches) or roughly
3 times the width of your bowl shape
<li>eight nails
<li>A thrown and turned, leatherhard, solid tea bowl shape (without
handles or other undercuts)
<li>bucket
<li>water
</ol>
<p>

The first step in making your mold is to put together a recepticle
for the plaster. This we will make by nailing the four boards
together to make a bottomless box. The edges should not be flush,
but actually sticking out. Make sure you don't nail them together
too well, as  you will be taking them apart later.
Once the boards are nailed together, place them on a smooth surface,
like a table-top, and wedge clay sausages into all overlapping
seams. Make sure none are left out, as this will stop any plaster
seepage. Now place your bowl shape flat side down into the center
of the box. Push it down a little so that it sticks (moisten
if necessary). Mark the height of the foot of the bowl with a
marker pen on one of  the inside boards. Mark a second line at
about 50% higher.

<p>

Now you are ready to mix the plaster. Follow the instructions
for plaster mixing on the bag. Make sure you don't breath in
any plaster dust, as this can be health hazardous. Use a mask
if necessary. Thoroughly mix the plaster in the bucket with your
hands to get rid of any lumps. (Some peope may prefer to use
rubber gloves for this, as the plaster is alkaline and may irritate
the skin). You should have a minimum of 10-15 minutes for this,
before the plaster starts to set. After this period, (but before
setting), pour the plaster over the cup shape, right up to the
second mark. Excess plaster can be left in the bucket to harden.
This can be knocked out later.

<p>

Let the plaster harden for at least a couple of hours, better
overnight. Then, using a hammer, carefully knock the boards apart.
You now have a plaster mold with a positive form sticking inside.
The clay bowl form will shrink on drying and then easily pop
out - voila! you have a plaster mold for making multiple tea
bowls, either by <A HREF="101899.html"><B>slipcasting</B></A> or press molding.
