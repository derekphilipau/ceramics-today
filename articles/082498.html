        Cook is a painter, ceramist and cyberceramist, based in Southern California. 
        <img src="../images/judith3.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">She 
        originally trained as a painter, but has moved on to add ceramics to her 
        repertoire. She studied at the Heatherly School of Art, London, England, 
        Southern Connecticut State University, New Haven, Connecticut and did 
        her MFA at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona in 1987. <img src="../images/judith2.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5"> 
        Judith's <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/mfa.html"><b>MFA Work</b></a>
        utilised ceramics and mixed media, a trend that seems to be encouraged 
        in many art schools teaching ceramics. Her <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/early.html"><b>Early
        Ceramics</b></a> where organic pod forms, glazed in white or black. These 
        have a certain elegance about them,that is underlined by the monochromatic 
        surface treatment. Between 1993 and 1995, Judith worked a series of <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/figures.html"><b>Figure
        Portraits</b></a> and from 1995 to 1996, a series of <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/heads.html"><b>Head
        Portraits</b></a>. These series are reminiscent of the series method usually 
        seems to work in, not to mention a kinship with the type of work. </p>
      <p> <img src="../images/judith1.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">It 
        is interesting to note that neither her <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/painting.html"><b>painting</b></a>
        nor her early ceramic or the MFA work indicate the direction Judith was 
        to take at a later stage. Coming into contact with computers, Judith embarked 
        on a cyberceramic project which was to span several years culminating 
        in a solo exhibition in California. The project <a href="http://www.helloworld.com.au/jcook/cyber.html"><b>Not
        the Last Supper</b></a> spans the years 1996-1998 and consists of 13 place 
        settings made using ceramic techniques combined with computer technology. 
        Judith says of her work: &quot;I work back and forth between two-dimensional 
        and three-dimensional formats often incorporating painted elements in 
        a<img src="../images/judith4.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"> 
        direct dialogue with sculptural forms. Many times found objects dictate 
        the content or are incorporated into the format of the piece. I often 
        incorporate two-dimensional mixed media with clay in a conceptual approach 
        where, symbolically, as with my use of color, I choose other materials 
        or objects where they more specifically convey my ideas. I collect a lot 
        of stuff. Stuff is equivocal to junk. Junk makes history. History makes 
        art.&quot;
