            <p align="left"><img src="images/rossman1.jpg" alt="Sculptural Vessel by Carol Rossman" width="251" height="242" align="left">'It 
              is the pot that tells me what I want to do' states Carol Rossman 
              when asked for the origins of her complex burnished and glazed raku 
              work. Rossman's reputation is founded on the accuracy of her geometry-based 
              patterns and the control of a superb range of colour in the notoriously 
              uncontrollable technique of raku. Repeat patterns to paisleys, art 
              deco to aboriginal, her designs reflect a myriad of sources that 
              she orchestrates into her own particular voice. When pushed further 
              about her work she states that she looks for the contrasts to guide 
              her &shy; soft to hard, straight to curved, voluptuous to angled 
              &shy; these things speak to her. </p>
            <p align="left">Rossman chooses her plate, bowl and vessel forms with 
              little or no extraneous detail, from a vocabulary of simple classically 
              shaped forms she has developed over her 20-year career. The forms 
              are thrown with a white raku clay body that was developed by fellow 
              Canadian, Michael Sheba. From the beginning Rossman knows where 
              the design will be placed inside, outside or on both surfaces. Her 
              designs require a smooth skin, so she trims her leatherhard pots 
              and then slightly burnishes them with a rubber or metal rib. When 
              there is no interior decoration on the piece she will leave throwing 
              rings on the inside only as a reminder of the artist's touch. A 
              rich shiny black surface is used to set off her designs and when 
              the pots are bone dry, half strength terra sigillata is applied 
              with a large brush. Experimentation was required before the right 
              thickness was achieved. Burnishing is then applied to the terra 
              sigillata until the surface feels smooth like satin. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/rossman2.jpg" alt="Carol Rossman at work" width="143" height="444" align="left">Rossman 
              finds that burnishing with plastic credit cards or plastic-coated 
              playing cards producse the best surface results. When completely 
              dry, the pots are bisqued fired to cone 08. She studies the bisqued 
              pot and decides intuitively whether the design will be freeform 
              or repeat pattern, and how many repeats are necessary. A design 
              can be lightly sketched in on a section of the white bisque ware 
              with an ordinary pencil, while corrections are made with a technical 
              eraser. For ease of correction Rossman suggests not to erase along 
              the line but across the pencil line to prevent rubbing the graphite 
              into the surface. When the basic repeat of the pattern is satisfactory, 
              a protractor is used to divide the pot into equally spaced sections. 
              For designs on the interior, sections are marked from the centre 
              to the rim; for the exterior, the rim to the base. To ensure accuracy 
              in the repeats it is necessary to draw straight lines over the curving 
              surfaces of the pots. Rossman attaches ordinary masking tape and 
              then draws her guidelines with a lead pencil. </p>
            <p align="left">All areas that will not be glazed on the pots must 
              now be masked with tape. Rossman uses black Chartpak Crepe tape 
              to create her designs. She settled on this product because the tape 
              stretches making it easy to follow the complex curves that so often 
              make up her designs. This product also comes in a wide variety of 
              widths so that several line widths, from fine to thick can be used 
              in any one design. At first only one section of the design is taped. 
              As the tape is black, this allows Rossman an opportunity to see 
              the effect of the design on the form, the tape representing the 
              areas of smoke and the white, the glazed portion. </p>
            <p align="left">Any improvements in the balance of pattern can be 
              easily corrected at this time. With the design sections already 
              established, the remaining pattern repeats are taped. While the 
              repeats look exact, Rossman eyeballs the design while she tapes 
              each section. This gives a subtle variation to the piece and keeps 
              the design from appearing mechanical. The rim is rarely glazed so 
              it and the bottom of the pot are the last areas taped. To simplify 
              the glazing process and to save tape on pieces where there are large 
              areas of undecorated clay, these areas can be masked with plastic 
              wrap such as recycled dry cleaning bags. After the final layer of 
              glaze is applied, all the tape is removed with the aid of dental 
              tools and tweezers. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Glazing </b></p>
            <p align="left">The process of glazing begins with Rossman studying 
              the taped piece to see if there are areas on the pot that she wants 
              to highlight with different glazes or subtle colour changes created 
              by oxides. Rossman has reduced her stable of glazes (having used 
              more than 30 different glazes over the years) down to 12 which are 
              used in combination with seven oxides. Her experimentation over 
              the years has given her the knowledge of glaze combinations so that, 
              in the end, a pot may have up to six layers of glaze and oxides 
              to create the rainbow effects that identify her work. On the bare 
              pot, areas are picked out for highlighting by painting sometimes 
              up to three layers of glaze or oxide with the appropriate sized 
              brushes. These highlighted areas may be random but more often they 
              are chosen to create a repeat pattern to give movement to the design. 
              After the final choice of how many areas are accentuated in different 
              glazes, the pots are air brushed with an even coat of glaze. Then 
              this coat may have other layers of glaze sprayed on to give the 
              surface even more movement with lively colour changes on the surface. 
              For a subtle effect used occasionally, the entire piece is lightly 
              sprayed with glaze while slowly rotating it on a banding wheel; 
              this lowers the contrast between areas. All work must now be dried 
              for at least two days before firing.</p>
            <p align="left"><b>Glaze Firing</b></p>
            <p align="left">One rule of firing that Rossman insists upon is the 
              need to raku with at least another person or two. While safety is 
              the main concern here, the social aspects of the exchange of ideas 
              are a welcome change from the solitary aspect of the studio. The 
              firings are done on an as-needed schedule though Rossman says that 
              warm dry overcast days are her favourite. She favours a brick raku 
              kiln and at home she uses a standard top-hat brick and metal drum 
              kiln fired with propane to cone 08. While firing, time is spent 
              preparing the reduction bins to her specific requirements.</p>
            <p align="left"><b>Post Firing</b></p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/rossman3.jpg" alt="Vessel by Carol Rossman" width="255" height="239" align="left">In 
              order to maximise reduction, the post-firing bins are filled with 
              sawdust to minimise the air space between the pot and the combustible 
              materials. The sawdust is levelled and then covered with one sheet 
              of newspaper to keep the sawdust from flying around during reduction. 
              On the centre of the newspaper sheet Rossman puts a piece of wood 
              at least as large as the pot bottom. Any wood will do and Rossman 
              often collects scraps from building sites. She uses a wood base 
              instead of a firebrick for the reduction it creates on the bottom 
              of the piece. Finally, the bin is lined with rolled newspaper wrapped 
              around the interior circumference. Great care is taken so that when 
              the fired pot is placed in the bin it sits only on the block of 
              wood and no newspaper comes in contact with the surface. Through 
              trial and error Rossman prefers using the Sunday New York Times 
              though she is not certain whether it is the paper or the ink that 
              makes the difference. </p>
            <p align="left">The fired pot is carefully lowered into the bin with 
              tongs on to the wooden block. The lid is not placed on the drum 
              until big healthy flames lick the <img src="images/rossman4.jpg" alt="Carol Rossman" width="180" height="180" align="left">pot. 
              The piece remains covered until the smoke has almost dissipated. 
              At this point Rossman lifts one side the lid slightly to create 
              uneven oxidation on the piece. This 'burping' of the bin is one 
              more chance to add to the variations of the surface so that when 
              one looks at the piece, every side of the pot reveals a different 
              aspect. The pot now is left to sit in the closed bin for at least 
              20 to 30 minutes until she can pick it up with gloves. The piece 
              is then left to cool to ambient temperature and shelved for two 
              to three days. Pieces are then examined for soot markings. Many 
              of Rossman's surfaces are dry or matt glazes, so the soot is removed 
              gently with a toothbrush. On the blackened inside of the pot, soot 
              can be easily removed with a dry cloth. After a final examination 
              of the surfaces, Rossman buffs the pot with a silicon-impregnated 
              sponge used to shine shoes. This final buffing brings the smoked 
              terra sigillata up to a rich black that sets off the multi-coloured 
              veils of colour. </p>
