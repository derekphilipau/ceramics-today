      <h3>Dutch ceramics of the 17th century</h3>
      <p> <img align=left src="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T">he early 17th 
        century was a time of exploration and development in Dutch ceramics. The 
        technique of <a href="042197.html"><b>majolica</b></a> (decorated earthenware
        on an opaque white tin glaze) had come from Italy as early as the beginning 
        of the 16th C to the southern Netherlands, an area which now would be 
        Belgium. From documents preserved in Antwerp it is known that the Italian 
        potter Guido de Savino of the famous Umbrian pottery center of <a href="011199.html"><b>Castel
        Durante</b></a> was working in Holland around this time. 
      <p> The beauty and popularity of Italain majolica saw it traded over much 
        of Europe and it was inevitable that the artisans who created it would 
        eventually follow to establish new centers of production. During the late 
        16th C. many of them moved north following the capture of Antwerp by the 
        Spanish and settled in various Dutch towns, including Delft. There is 
        a certain irony in this seeing as it is again a Spanish influence hastening 
        the spread of majolica, an art that had arrived centuries before in southern 
        Europe through the connections of the Spanish world to the <a href="http://www.iznik.com"><b>Moorish 
        and Islamic Middle East</b></a>, where the technique originated. In any 
        case, the development of <a href="080497.html"><b>Delftware</b></a> was
        soon to receive further impetus due to contact with another, and very 
        different tradition. 
      <p> <img src="../images/delft.jpg" alt="Dutch Maiolica" vspace=5 hspace=5 align="right"> 
        It was early in the 17th C that Chinese trade ware began to appear in 
        Holland, and its impact was immediate and profound. The trading activities 
        of the Dutch East India company were inextricably bound up with this process 
        of change, and its cargoes from <b>China, Japan and southeast Asia</b> 
        of beautiful and technically sophisticated wares were in high demand. 
        It wasn't long before Dutch potters began to copy the appearance of this 
        new work, although using the quite different technique of majolica. These 
        copies are accomplished but it is perhaps in the partial adoption and 
        mingling of decorative devices that one sees the most interesting work. 
        It also should be realized that in looking at Chinese trade ware there 
        are often several traditions evident already in the overlap and mixing 
        of decorative motifs. For example in 1600 it would have been possible 
        for an early Dutch traveler to Java to see a blue and white style dish 
        with Islamic text in this island that was a little earlier the center 
        of several great Hindu and Buddist kingdoms. This dish could well have 
        been transported there by Arab traders after being made to order far away 
        in one of the great Chinese pottery centers. When you look at ceramics, 
        there are very few truly discreet traditions, and its history is inextricably 
        linked with that of trade. 
      <p> Around 1670 the owners of the Dutch potteries realized that there was 
        a demand for not only the blue and white style wares but also for more 
        colorful polychrome pottery based on Chinese kang-hsi and <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ZD6Y-HRKW/"><b>Japanese 
        Imari</b></a>. As well as Chinese influence being evident in the decoration 
        some forms were also appropriated, such as the teapot, tea caddy and gourd 
        shaped bottle, and increasing sophistication in manufacturing techniques 
        meant that some quite idiosyncratic shapes were to appear, perhaps the 
        strangest of all being vases to suit that other newly acquired passion 
        of the Dutch, tulips. However, the most typical object that came to be 
        associated with Delft ceramics is one that is the least reliant on its 
        form to fulfill any function at all save that of being a vehicle to carry 
        decoration - the tile. 
      <p> In no other European country did ceramic tile pictures (as opposed to 
        mosaics) assume the importance they did in the Netherlands and they were 
        made in great quantities, not only in Delft but in Amsterdam, Utrecht, 
        Rotterdam and elsewhere. They were used to decorate corridors, cellars 
        and hearths singly, in panels or long lines. Interestingly the polychrome 
        tile came into existence in Holland very early, around 1600, and was followed 
        later by the more typical blue and white Delft designs, in a record of 
        development opposite to that found in functional wares. This may be because 
        of the presence and knowledge of the great traditions of Islamic tiles 
        and their use in mosques in <a href="http://www.ascer.es"><b>Spain</b></a> 
        and Portugal where the local tradition of decorated tiles were known as 
        <a href="032299.html"><b>Azulejos</b></a>. Certainly the patterning of
        many of these early polychrome tiles borrowed extensively from Islamic 
        designs. 
      <p> The later developments in Delft tile production saw a shift not only 
        towards the more typical blue and white style but also to an inclusion 
        of what could be termed pictures as opposed to designs. Obviously the 
        source for these images were the paintings being produced in Holland at 
        this time, in much the same way as earlier the Italian 'isatore' painters 
        of maijolica had sourced material from drawings and prints that were themselves 
        based upon paintings of that period, which in their case happened to be 
        the renaissance. And so we see pictures on Delft tiles very similar to 
        those found in 17th century Dutch paintings. Pastoral scenes, genre paintings 
        with the domestic scenes that so characterized Dutch art, still life and 
        of course maritime scenes. These pictures were often realized on tile 
        panels, as opposed to single tiles, to give broader scope to the subject.
