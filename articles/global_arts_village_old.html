                    Village</b></a> is an emerging international residential art 
                    center in New Delhi, India, which encourages diversity and

                    natural, eco-friendly environment for creative work. The Global 
                    Arts Village is a three-acre property that includes gardens, 
                    a multi-purpose studio, sculpture workshop, a meditation and 
                    performance hall, a common building, a dance studio, performance 
                    spaces and accommodations. The buildings are in accordance 
                    with the ancient wisdom of Vastu, which harmonizes man-made

                    with exploratory spirits are invited to join.<br>

                  <p> Meals are eaten together, in a common dining room or, if 
                    weather permits, outside among the gardens. We celebrate eating 
                    and great care is taken to serve delicious, well-balanced, 
                    nutritious foods. We are vegetarian at the Village, though 
                    we do consume dairy products and eggs. The food is mostly 
                    Indian, but occasionally Continental, Chinese, Italian and 
                    Mexican meals are served. India is a country with a rich tradition 
                    in vegetarianism, so the cuisine is extremely varied. We source 
                    organic vegetables, pulses, grains and oils as often as possible.</p>
                  <p>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, there is no
