      <p><font size="4"><b>A Ceramic Safari in East Africa</b></font><br>
      <p><img src="../images/safari7.jpg" width="300" height="170" align="left" hspace="4">My 
        ceramic safari continued through Ethiopia to Uganda and from there I went 
        to Kenya to work with their Ministry of Commerce, Department of Industry. 
        The legions of tourists that come to Kenya are here to see the wildlife, 
        however, not ceramics. But there is adventure in technology transfer that 
        leads into uncharted areas where appropriate technology in the high temperature 
        processes must be tried, adequately researched and documented. Further 
        areas that need appropriate research include: development of appropriate 
        mould materials as alternatives to plaster-of-paris for casting and pressing; 
        identification and winning of minerals on a micro-scale; development of 
        an appropriate glazed food storage container; and an effective low-cost 
        water filter. While having done work in each of these areas, I am also 
        developing appropriate electric test kilns and their refractories and 
        appropriate crucibles for high temperature processes. All these must be 
        made using available resources because Western-style supplies are rarely 
        available. There is some literature available on this subject and what 
        first comes to mind is Cardew's classic, Pioneer Pottery, based on his 
        own ceramic journey in Nigeria. But a more recent and comprehensive approach 
        to ceramic education and training can be found in a four-volume set of 
        books "The Self Reliant Potters Series," by Henrik Norsker and James Danisch 
        and published by GATE, the German Appropriate Technology Exchange. This 
        series offers the only information of its kind on simplified, appropriate 
        technology of ceramics. Its volumes include: Clay Materials, Refractories 
        and Kilns, Glazes, and Forming Processes. But with respect, Norsker and 
        Danisch's invaluable contribution is only the tip of the iceberg. Each 
        section of each of the four books suggests volumes of additional research. 
      </p>
      <p> Another set of books is the series "Build Your Own Metal Working Shop 
        from Scrap," by David Gingery, published in the United States by Lindsay 
        Publications. The seven volumes in this series start with a book called 
        "Build a Charcoal Foundry." The second book in the series is called "Build 
        a Metal Lathe." Again, using scrap metal, the cast parts needed for the 
        lathe can be made with the help of the charcoal foundry already built. 
        Gingery's subsequent books tell how to make a drill press, a shaper, a 
        milling machine and all the other accessories needed in a complete metal 
        fabrication shop. All these machines can be made using parts turned on 
        the lathe. The cost of the entire metal fabrication shop is negligible. 
        Through Gingery's books and those of Norsker and Danisch, the means of 
        industrialisation through ceramics and metal are adequately proven. One 
        other book on appropriate technology makes the case for small projects. 
        This is the Schumacher classic "Small is Beautiful." This book stresses 
        developing skills and traditions in various crafts and underlines the 
        problems with large scale industries. 
      <p> <i>Above: Stalls for foot-mixing brick materials will soon be replaced 
        by a mechanised mixer. This will help make possible the drier mix needed 
        for uniform bricks and proper stacking, resulting in better bricks and 
        reduced fuel consumption.</i> 
      <p><img align=Left src="../images/safari8.jpg" hspace="5" width="152" height="150"> 
        <i>Left: Low-fire ceramic drums, Dajo, Sudan.</i> 
      <p> The history of failure of large projects is understood. A brick plant 
        requires electricity for blowers but can get none. A vocational school 
        in the desert has massive machines but neither teachers nor students. 
        But there still exists an impetus to create and fund these white elephants. 
        The allure of a quick fix is irresistible, and the subsequent news of 
        failure is easily squelched. There is a lack of commitment by donors, 
        contractors and beneficiaries, starting with a feeling that no one really 
        owns the project. 
      <p> So what can we do? If you want to help bring ceramics and micro-enterprise 
        to developing countries, start by telling people that teapots are beautiful, 
        but there is a whole lot more to ceramics. Inform donors and politicians 
        just how vital ceramics is in the development process. Tell them that 
        education and training are the only key inputs and that in developing 
        countries, all other resources are locally available. Let them know that 
        ceramic manufacturers' products make possible a wide variety of other 
        micro-scale industries and that your country's development assistance 
        should be applied to such projects. Get together with other ceramists 
        you know and find ways of assisting ceramists in developing countries. 
      <p> The goal of this safari is to give individuals a decent and productive 
        livelihood through micro-enterprise and help them to stem environmental 
        degradation at the same time.
