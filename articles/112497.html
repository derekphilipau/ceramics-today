<H3>Functional Pottery in Australia</H3>

<P>Dateline: 11/24/97 
<P>

<IMG align=left SRC="../images/a_gills.gif" alt="A">ustralian pottery is said to have a characteristic of its own - an influence of the red earth, the 'gum' (eukalypt) trees, the hot sun and other colors and flavors of the Australian landscape. Some potters have even developed 'uniquely Australian' glazes.
<P>
One such potter is Brian Moore. At his <A HREF="http://www1.tpgi.com.au/users/bmoore/"><B>Inglewood Hill Pottery</B></A> he has developed a range of functional porcelain work from the 'humble' coffee mug to platters and jugs. These are decorated with 'Australian' glazes with names such as 'Outback or Desert', 'Broken Hill Blue', 'Broken Hill
  Green', 'Midnight Blue', and 'Evening Jacaranda'. 
<B>Greg Daly</B> is another well known Australian artist who has been experimenting with glazes for many years and has developed his own unique style. His wheel thrown stoneware and porcelain vessels serve as the carrier for the varied surface treatment he achieves with layered glazes in conjunction with lustres, gold and silver leaf, enamels and etching.

<!--<A HREF="http://www.healey.com.au/~lemarts/lucy.html"><B>Lucy Mudbiri</B></A> is a ceramic artist originally born in Peru and now living in Australia. Her work is strongly influenced by her South American background, eg. in her Peruvian Motifs work, however she also loves using other motifs such as wonderfully painted colorful fish.-->
<A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~smithl/"><B>Leonard and Lucy Rose Smith</B></A> are two potters working in Arcadia (!) in New South Wales. Leonard works with stoneware and fires his large vessels in a gas kiln with wood-ash glazes. Lucy Rose uses high-fired porcelain, her decoration is much more floral than that of Leonards.
<P> Woodfiring seems to be a passion in Australia. Perhaps it is the open and 
  secluded spaces that just offer the oportunity to build and fire a large wood 
  kiln, without having to worry about neighbors. This may even be more so with 
  salt and soda firing. <A HREF="http://www.haecceityarts.com.au/gn.html"><B>Gail 
  Nichols</B></A> pottery is soda glazed and functional none-the-less. Her Portfolio 
  of Soda Glaze Ceramics gives a good overview of her varied work, which ranges 
  from wheel thrown platters to vases. Another traditional firing technique is 
  that of pit firing, which Barry Hayes has brought to perfection. Barry has been 
  working with that technique for many years, but also makes more functional stoneware 
  vessels and pots.
