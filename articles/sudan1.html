              article by Reid Harvey 
            <p> In Swahili, the Lingua Franca of East Africa, the word 'safari' 
              means journey. For the past two years I have been on a safari with 
              East African ceramists: an adventure in technology transfer. The 
              journey started with a year in the Sudan, working with a Women in 
              Development (WID) Project for the United Nations. It has continued 
              with ceramists in Kenya. Several side trips to Ethiopia, Uganda 
              and Eritrea led to ceramic opportunities and environmental issues. 
              As the journey started, it was 47° C in the shade, a hot dry wind 
              burned, stirring up a dust storm, called a 'haboob' in Arabic. More 
              than once we saw bright daylight plunged into utter darkness by 
              these haboobs. Sudan's dry season lasts 10 months without a drop 
              of rain. With the desert here advancing at the rate of seven kilometers 
              per year, one wonders if ceramics is viable. Enter technology transfer. 
            <p> When first arriving in western Sudan, I noticed near our vocational 
              school in El Obeid, a number of wood burning clamp kilns. But our 
              WID project aimed at training women for extra income generation 
              in various ceramic techniques, starting with hand building tableware. 
              Unfortunately, lack of resources and support cut this project short. 
              My 26 students worked for four months and acquired basic ceramic 
              skills, but it is doubtful that any of these daughters of the desert 
              had been able to pick up the design and marketing skills needed 
              to continue working. 
            <p> <img align=left src="../images/safari2.jpg" width="105" height="484" hspace="8"><i>Left: 
              The half-built, vertical tunnel kiln of the Building and Road Research 
              Institute of Khartoum University.</i> 
            <p> On the outskirts of Khartoum, 600 million bricks are produced 
              annually. As in much of Africa, building materials are in short 
              supply and will be produced at any environmental cost. In an insidious 
              crisis, countless bricks are being poorly formed, then under-fired 
              in inefficient wood burning clamp kilns. These poor quality bricks 
              are produced not only around Khartoum but throughout Sudan and Africa. 
            <p> It was hard for me to concentrate when talking to brick makers 
              and builders. I wanted to suggest: Try adobe, try stabilized earth 
              blocks. But habits die hard. Consumers with a little money want 
              their bricks fired. Formed with soft mud, they quickly lose their 
              shape and because of this, they cannot be properly stacked in the 
              kiln and must be piled close together. Heating is by conduction, 
              not convection, resulting in the bricks being nearly raw. Often, 
              when driving home, I would deliberately run over bricks that had 
              dropped from a transport truck on to the road. My curiosity as to 
              quality always got the same answer: the bricks would crumble to 
              dust. 
            <p> I felt that the public deserved a stronger, longer lasting product. 
              The most appropriate solution was to provide an energy-efficient 
              kiln and teach workers how to make a better brick. Working with 
              Khartoum University's Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI), 
              I adapted and built an Asian vertical tunnel kiln. The BRRI's kiln 
              will fire the bricks made on the production line of the brick plant 
              which they own and operate. The fuel will be carbonized agricultural-waste 
              and is made in a similar way that charcoal is prepared from wood 
              but, importantly, it is made from cotton stalks, sunflower stalks 
              or bagasse. These carbonized fuels, reduced to a granular size, 
              are dispersed among the bricks when loading the kiln from the top. 
              Every hour the brick is lowered by one batch, using a chain pulley 
              system. 
            <p> The vertical tunnel kiln is energy efficient because incoming 
              bricks at the top of the kiln are preheated using the waste heat 
              of its central firing zone. Secondly, the brick stack is well insulated. 
              This system has been a success in Asia for more than 20 years. By 
              comparison, other types of brick kilns - the clamp, Hoffman and 
              bull's trench kilns - waste energy in preheating both their brick 
              and their outer insulation. Hoffman kilns are massive - looking 
              down from the top, the firing follows a circuit around the kiln's 
              oval shape. Clamp kilns are just a pile of bricks with an opening 
              underneath for the fuel. Often the clamp has no permanent walls 
              - mud is dabbed all around to help prevent leaks. The bull's trench 
              is a hole in the ground in which fuel and brick are stacked then 
              fired. Designed to yield a batch of 180 bricks every hour, the vertical 
              tunnel kiln will produce nearly 1.5 million bricks annually. It 
              is fired continuously for 11 months of the year, allowing for a 
              month of maintenance. When production greater than 1.5 million is 
              needed, more kilns can be built. The total cost of the BRRI's vertical 
              tunnel kiln is about US$3000. Ironically, this cost is so low that 
              many aid donors will not consider funding it, nor will many banks 
              lend money.
