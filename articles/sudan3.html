              article by Reid Harvey
            <p align="left">The work of the department head at Sudan University, 
              Professor Salih El Zakir, has adhered to a meticulously executed 
              Arabic style. One quite successful alumnus is Yasir Mohammed. Yasir's 
              elaborately formed pieces are most often unglazed. Large sculptural 
              vessels are slipcast, with a clay body having no deflocculent. The 
              plaster used for molds is of a low quality typical in much of Africa 
              but the addition of 4 percent portland cement helps to give the 
              molds strength.<br>

            <p><i>Left: At the Khorobhagarat kiln, a brick making team at work. 
              These soft mud bricks quickly lose their shape.</i> 
            <p> Across the White Nile from Khartoum, in neighbouring Omdurman, 
              another ceramic devotee is Dr Ahmed Hassan Hood. To financially 
              diversify his business making refractory brick, Dr Hood produces 
              a line of decorative planters and small ziers. As is often the case 
              in Africa, where shared information can be hard to come by, the 
              artist must attempt to be a scientist, and vice versa. Dr Hood is 
              a chemical engineer turned ceramist. Remarkably, with no prior experience 
              other than research in books, he has begun production of good quality 
              kaolin firebrick fired to 1400° C. Dr Hood's oil-burning, domed 
              brick kiln was built through trial and error, and patience. His 
              own ceramic journey has been one of pure scientific inquiry: an 
              acquired understanding of what the local materials can do. 
            <p> Near El Obeid, at Khorobhagarat, the construction of a Hoffman 
              kiln is a new project of the United Nations Development Program 
              (UNDP). Firing with heavy fuel oil, an express objective for this 
              kiln is to reduce the amount of wood fuel used for brick making 
              in the area. I gave brick forming teams at the kiln some assistance 
              in using a drier mix of clay. With this improvement, the kiln's 
              managers were able to achieve improved stacking in the kiln, resulting 
              in better firing, stronger bricks and reduced fuel consumption.

            <p> Because success in marketing is closely dependent on good technical 
              skills, in 1992 in the United States, I founded Appropriate Technology 
              Transfer in Ceramics (ATTIC). My aim was to provide services and 
              technical information to aspiring ceramists. We distributed two 
              do-it-yourself manuals. I wrote one on making models and moulds 
              and another on how to build and operate an inexpensive air-release 
              ceramic press. We also made available 25 out-of-print technical 
              papers which give the basics on various ceramic processes and materials. 
              ATTIC flourished assisting ceramists from the United States and 
              many other countries, proving that what is appropriate is needed 
              everywhere and is forever relevant. Appropriate technology is not 
              only applicable to remote villages in the heart of Africa. 
            <p> A similar body of information exists in back copies of The American 
              Ceramic Society Bulletin, also from the 1930s to the '60s but the 
              demand has not warranted reprinting. Only more recent information, 
              primarily on advanced ceramics, is being rendered to electronic 
              libraries. In the 1970s, my initial pursuit of ceramic information 
              started in Liberia, West Africa. There I worked for 11 years in 
              glass art and I dabbled in ceramics. I began to notice that Liberia 
              and neighbouring countries appeared stuck in a cycle of raw materials 
              exportation and finished goods importation. For export they could 
              mine iron, cut timber and tap rubber, but they manufactured little. 
              In Liberia, I walked every day on a path of kaolin, yet I had to 
              import firebricks for our kiln. Although Liberians and their neighbours 
              were melting and casting iron and other metals in the 19th century, 
              it seems that the metal products imported from Europe and the United 
              States supplanted local products. The metal-working industries closed 
              and craft traditions were lost. When I saw this, I decided glass 
              art was too ornamental for me and I could work in ceramics to change 
              these situations for the better.
