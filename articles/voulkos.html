                  Voulkos</a></b> touched clay, then he touched us. He journeyed 
                  through life, and work, guided by his intuition, his past experiences, 
                  and the curiosity to discover the next possibility. The 19th 
                  century realists suggested that we are products of our heredity 
                  and environment. Emile Zola proclaimed 'I am an artist. I am 
                  here to live out loud' and Peter Voulkos did. </p>
                <p>Voulkos lived a courageous life, he lived it with sincerity, 
                  passion, integrity and respect. The magnitude of his accomplishments 
                  and the revolutionary vision of his work will remain in the 
                  museums and collections throughout the world and will be studied 
                  by students indefinitely. No less important is the direct effect 
                  he has had on those who were a part of his life, the way he 
                  influenced them, and the accomplishments they have had and will 
                  continue to have. Voulkos was the father of a movement that 
                  is still in its infancy; it has only begun to be characterised. 
                  Its history continues to unfold in the works and deeds of those 
                  whom he inspired.</p>
                <p>Since 1999, I have had the opportunity to work with Voulkos. 
                  I assisted him in the construction of 16 major stacks, one of 
                  which is more than 2.1 m (7 ft) tall. We also worked together 
                  on numerous plates as well as a monumental ice bucket titled 
                  Gaudi. Throughout this involvement, we were together for nearly 
                  six months, from morning until night. I was with him during 
                  his last days, and it is from this perspective that I write 
                  about this legendary man and his creative process. </p>
                <p>My first encounter with Peter Voulkos' work was in 1984. I 
                  was delivering work for one of my teachers from the Kansas City 
                  Art Institute, to a Chicago art gallery. On exhibit was a Voulkos 
                  piece called Two Brick Stack. I slept next to it for three nights. 
                  I traced every line, texture, movement and moment of that remarkable 
                  piece. This was my first art experience; the first time I realised 
                  the power of sculpture. I asked myself, What kind of man could 
                  and would make this piece? Eighteen years later, and I am still 
                  finding out. </p>
                <p>I met Voulkos in his home in the early '90s, subsequently 
                  firing three stacks and several plates in my Denver anagama, 
                  meeting and corresponding occasionally. During this same period 
                  of time, I was also fortunate to develop a friendship with another 
                  artist, Jun Kaneko and, in late 1998 a phone call from Jun changed 
                  my life. He called to tell me that he was inviting Peter Voulkos 
                  to his Omaha, Nebraska, studio to make some new work and did 
                  I know anyone that would be able to assist him. I immediately 
                  answered yes &shy; me. I suggested that we do a workshop together 
                  in Ohio, where I was teaching at Bowling Green State University, 
                  in order to see if we would work well together. The Bowling 
                  Green workshop took place in 1999 and the project in Omaha took 
                  place the following summer at Kaneko's studio. </p>
                <p>For me, the chain of events was magical. Everything fitted 
                  together when we worked on a piece; we hardly needed to talk 
                  about where the piece was going. Voulkos made all of the aesthetic 
                  decisions and I tried to anticipate where he was headed. I wanted 
                  to give him whatever support I could. All of the work that we 
                  made together followed a similar procedure. We would throw a 
                  number of parts on the wheel: plates, cylinders, thick bars 
                  &shy; all raw materials for the fabrication process (a 'dance' 
                  may be a more accurate description) that ensued. </p>
                <p>I came to discover that Voulkos' creative process was quite 
                  different than had been previously described by art historians. 
                  For instance, writers have tended to overemphasise the aggressive 
                  hack and slash, take no prisoners approach to his work. Violence 
                  and machismo were not a part of what I saw in the work or the 
                  man. When Voulkos touched the clay there was no ego, only courage. 
                  His knowledge of the material was complete; he knew how to work 
                  with and through it. I noticed that when we were working together, 
                  it became a series of movements that took place through a kind 
                  of protracted moment in time. It was a much slower dance than 
                  one might guess. As Voulkos initially began to touch the clay, 
                  he also began to improvise, responding to the moment, conscious 
                  of the past but always moving forward. I cannot remember him 
                  ever second-guessing himself &shy; he would move over every 
                  area of the piece with care and vigilance, constantly tuned 
                  in to what was happening with the clay. Over the course of a 
                  work session, he would come to a point of saturation. It seemed 
                  that the clay and his body always needed a break at the same 
                  time. </p>
                <p>After working, when his mind had time to digest it all, he 
                  would begin to think about where the piece might go tomorrow. 
                  Often, he would tell me in the morning over coffee that he had 
                  been dreaming about the piece all night, saying &sup3;I know 
                  what I am going to do with that neck.&sup2; After a day of work 
                  at Jun Kaneko's studio, we would go up to our apartment, 
                  make a couple of Bloody Marys and watch the video of what we 
                  had made that day. It was like he was a coach reviewing a game 
                  film &shy; only much funnier. During the video he would see 
                  things that he couldn't see while in the middle of making 
                  the piece. It was fascinating to him (and to me) to see the 
                  way the eye of the camera was able to capture different information 
                  than he was, seeing it all at the same time. </p>
