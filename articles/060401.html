              <b>emperature Measurement and Control</b> 
            <p> Pyrometers, controllers and programmers all are invaluable tools 
              for potters, providing an indication of the actual heat in the kiln 
              and performing a range of other functions. With skill, these are 
              used to gauge efficiencies, firing rates and atmosphere control. 
            <ul>
              <li> <i>Moving coil type meters</i><br>
                These are generally available in 2 ranges suitable for potters, 
                0-1400° C and 0-1200° C. The former is the type "R" unit and must 
                use the appropriate probe and cable and the latter type "K". The 
                disadvantage of these meters is the inherent inaccuracy due to 
                parallax error and the fragility of the mechanism. </li>
              <li> <i>Electronic digital meters</i><br>
                These units have gradually replaced the moving coil type as the 
                cost of manufacture has rapidly decreased. Although not more accurate, 
                it is possible to judge a small increase in temperature precisely. 
                This is invaluable when changes are made to the atmosphere or 
                fuel flow as a neutral atmosphere is the most efficient and will 
                indicate the most rapid temperature rise. Conversely a reducing 
                atmosphere will slow down the rise and may even cause a drop. 
              </li>
              <li> <i>Temperature controllers </i><br>
                Temperature controllers are mostly digital but analogue styles 
                can still be purchased. These will control the kiln at a preset 
                temperature either soaking or to shut down the load. These can 
                be wired to soak and shut down with a timer device but generally 
                it can be more economical and offer far more flexibility if a 
                programmer is used. Controllers usually will indicate the actual 
                temperature and are useful as a safety device. Controllers must 
                be matched to the appropriate probe type although newer digital 
                units have the ability to be set for a variety of probes and outputs 
                by the operator. </li>
              <li> <i>Temperature programmers </i><br>
                Temperature programmers are available in a multitude of configurations 
                but generally with five or more stages. Each stage usually has 
                a pre-settable ramp rate or soak time allowing accurate automatic 
                control of the entire firing process. Programming can be quite 
                involved on some of the more complicated units but generally is 
                as simple as setting the temperature to reach and, in the case 
                of the up or down ramp, the rate in degrees per hour. The soak 
                stages usually have the temperature automatically preset and require 
                a time to be entered. It is possible to create a simpler single 
                ramp unit using a temperature controller, an energy regulator 
                and a timer. <br>
                Controllers or programmers are simply wired into the existing 
                contactor or control device on electric kilns but require additional 
                solenoids if connected to gas kilns. Most industrial kilns are 
                controlled with programmers and in conjunction with the electronic 
                safety units enable the kiln to be automatically started, fired 
                up and down and shut off. A more recent innovation is the atmosphere 
                controller. This permits the amount of reduction or oxidation 
                to be accurately set and maintained. The burners are usually special 
                industrial types that have a separate air supply. The cost is 
                a little prohibitive unless the turnover of work warrants the 
                extra degree of automation. </li>
              <li><i>Thermocouples And Compensating Wire</i><br>
                A thermocouple is simply the joining of two dissimilar metals 
                that produce a small voltage when heated. The temperature meters 
                display this voltage on an indicator that has been designed to 
                show this as a temperature. Most dissimilar wires will exhibit 
                an output when joined and heated but may not be at all linear 
                (or manageable). The three main types of thermocouples (or probes) 
                available to potters were chosen after intensive research and 
                exhibited the desired characteristics when heated at certain temperatures. 
                <br>
                The probes are joined to the indicators with compensating or extension 
                cable. Ideally this connection should be made completely with 
                the same thermocouple wire as the probe to minimize losses but 
                this would be far too expensive. The compensating lead is made 
                from cable that has similar attributes to the probe but is formed 
                from cheaper wire. It is important to make sure you connect the 
                thermocouple with compensating cable (not ordinary copper cable) 
                and also use the correct type for the probe. Unfortunately the 
                Americans, French, British, Japanese and Germans all have different 
                color codes for the compensating cables. It is critical that the 
                positive (plus) conductor and the negative (minus) are connected 
                to the correct terminals. Do not expect that a red will always 
                be a positive conductor. <br>
