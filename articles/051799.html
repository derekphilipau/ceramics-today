<IMG align=left SRC="../images/a_gills.gif" alt="A">ndrea Hylands is a British born ceramic artist resident in Australia. She is well known throughout the world for her bone china sculpture and vessels. Keeping in tradition with her elegant and finely crafted art work, she has created a web site of equal quality that is a joy to behold.
<P>A navigation bar at the top of the page offers us rooms in a virtual gallery, 
  more or less linking us to a new page with an 'exhibit' or one of Andrea's works, 
  e.g. 'cycolites', a work in bone china and bronze. A further navigation bar 
  at the bottom of the page gives us the opportunity to read about current exhibitions, 
  her biography, artist's statement, related articles, links page and order form.

<P> Hyland's work is very eclectic, ranging from sculptural works such as 'untitled' 
  or 'tubularis', to origami two, in the style of earlier works. 
<P> Of works such as 'cluster' Hylands says &quot;The sphere has been of specific 
  interest to me for several years. The illusive simplicity of the sphere and 
  the profusion of boundless visual associations leave it open for me to work 
  with this form in many ways&quot;. 
<P>
Andrea Hylands has over the years evolved a very distinct style, which is effectively mirrored in this enjoyable web site.
