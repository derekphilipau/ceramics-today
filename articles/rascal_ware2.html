            <p align="center"><b>Georgette Ore and Rascal Ware - Chapter 2</b></p>
            <p><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore5.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore5.jpg" width="231" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              question is still open. Some people think Rascal Ware is the artistic 
              product of a deep affection&#8230;but others believe that the better 
              word is infection. So there was some uncertainty when the staff 
              met to plan our first public exhibition. Present were Junior Bucks, 
              the owner; Mosley Bunkham, the business manager; Don Pilcher, the 
              other potter; Shakespeare, the shop dog; and yours truly.</p>
            <p>We discussed our project for hours. Junior kept repeating how important 
              this event was. Pilcher talked endlessly about all the ceramic stuff 
              he knows&#8230;emphasis on endlessly. He&#8217;s a retired professor 
              and it&#8217;s as if he thinks and speaks in fifty minute blocks 
              of time. When he comes to certain subjects, like deflocculated kaolin 
              and engobes, his speech quickens and he breaks out in perspiration 
              on his upper lip. What a load.</p>
            <p>Mosley doesn&#8217;t say much because he&#8217;s new. But when 
              he screws up he always covers with this, &#8220;The sun don&#8217;t 
              shine on the same dog&#8217;s ass every day.&#8221; That passes 
              for philosophy around here. About Shakespeare; although he has a 
              large receptive vocabulary, he doesn&#8217;t say anything either&#8230; 
              naturally. It&#8217;s too ironic. They should have named him Harpo. 
              I hate irony. </p>
            <p>That&#8217;s five males and it makes me the only woman here. Honest 
              to god, some days I look up from the wheel and all I can see are 
              bricks and dicks. This is not an easy environment since we all live 
              and work in that small, dark space between Pilcher&#8217;s ears. 
              That&#8217;s a load also.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore6.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore6.jpg" width="234" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore7.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore7.jpg" width="239" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Pilcher said we could knock this show out in three weeks. He suggested 
              one clay, two throwers (him and me), three glazes and four shapes; 
              bowls, plates, jars and vases. Yuck! He also noted that wood firing 
              was very hot right now. I&#8217;m not sure he got the pun. Sad. 
              I told him &#8220;Wood fire&#8217;s plenty fine, but not all the 
              fucking time.&#8221; It took some doing but I eventually sold them 
              on this: As a first exhibition we should do something out of Genesis&#8230;like 
              the story about the ark. So we made all the pots in pairs - two 
              of everything. We included earthenware, bone china, porcelain, lead 
              glaze, salt glaze, overglaze, underglaze, lusters, oxidation, reduction, 
              single fire, multifire, overfire. No raku&#8230;I hate raku. Junior 
              said I threw 467 pots in all. He would know.</p>
            <p><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore8.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore8.jpg" width="233" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>Which 
              brings me to the &#8220;Thrown Thrown&#8221; pair. Junior hums constantly; 
              usually the old Gershwin standard, <i>Do It Again</i>. It&#8217;s 
              ironic because he has a pretty clear case of obsessive compulsive 
              disorder. I bought him a book on OCD, which he&#8217;ll keep forever 
              but probably won&#8217;t read. In response to his humming, I thought 
              I&#8217;d double throw some pieces, first on the wheel&#8230; and 
              then on the table. Since I was hired at RW to provide the creative 
              spark, I thought the idea had some merit. And kind of funny too. 
              Junior didn&#8217;t agree and said, to my face, that these pieces 
              had exceeded anything like a creative spark and were now mired in 
              a godless trench where they could be rescued only by the ghost of 
              Peter Voulkos.</p>
            <p>I told him these pots were actually in honor of his agreeable ways 
              and the perfect propitiation of the RW motto- &#8220;We&#8217;ll 
              make anything.&#8221; Junior bought it. He sees himself as an intellectual 
              and all you have to do is wrap your argument in a six-dollar word 
              and he&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s kind of sad. But he pays on time 
              and his check is always good.</p>
            <p>In the end, what we have for you is a potter&#8217;s primer, an 
              exhibition for other potters. Our work may be easier to appreciate 
              when illuminated by a remark Shoji Hamada once made when viewing 
              a diverse group of pots, &#8220;Yes, they are all the same&#8230;all 
              different.&#8221; We find his conclusion inscrutable and improbable, 
              but amazingly potent. </p>
