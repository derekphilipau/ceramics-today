      <H3>Picolpasso and the Art of Majolica in 16th century Italy - Part One</H3>
      <p><B>Li Tre Libre Dell'Arte Del Vasaio</B>, the three books of the potters 
        art, was written in 1557, or very close to that year, by Cipriano Picolpasso. 
        It is a remarkable document, and is interesting both as a guide to the 
        methods and techniques of the production of Majolica pottery in renaissance 
        Italy, and also for the insight it gives into the attitudes and life of 
        it's author. 
      <P> <IMG SRC="../images/ppasso1.jpg" align="left"> Picolpasso was born in 
        the early 16th century in Castel Durante, a small town in Umbria and a 
        center of manufacture of Majolica ceramics. As later described in his 
        famous treatise on the topography of Umbria, Le piante it I ritratti delle 
        Citta e Terre dell'Umbria, he says, speaking of Urbino and of the virtues 
        of Castel Durante.....they bear off the highest prize, for the making 
        of pottery not only in all Italy but I believe in all the world, as I 
        hope will shortly be seen in a treatise of mine on the potters art which 
        I wrote many years ago at the request of the blessed memory of the most 
        illustrious and most revered Cardinal de Tournon, who spent a whole year 
        there during the time when the French descended into Italy. This passage 
        gives an idea not only of the importance of the manufacture of Majolica 
        ware to Castel Durante, but of the systems of patronage that operated 
        at the time, the vicissitudes of which affected Picolpasso as much as 
        anyone else. However I am not a scholar, and any examination I would attempt 
        of the structure of the society of renaissance Italy would only be a poor 
        recounting of others words. I do however recommend the introduction to 
        the three books of of the potters art by Ronald Lightbrown of the Victoria 
        and Albert Museum and Alan Caiger-Smith, a potter and expert on Majolica 
        ware, both of whom also acted as editors of this edition, as it gives 
        some insight into the world that Cipriano Picolpasso inhabited and his 
        attempts to live by the ideals of the time, and to become a renaissance 
        man. 
      <P> The aspect of this treatise I would like to examine is its uniqueness 
        as what could almost be described as the first 'how to' guide to the manufacture 
        of a quite sophisticated and certainly beautiful and highly valued ware. 
        The techniques of Majolica came to Italy through Spain, to Spain from 
        the Moors from North Africa and the Middle-East, and dates back to about 
        the ninth-century A.D. in Mesopotamia. It is, for pottery, a middle-aged 
        tradition, but one that came into existence at a time and place that saw 
        it spread with trade and colonization quite rapidly. Also to be considered 
        is the fact that it was, in the early stages, an art of the Islamic world, 
        and that world was one of considerable learning, influence and curiosity. 
        However it wasn't until 1301 that Abu'l Qasim of Kashan, a city in Persia 
        famous for its ceramics, wrote his treatise that also deals with this 
        topic. It is a much shorter document, is not illustrated, and, although 
        I have not seen a translation, is apparently a bit obscure, as the word 
        intriguing crops up fairly commonly in its description, and this suggests 
        to me that it poses more questions than it supplies answers. 
      <P> By comparison, the three books of Picolpasso are not only richly illustrated 
        but are ordered in the most satisfyingly logical way. They could, even 
        now, with a little research be used as a work-shop manual, given the one 
        constraint of working in the same areas of Umbria and Tuscany since the 
        raw-materials, with no possibility of analysis existing at the time, would 
        have to be sources from the same locations to expect comparable results. 
      <P> <B>Majolica</B><BR>
        <img src="../images/potw/castel_durante.jpg" alt="Early Maiolica dish  from Castel Durante" width="200" height="200" align="left">Majolica 
        is, by definition, low-fired ware of a decorative nature with that decoration 
        applied over a white ground, that ground being almost always a glaze specified 
        with tin oxide, a colorant which when added to a glaze will, if correctly 
        formulated enable it to cover a buff or even terra-cotta clay. The fact 
        that it is fugitive at high temperatures was not a problem as only the 
        Chinese wares of the time were achieved at anything much over 1,000 or 
        1,100 degrees centigrade, these being the upper limits to which Majolica 
        ware was fired. 
      <P> It was indeed interaction between the Islamic world and China around 
        800 to 900 A.D. that led to the development of Majolica There is a record 
        in a book written in the year 1059 that says.... All Ibn Isa, governor 
        of Khurasan, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun at Rashid, twenty pieces 
        of Chinese imperial porcelain, the like of which had never been seen before 
        at the Caliph's court, in addition to two thousand other pieces of porcelain....This 
        was presumably porcelain of the Twang period. What was admirable at the 
        time about this porcelain, apart from any other aspects, was it's whiteness, 
        and this was soon to be imitated albeit by very different means to those 
        employed in it's original manufacture. 
      <P> By Picolpasso's time Majolica had been practiced in Italy for more than 
        a hundred years, and had developed from an unpretentious craft to a level 
        of sophistication and virtuosity that it was ranked alongside skills such 
        as the making of fine jewelry. I must note at this point that tin-glazed 
        ware had existed in Italy back to at least the 11th century in Orvetio 
        and other places, but had never developed at those sites into what is 
        considered true Majolica
      <P> The development of this tradition depended above-all on the exploration 
        of drawing, color and subject matter: it was essentially painters pottery. 
        Although the technical difficulties should not be under-estimated, it 
        was, for example, possible to obtain with some reliability blues, ochres, 
        green, soft-reds, black, white and the indispensable antimony-yellow, 
        all existing on a solid white ground beneath a covering layer of clear 
        glaze. This glaze gave depth to the surface as well as providing a functional 
        durability, although the best of Majolica was, because of it's value, 
        primarily decorative rather than functional in its use, if not its form. 
      <P> <B>The Workshop</B><BR>
        In considering the objects themselves, we should look at the place where 
        those objects are produced, and a description of a typical medium sized 
        workshop of the time is given by Picolpasso. Indeed the description of 
        just such a workshop, how it functioned and produced what it did comprises 
        the bulk of his treatise.
