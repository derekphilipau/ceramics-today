<h3>Ceramics Societies</h3>
		Dateline:02/17/97<P>

The Ceramic Society plays an important role for those potters and ceramic artists that wish to congregate and share their experiences with collegues. Not only do Ceramics Societies have meetings, but might also organise events, such as the <STRONG>NCECA Conference, Rochester, NY, USA</STRONG> or the <STRONG><a href="http://online.anu.edu.au/ITA/CSA/ceramics/conference.html">8th National Ceramics Conference, Canberra, Australia</a></STRONG> or publish magazines such as the <STRONG><a href="http://www.mm.com/mnclayus/fall96.html">Minnesota Clay USA Newsletter</a></STRONG>, <STRONG><a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~potinaus/">Pottery in Australia</a></STRONG> or the German language <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~marsu/kalkspatz/tb.html">Kalkspatz T�pferblatt</A></STRONG>.<P>
Ceramics Societies offer a forum for the exchange of ideas, a possibility to keep in touch with what is going on in the ceramics community -these things are especially important for the artist that works alone at home and may feel the isolation of the 'lone artist'.<P>
Where there are potters and ceramists there are ceramics societies. The <STRONG><A HREF="http://jeeves.nist.gov/~wcraig/acers_homepage.html">ACERS - American Ceramic Society</A></STRONG> in particular has many chapters across the country -possibly one near you.
Europe is also very strongly represented with the main chapter the <STRONG>European Ceramic Society</STRONG>, but also locally through <!--the <STRONG><a href="http://www.imi.dtu.dk/DAKS/daksen.html">Danish Ceramic Society</a></STRONG>,--> the German <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~marsu/kalkspatz/">Kalkspatz T�pfernet</A></STRONG> and the <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.keram.se/sks/">Swedish Ceramic Society</A></STRONG>. Japan has its <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.ceramic.or.jp/welcome.html">Ceramic Society of Japan</A></STRONG> and Australia the <STRONG><a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~potinaus/psa.html">Potter's Society of Australia</a></STRONG>.<P>
All of these societies and their sites on the Web fulfil an important role in exchanging information and generally helping out their members and in many cases non-members with whatever needs arise -and a lot of the time the work is purely voluntary too!
