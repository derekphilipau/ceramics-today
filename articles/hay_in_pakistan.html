              of the Ceramic Design Department at the National College of Arts 
              in Pakistan, Shazia Mirza, invited paperclay pioneer <a href="http://www.grahamhay.com.au"> 
              <b>Graham Hay</b></a> to spend a month working with her staff and 
              students at their Lahore campus. 
            <p>Shazia Mirza described what happened: &#8220;When I first came 
              across Mr. Hay's work in Anne Lightwood's very valuable book &quot;Working 
              with Paper Clay and Additives&quot;, I immediately decided to get 
              in touch with him. I searched for his name on Internet, found his 
              website, which is a world in its own, and asked for his availability. 
              His response was prompt and here we are sharing very different experiences 
              from across the continents.</p>
            <p>The Artist-in-Residence program is an interactive learning experience 
              for both the students at the college and the artist in residence.</p>
            <p>We get to see the &quot;living product of a different environment&quot; 
              operate in our own system. The larger host group is effected in 
              a very positive manner, through their shared experiences and projects 
              they exchange ideas and collaborate events, conferences and research 
              which results in new creative work, and in this case we were introduced 
              to unbounded imagination with visions refreshed.</p>

            <p>It was amazing to know through his slideshows that one of his famous 
              works that actually made me invite him, got broken many times before 
              it was finally photographed, was mended back to perfection every 
              time, and was never fired, but recycled instead!</p>
            <p>So this material makes you feel so comfortable with your work. 
              Fear about losing your work seems irrelevant, less emotional attachment 
              to work helps you develop at an accelerated pace. For all of us 
              it has been an endeavour, a learning experience and a new opening 
              of possibilities in the clay world.&#8221;</p>

              Hay described how it was for him: &quot;It is always a stimulating 
              experience accepting an invitation to place myself within a different 
              environment, language and culture, with different people, clays 
              and kilns. New ideas, perspectives, directions and friendships, 
              are just some of the outcomes.</p>
            <p>It is a stimulating experience introducing a new art medium, which 
              does not have an established cannon of aesthetics or techniques, 
              to a group of bright students and staff. The experiences and work 
              challenges students, teachers, curators, and audiences. The fun 
              for audiences is trying to understand 'what happened' and to guess 
              where it will eventually lead.</p>
            <p>Paperclay, in case you haven't heard already, is processed cellulosed 
              fibre (generally beaten paper pulp) added to any clay. In some regions 
              of Australia between a third and a half of clay bought by teachers 
              is paperclay. Similar patterns are appearing around the world. And 
              for good reasons too: mechanicaly recycling clay either by hand 
              or pug mill is no longer necessary (just drop firm or dry paperclay 
              into water to soften). Small air bubbles in the clay body can be 
              ignored (the fibre acts as vents), repairs/alterations to dry work 
              can be made and final works don't always need to be fired. Works 
              can be left to dry, and resumed weeks later after soaking in water.</p>
            <p><a href="images/hay_in_india/Hay_NCA_Principal_Prof_Sajida_H_Vandal_and_NCA_International_Relations_Director_Zaffer_Iqbal_at_Opening.jpg"><img src="images/hay_in_india/thumbs/Hay_NCA_Principal_Prof_Sajida_H_Vandal_and_NCA_International_Relations_Director_Zaffer_Iqbal_at_Opening.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" align="left"></a>One 
              of the directions taken up with enthusiasm by staff and students 
              at the National College of Arts, Lahore, has been to explore the 
              unfired paperclay option. That is, make objects from paperclay, 
              dip or coat various materials with paperclay, and not fire the work. 
              In a sense art is not just imitating life, it has become a thin 
              surface skin on nature. Aside from the technical interest, this 
              metaphor for our species living off animals and plants on the thin 
              crust of this planet, is but one of many interpretation which may 
              be drawn from this work.&quot;</p>
            <p><i>The Paperclay Practice</i>, an exhibition of work created by 
              Graham Hay, NCA staff and students was held at the Zahoor ul Akhlaq 
              Art Gallery, Lahore, 8 to 22 April 2006. For more details visit
