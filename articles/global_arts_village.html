            <p align="center"> <font color="#993333" size="+1"><b>Unfortunately 
              I have received numerous bad reports about this residency. Here 
              are a few excerpts (artists' names withheld):</b></font>
            <p>&nbsp;
            <p>&quot;Myself and other artists were subject to mental bullying 
              by being excluded from the main area where we lived. We were bossed 
              around to do all kinds of menial tasks like gardening in the mid 
              day sun because westerners were spoilt and needed there ego breaking 
              down, we were told if we did not do these jobs we would be sent 
              home, despite paying to be there. There is also a sinister undertone 
              to the whole place because Ashwin, the man who runs it, is OSHO 
              and tries to impose his Osho ideas on artists who stay at the village.&quot;
            <p>&quot;I am sorry to inform you that in my opinion the GAV is a 
              racketeer. the problems have been numerous, from the rooms flooding 
              on a near constant basis without being addressed. Services advertised 
              and extra funds paid for are supplied haphazardly. There has been 
              allegations of sexual harassment on past and present residencies.It 
              appears to target young women. There were initially 5 artists all 
              commencing on 04.08.06. All artists have vacated GAV with no refund, 
              not even half way through our residencies!
            <p> I received a termination notice at 7.30pm 15.09.06 whilst in hospital 
              my baby son who traveled with me has required 2 major operations 
              during our short stay, GAV was aware of timing of 2nd operation 
              so motives appear to be premeditated and callous. There has been 
              no reason given for my termination, I had to engage to help of the 
              police to have my belongings returned. My son and I have been basically 
              rendered homeless in a foreign country no refund for my $6127 USD 
              has been returned.The place seems to be run on fear and intimidation 
              I and other artists have received veiled threats. I have managed 
              to contact previous residents and have received approx 20 emails 
              of similar horrific stories. The owner has claimed that GAV is an 
              Ashram and a spiritual place which follows the osho practice (I 
              have discovered Osho is the new name for the Rajneshi - orange people 
              cult). I am absolutely horrified that this type of treatment has 
              been rendered onto artists on an ongoing basis although complaints 
              and recommendations have been made to directly GAV in the past.
            <p> I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RECCOMMEND GAV TO ANYONE, and would suggest 
              any organization affiliated with them make further enquiries before 
              being associated with GAV. I found GAV through Res artis and Alliance. 
              Res artis have received numerous complaints along the line as mine 
              and re no longer associated with them.&quot;
            <p>&quot;After only a day I was approached by Ashwin, who asked me 
              to come to his room where he would give me a massage. An incident 
              that is not appropriate on any level to a new artist. From that 
              point on I felt very uncomfortable in my new living situation and 
              felt I must stay away from him. This pattern continued with other 
              members of the staff. I feel since I am a young girl they could 
              try and take advantage of me. On another occasion we had a &quot;welcome 
              celebration&quot; for the artists to highlight their work, I did 
              not feel that it was about our artistic endeavors whatsoever. That 
              night Sunil was talking to me and started asking me very inappropriate 
              questions. It started with just information about my family, how 
              they are, how long my parents have been together and so forth. I 
              feel he was using this information to see how much he could ask 
              me. He then proceeded to ask me if I was a virgin, something that 
              even people close to me would not dare ask, nor is it anyone's business. 
              After this uncomfortable talk I wanted to leave and go back to my 
              room, since I was the only person there and I was feeling very threatened. 
              He then gave me a hug and proceeded to kiss me, I pulled away and 
              he again started kissing me on my neck, I even said I did not feel 
              comfortable. I went to bed that night feeling terrible and mistreated 
              and in the morning I was extremely upset when thinking what happened. 
              On September 20th, another situation occurred where I had a terrible 
              headache and I asked Aruto for some medicine, he gave me some and 
              then told me that he could release the tension in my head by a simple 
              technique. Since he is a certified masseuse I trusted that it would 
              help, but when rubbing my head he pulled me close and tried to kiss 
              me, I pulled away, uncomfortable, got up and left. He apologized 
              and I just walked out. These are just my personal incidents of this 
              nature, there have also been many more situations that I feel the 
              artists have been mistreated.&quot;
            <p>&quot;The problems encountered there have been numerous and quite 
              horrific in detail. To cut a long story short all of the artists 
              including myself have left after only 5 weeks. No refund of any 
              form has been made by GAV to anyone. I have received emails from 
              other former residents stating very similar stories ranging from 
              sexual harassment to veiled threats and intimidation. I am taking 
              legal action against GAV. I think its important to prevent this 
              type of scam from happening to any further artists who have worked 
              very hard to visit India.&quot;
