      <p><b>Glazing Techniques</b><br>
      </p>
      <p><img src="../images/g_gills.gif" width="48" height="54" alt="T" align="left">lazes 
        can be applied in various ways. Some glazes must be applied in certain 
        ways and not in others. The following is a description of the most common 
        glazing techniques. 
      <p><b>Dipping</b><br>
        Dipping is probably the most common glazing technique. As the name suggests, 
        a pot or other ceramic object is dipped into a bucket of glaze. This may 
        require a large amount of glaze, depending on the size of the object. 
        If it is a thin necked vase or bowl that is being glazed, the inside may 
        be done first by pouring the glaze in and out again. Then the form is 
        dipped into the glaze with the opening facing down. The trapped air will 
        prevent any glaze entering the already glazed interior.<br>
        Hint: three-pronged raku tongs are handy for dipping -- they leave only 
        small pin-sized marks which can be smothed over by rubbing. 
      <p><b>Pouring</b><br>
        Pouring is a technique which may be used if a work is too large to dip, 
        or if there is just not enough glaze available. The ceramic object is 
        held in one hand and glaze is poured over it as evenly as possible, until 
        the whole surface is covered. With this method, overlapping is inevitable. 
        If this is an issue with the glaze used, edges may be smothed over by 
        rubbing with a finger.<br>
        Hint: do not rub glazes with unprotected fingers if they contain toxic 
        ingredients like <a href="lead.html"><b>lead</b></a>, <a href="080999.html"><b>manganese</b></a>
        or even <a href="copper_english.html"><b>copper</b></a>! (Try rubber gloves.)
      <p><b>Spraying</b><br>
        Separate equipment is required for spraying, which is not always available 
        in the studio pottery: a glaze spray gun, a compressor, a mask and a glaze 
        booth. The glaze booth extracts fine glaze mist, which should <i>not</i> 
        be inhaled from the air. This is done with an extractor fan. More sophisticated 
        spray booths have a wall of running water to trap most of the glaze, so 
        it is not just ejected into the atmosphere (important where toxic ingredients 
        are used!). Spraying may sound easy but is not necessarily. Spraying the 
        interior of a vase for example would be difficult, as the spray has little 
        room to maneuver in the small space and is ejected again quickly, possibly 
        spraying into your face. To remedy this, such vessels are first poured 
        and the exterior sprayed afterwards. The advantage to spraying is that 
        glaze cover is very even. This can be crucial with some glazes.<br>
        Hint: to check the thickness of the sprayed glaze, scratch the surface 
        with a pin. If it is of sufficient thickness, the scratch can be smoothed 
        over by rubbing. 
      <p><b>Brush-on Glazes</b><br>
        Brush-on glazes are glazes especially formulated for brushing onto ceramic 
        work. This makes decorating very easy. These glazes are formulated so 
        that brush marks will largely smooth over, but at the same time the glaze 
        won't run, if fired to the right temperature. Brushing on glazes also 
        enable variations in decoration, that would otherwise be impossible. The 
        difficulty is getting the combination of thickness and firing temperature 
        right, but this is -- as with so may things -- a matter of trial and error. 
      <p><b>General Rules</b><br>
        For health reasons, it is important that you read the <a href="toxic_materials.html"><b>general
        rules for handling toxic materials</b></a> when glazing ceramic work.<br>
