              Because of the rapid drying of dry-to-dry joins, and the strength 
              of unfired paperclay, walls cannot only be built upwards but also 
              horizontally and downwards. After building a dry rod frame, I build 
              inwards, outwards, downwards or upwards from it by rods, planes 
              or spheres. The base frame can be a single vertical sheet, a cone, 
              a cube of planes or rods, or any other form. For joining two curved 
              dry surfaces, I use plastic paperclay dipped in paperclay slip to 
              increase the contact surfaces and strength of the join. I anticipate 
              unusual forms as others also gain control over these multi-directional 
              building techniques. Wool thread or string can be soaked in paperclay 
              slip, allowed to dry completely before re-soaking it again. Three 
              or more soaking/drying cycles create a good sized rod. This is a 
              quick way to build strong straight or curved rods, rather than rolling 
              them out. They can be cut by scissors to the desired length for 
              building. Alternatively, while plastic, these string clay rods can 
              be draped over a form to dry in curving lines. More recently, I 
              have rolled out or cut slabs into tapered rods of plastic paperclay 
              which are bent into curves and spirals before drying. These can 
              be then 'spot-welded' with slip from a squeeze bottle to form supports 
              or decoration for delicate objects.

              Having used paperclay for more than four years, increasingly I find 
              myself considering sources of paper and its role in our lives. Despite 
              the promise of an electronic society, the computer has increased 
              the volume of paper we handle daily: our weekend newspaper now boasts 
              more than 432 pages of news and advertisements. Similarly, the annual 
              distribution and recycling of yellow and white phone books creates 
              a mountain of paper. Without paper, our whole administration and 
              knowledge systems would collapse. More specifically, for artists, 
              paper is essential. Apart from increasing the strength of a clay 
              body, paper underpins most artistic practices; we use it to record 
              ideas, design and record our ceramic work, as well as do our accounts 
              and correspond with customers, galleries and shops. Similarly, the 
              documentation and organisation of exhibitions involves a huge amount 
              of paper for invitations, grant applications, press releases, catalogues 
              and posters. In two dimensional art practices, such as printing 
              and painting, contemporary art simply would not exist without paper. 
              How many of us have a small home library of books and journals such 
              as Ceramics: Art and Perception? We line our homes and offices with 
              masses of paper as if we are creating paper nests or cocoons. Even 
              when recycling paper into my paperclay, I could not keep up with 
              the paper tide, so when a local paperclay became available for conventional 
              clay prices I began to create paper sculptures. After stacking the 
              paper I drilled, cut, carved, sanded and bound it. Following this 
              experience, I began to see paperclay as a solid material that we 
              can shape and refine into different forms before finally assembling 
              the dried pieces into a completed work. 
            <p> I also considered our local use of clay as a building material. 
              Because of wood-eating white ants, most of our old buildings and 
              modern houses are made from ceramic bricks. So along with the necessary 
              paperwork these brick buildings shape how architecture is organised 
              and presented. Consequently I began to make tiny paperclay bricks 
              which, when dry, I joined together into organic forms. For me, these 
              were more about creating internal spaces than external forms, that 
              is, the public and private spaces in which we and art exist. Ceramic 
              art has a number of clearly defined schools of aesthetics arising 
              from cultural influences and from the physical properties and limitations 
              of the material. Paperclay enables the artist to use traditional 
              ceramic building techniques as well as skills borrowed from elsewhere. 
              Consequently the work can mimic many of the forms created in these 
              materials. However, we already have a tradition through ceramists: 
              Henry Pimm (1980s), Richard Notkin and Adrian Saxe, who create ceramic 
              objects which imitate wood or metal objects. The fundamental difference 
              here is process rather than imitation, for paperclay enables us 
              to easily create this type of work with some expertise. If paperclay 
              removes the clay skills necessary to create these illusions, does 
              this necessarily alter the significance of these artworks and traditional 
              ceramic skill hierarchies?
