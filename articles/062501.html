            <p><a href="062501b.html"><img src="../images/lawsonOyekan1_sm.jpg" width="62" height="114" align="left" alt="Healing Being" border="0"></a>Mr.
              Oyekan, Grand Prix winner, believes that &quot;an endless question 
              and understanding will heal our wounds of experience like a streak 
              of light in the dark&quot; and that his ultimate objective was to 
              accomplish such a process through his work. His work is an impressive 
              hand-molded, terracotta structure measuring, 68cm in length and 
              width and 201cm in height, weighing 110kg. <a href="062501b.html"><b>Enlargement</b></a>.</p>
            <p>It was the jurors opinion that &quot;it's a piece that energizes 
              viewers spouting enormous strength like a volcano&quot; and that 
              &quot;it reminds them of the nature, climate and buildings of Africa 
              while simultaneously casting a mystery of weather if it was formed 
              naturally or if was it created by a human or an animal. Although 
              it seems to have been made through simple techniques, the delicacy 
              seen in the surface is a sharp contrast to its large shape emitting 
              a sense of intimacy, and a simplicity that seems to say that anyone 
              can make such work. At the same time, it gives space a strong sense 
              of &quot;existence&quot;. This monumental, multidimensional piece 
              of extraordinary quality will stimulate viewers.</p>
            <p> Interestingly, the majority of works for the category &quot;Ceramic 
              for Use; Function oriented&quot; came from Asia while the majority 
              of works for the category &quot;Ceramic as Expression; Non-function 
              oriented&quot; from the West. This would seem to throw some light 
              on the different developments in pottery and ceramic art in the 
              Orient, where tradition seems to play a greater role, and the Occident, 
              where emphasis is might be on experimentation. The statisics could 
              also be an indication that the West has more leisure for artistic 
              expression while in the East, ceramics are a greater matter of survival. 
              This is not to judge either one or the other direction, but the 
              assessment does throw open many questions as to the nature of ceramics 
              in different parts of the world.</p>
