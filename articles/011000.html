      <h3>Inside the 'New White Cube'</h3>

        the 'New White Cube' - A Journey into the World of Virtual Ceramics is 
        the transcript of a keynote speech given by Ceramics Today Guide to Ceramics 
        Steven Goldate at the '<A HREF="http://www.ceramicartswa.asn.au"><B>EDGE</B></A>' 
        - the 9th National Ceramics Conference in Perth in July 1999. Following 
        is part one of that speech. 
      <p> Over the past two thousand years the fundamentals of craft have not 
        changed. We basically form craft objects and craft products with our hands. 
        This century has seen the rise of electricity aid us in the making of 
        craft, but still its broader practice has changed little. Now at the close 
        of the 2nd millennium craft is being revolutionized by bytes and bits 
        - the art of computing. From the first self-conscious steps with Photoshop 
        to the higher sophistication of 3D imaging, VRML, animation and multimedia, 
        craft is breaking its age-old shackles of materiality and entering a new 
        dimension - the dimension of virtual craft. Craft is beginning to inhabit 
        information space. It is merging with computer technologies to create 
        a new hybrid art or craft form, informed by equal parts of the old and 
        the new. This transformation of craft will be unexpected and rejected 
        and attacked by many. The proclamation of a new <A HREF="http://member.melbpc.org.au/~sgoldate/intersect/"><B>computer 
        craft</B></A> will be seen as a sacrilege by many. But we are not inventing 
        something that does not already exist, but acknowledging tendencies already 
        well under way, giving them a name, making them easier to recognize. Those 
        who are attentive to, and do not close their eyes to the 'new technologies' 
        will see its influences already manifesting in craft: laser cutting techniques, 
        stereo lithography, mathematically influenced CAD, 3D rendering, VRML 
        craft worlds et cetera. 
      <p> Ceramics have played a significant role for mankind and have literally 
        been around for millennia. We may look towards the ancient Egyptians, 
        the Phoenicians, Assyrians or even the native peoples of the ancient Americas. 
        From the first clumps of earth accidentally fired in a campfire to the 
        first functional pit fired vessels. Little has really changed since that 
        time. We still use fire to create our pottery - in wood kilns or gas kilns. 
        The ancient techniques of <a href="../msub17.html"><B>raku</B></A> and
        pit-firings are still very popular. We form works by using our hands to 
        deform, mold and assemble the clay and throw pots on wheels. In some quarters 
        - I am told - the kick-wheel is still alive and kicking. We may now have 
        electric wheels and kilns and other gadgets, but these items don't really 
        constitute a fundamental change in, or addition to our tools and materials. 
      <p> However, I would say that things are looking a bit different now as 
        we rapidly approach the third millennium. Technology is advancing at an 
        ever-increasing speed. Today anyone can buy a computer with more processing 
        power than a 1960's mainframe computer which took up a whole office block, 
        for around $1000. In western societies at least, the computer is becoming 
        a ubiquitous tool, with a strong presence in universities, schools, libraries 
        and of course business and the workplace. Even primary school kids are 
        going to school with their own laptops. They may spend most of their time 
        playing games on them, but that will be the fertile ground on which their 
        other digital capabilities will grow. 
      <p> The possibility of purchasing great processing power at low prices has 
        had a tangible effect on the arts and crafts with more and more artists 
        working in the digital area, not to mention other applications like desktop 
        publishing, word processing, spreadsheeting etc. The computer screen lends 
        itself to the production of 2D images, which are not that far removed 
        from traditional paintings, prints or watercolors, so a fairly strong 
        arena of digital art has established itself. But Digital Craft? Virtual 
        Ceramics? Can there really be such a thing? Well, yes, some ceramic artists 
        and other craftspeople are incorporating the computer and its multitude 
        of possibilities into their work. The notion of digital craft is being 
        talked about and written about - here in Australia by such people as <A HREF="http://209.133.8.181/"><B>Kevin 
        Murray</B></A>, or in the United states by <B>Malcolm McCullough</B> or 
        <A HREF="http://blue.temple.edu/~crafts/mjcc/bios/esa_lechtzin.html"><B>Stanley 
        Lechtzin</B></A>. 
      <p> Ceramic artists are not just by creating web sites for themselves, or 
        storing their images digitally, but also manipulating their images, and 
        creating work, which at least initially exists in the virtual space of 
        the computer monitor, by using 2D software programs like Photoshop or 
        3D modeling programs like Lightwave or 3D Studio Max. The way we view 
        these types of works is usually on a screen. Actually we may not be so 
        aware of it but we are surrounded by screens: the computer screen, the 
        TV screen, the slide projection screen, the cinema screen, even the advertising 
        billboard. The computer screen itself appears to contain the images or 
        data we are looking at within its physical dimensions, although it actually 
        only displays the data which is stored somewhere else, the hard drive. 
        This virtual space of the computer monitor can be viewed as an exhibition 
        space of sorts. Of course you do get '<a href="../msub44.html"><B>virtual
        galleries</B></A>' on the Net, and the data stored on computers around 
        the world is often referred to as 'information space' - an alternative 
        type of space or reality. But the computer monitor also physically extends 
        itself into space with its external dimensions and the possibility of 
        creating 3D worlds on the screen creates an internal visual space. This 
        alternative exhibition space could be called the 'New White Cube'. That 
        other 'white cube' being of course the traditional gallery space with 
        its four neutral white walls. 
      <p> These are works, like all others, which are initially conceived in the 
        mind - a type of virtual space in itself - and then realized using computer 
        software. They are made of the stuff of the digital realm, namely bytes 
        and bits, which are basically combinations of the digits zero and one.
