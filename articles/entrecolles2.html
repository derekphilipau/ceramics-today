              Being the first detailed accounts on the manufacture of Chinese 
              porcelain to reach the Occident.
            <p>From William Burton's <em>Porcelain, It's Art and Manufacture</em>, 
              B.T. Batsford, London, 1906. 
<p>The second letter is dated from Ching-te-chen itself, on the 25th 
              of January, 1722, and we translate its essentials:</p>
            <p>However much trouble I have taken in informing myself as to the 
              way in which the Chinese make porcelain, I am far from thinking 
              that I have entirely exhausted the subject. You will see by the 
              new observations I send you that fresh researches have given me 
              fresh knowledge. These observations I will unfold to you without 
              any order, just as I have put them down on paper as I have had opportunity, 
              either in going through the workshops and instructing myself with 
              my own eyes, or by asking different questions of the Christians 
              who are occupied in the manufacture.</p>
            <p>I. As gold on porcelain wears away from time to time and loses 
              much of its lustre, it may be restored by moistening the porcelain 
              with clear water, and then rubbing the gilding with an agate, though 
              one must be careful to rub always in the same direction, say from 
              right to left.</p>
            <p>II. The edges of porcelain pieces are especially subject to chip 
              off; the Chinese strengthen them so as to obviate this inconvenience 
              by mixing with, the glaze some bamboo charcoal. They edge the porcelain 
              pieces with this mixture when they are already dry, putting them 
              on a wheel for the purpose ; afterwards they put the glaze on the 
              edge as well as on the rest of the piece, and after firing the edges 
              are just as white. As Europeans have no bamboo, I think they might 
              use in its place willow-charcoal, or still better that of elder, 
              which somewhat approaches bamboo. It must be noted that before the 
              bamboo is reduced to charcoal, the green skin is removed, because 
              they say that the ashes of this skin makes the porcelain pieces 
              burst in the oven. It should also be noted that the workmen must 
              be careful not to touch the porcelain with greasy or oily hands; 
              the place that had been touched would crack infallibly in the firing.</p>
            <p>III. Speaking of the colours, I mentioned that there are red ones 
              that are blown (souffl&eacute;), and I have explained how to make 
              this colour, but I do not remember having said that there are blue 
              souffl&eacute; pieces, which are easier to make. No doubt people 
              will have seen some of these pieces in Europe. Our workpeople agree 
              that if expense were no object, it would be possible to blow gold 
              or silver on to the porcelain, such as those that have a black or 
              blue ground, so as to produce a decoration of gold and silver rain. 
              This kind of porcelain, which would be in a new style, would surely 
              please people.<br>
              Glaze can be blown in the same way as the red colour. A little while 
              ago they made for the Emperor pieces that were so thin and fine 
              that they had to put them on cotton wool, because they had no other 
              means of handling the pieces without great risk of breaking them. 
              It was not possible to dip these pieces into the glaze, so the glaze 
              was blown on, and the pieces entirely coated in this way.<br>
              I have noticed that, in blowing the blue colour, the workpeople 
              are careful to lose as little as possible of the colour. They take 
              the precaution to place the vase on a pedestal, and under the pedestal 
              they put a large piece of paper, which can be used for some time. 
              When the colour that falls on the paper is dry it is gathered together 
              with a little brush, so that nothing is lost.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ching-te-chen.jpg" alt="Ching-te-chen 'white ware'" width="350" height="154"></p>
            <p>IV. They have recently found a fresh material fit to be used in 
              the composition of porcelain; it is a stone or a species of chalk, 
              which is called Hua-Shih, which the Chinese doctors also use to 
              make a draught, which they say is detergent, aperient, and cooling. 
              The men who work in porcelain have thought of using this stone in 
              the place of the Kao-lin spoken of in my last letter. It may be 
              that some place in Europe may be found which supplies this stone 
              Hua-Shih, even if there is no Kao-lin. It is called by this name 
              because it is somewhat glutinous, and in a way like soap.* Porcelain 
              made with Hua-Shih is rare, and is much dearer than the other. It 
              has an extremely fine grain, and with regard to the work of the 
              brush, if it be compared with ordinary porcelain, it is like vellum 
              compared with ordinary paper. Moreover, this porcelain is so light 
              as to surprise one who has been accustomed to handle other porcelains; 
              it is also much more fragile than the commoner kind, and it is difficult 
              to seize the proper moment of its firing. Some do not use Hua-Shih 
              to make the body, but content themselves with making a kind of thin 
              glue with it, into which they dip the porcelain when it is dry, 
              so that it is coated with a layer of this material before it receives 
              the colour or the glaze, and in this way they obtain a certain degree 
              of beauty. When the Hua-Shih is mined it is first washed with water 
              to clear away the yellowish clay with which it is coated, and it 
              is then prepared in the same way as Kao-lin. I am assured that porcelain 
              can be made of these substances alone without any addition, but 
              one of my converts, who has made this porcelain, tells me that he 
              mixed eight parts of Hua-Shin with two parts of Pe-tun-tse. I have 
              also been told that if they were to put more, than two parts of 
              Pe-tun-tse and eight parts of Hua-Shih, the porcelain would sink 
              in the fire because it would not be firm enough. It is five times 
              the price of Kao-lin, so that this kind of porcelain must be dearer 
              than the common kind. They can also trace designs with this material, 
              using it as a slip to paint upon the porcelain pieces, and when 
              the painting is dry the pieces are glazed. After firing, the designs 
              are of a whiteness different to that of the porcelain itself; it 
              seems like a thin vapour spread over the surface. The white of this 
              Hua-Shih is known as ivory white.*</p>
            <p>V. Designs are also painted on porcelain with Shih-kao; t as well 
              as with Hua-Shih, which gives another cast to it ; but the Shih-kao 
              has this peculiarity, that before it is prepared it has to be roasted 
              in the oven, and after that it is treated in the same way as Hua-Shih 
              or Kao-lin. This Shih-kao cannot be used to make the body of porcelain, 
              and up to now they have only found the material Hua-Shih that can 
              take the place of Kao-lin, and give firmness to the porcelain.</p>
            <p>VI. I have not spoken of a kind of glaze called Tauchin, that is, 
              burnished-gold glaze. I should be more inclined to call it bronze, 
              coffee-coloured or dead-leaf coloured glaze. This glaze is a new 
              invention.+ To make it they take common yellow clay and give it 
              the same treatment as Pe-tun-tse, and then they use it in a liquid 
              state like ordinary glaze. This fluid yellow clay is first mixed 
              with powdered Pe-tun-tse and some of the ashes of lime and fern. 
              The proportions of these ingredients are varied according as they 
              intend the colour to be darker or lighter. They tried to make a 
              mixture of gold-leaf with glaze and powdered flint, which they applied 
              in the same way as the red glaze, but this experiment was unsuccessful, 
              and they have found that the burnished-gold glaze just mentioned 
              is more elegant and more brilliant. There was a time when they made 
              cups that had a golden glaze outside, with the purest white glaze 
              inside; since then they have adopted another method, and on the 
              cup or vase that they intend to glaze with this burnished-gold glaze, 
              they attach to the vases in one or two places, shaped pieces of 
              moistened paper, and after the brown coating is applied, the paper 
              is taken off and the reserved white panels are painted with a design 
              in red or blue colour. When the piece is dry it is coated with the 
              ordinary glaze, either by being blown or by any other method. Sometimes 
              these spaces are left with a blue or black ground on which designs 
              in gold are applied after the first firing, but in this style one 
              can imagine many different combinations.</p>
            <p>VII. They have shown me this year for the first time a kind of 
              porcelain that is now in vogue, which is olive-green in colour, 
              and to which they give the name Lung Ch'uan.* I have seen some that 
              were called Ch'ing-kuo, the name of a fruit very like our olives. 
              This colour is obtained by mixing seven cups of the above-mentioned 
              Tzu-chin glaze with four cups of stone glaze, and two cups, or thereabouts, 
              of lime and. fern-ash glaze with one cup of powdered flint; all 
              these being mixed in the slip state. The addition of the flint slip 
              produces little veins in the porcelain. When this is applied by 
              itself the porcelain is very fragile, and does not sound when it 
              is struck, but when it is mixed with the other glaze the porcelain, 
              although covered with a network of veins, is no more fragile than 
              usual. </p>
            <p>VIII. The shining black or mirror-black glaze is obtained by dipping 
              the porcelain in a fluid mixture composed of the prepared blue colour. 
              It is not necessary to employ for this purpose the finest blue, 
              but it must be used to considerable strength, and mixed with the 
              glaze used for the burnished-gold glaze as well as with the ordinary 
              glaze. This mixture is a glaze in itself, and in firing the ware 
              they take care to place it in the middle of the oven, and not near 
              the vault where the firing is most active.</p>
            <p><img src="images/chinese_vase2.jpg" alt="Chinese vase of the period" width="152" height="300" align="left">IX. 
              I was mistaken when I said in my previous letter that the red glaze 
              called Yu-li-hung was made with the red colour from copperas, such 
              as is used for painting red colour on the fired white glaze. This 
              red glaze is made from granulated red copper, and the powder of 
              a certain stone or flint that is a little reddish in colour,* pounded 
              together in a mortar, and mixed with a boy's urine and with the 
              ordinary white glaze. I have not been able to learn the preparation 
              of these ingredients, and those who know this secret are very careful 
              not to divulge it. The mixture is applied to porcelain that has 
              not been fired, and no other glaze is necessary, but they have to 
              be careful during the firing that the red colour does not run to 
              the bottom of the vase. I am assured that for this red glaze they 
              use no Pe-tun-tse in the porcelain paste, but they employ with the 
              Kao-lin a yellow clay prepared in the same manner as Pe-tun-tse. 
              It is likely that such a clay is more suitable for developing this 
              particular colour.</p>
            <p>[Then follows an account of the preparation of the granulated copper, 
              which is of purely technical interest. The worthy father also tells 
              us that the Chinese at this time were unacquainted with aqua-fortis 
              or aqua-regia, and he adds with the utmost naivet&eacute;, &quot; 
              their inventions are all extremely simple. &quot;]</p>
            <p>X. They have executed this year designs of a kind which they assured 
              me were impracticable. These are vases three feet or more in height 
              with a lid, which is a pyramid, rising a foot higher. These vases 
              were made in three pieces, joined together with so much skill and 
              neatness that they form one whole without showing the seams. In 
              showing them to me they stated that out of eighty specimens they 
              had made eight only successfully ; all the others being lost. These 
              were ordered by merchants from Canton who trade with Europeans, 
              for in China they do not desire such expensive porcelains.</p>
            <p>XI. They have brought me one piece of porcelain called Yao-pien 
              or transmutation. This transmutation takes place in the furnace, 
              and is caused either by excess or lack of heat, or by some other 
              obscure causes which are not easily guessed at. This piece, though 
              the workmen tell me it is the result of mere chance, and is a failure 
              in manufacture, is not less beautiful nor less highly prized. It 
              was the intention to make vases in souffl&eacute; red, and a hundred 
              pieces were entirely spoiled ; the piece that I am speaking of came 
              out of the oven like a piece of agate.* By incurring the necessary 
              risk and expense of various experiments, it might be possible to 
              discover the art of making with certainty what has once been the 
              result of chance. The brilliant mirror-black glaze is an instance 
              of this-where what was once the caprice of the oven has been converted 
              into a successful manufacture.</p>
            <p>XII. When they want to use an extremely white glaze they mix only 
              one cupful of the glaze of the fern ashes with thirteen cupfuls 
              of the stone glaze. This glaze is a very strong one, and cannot 
              be used with underglaze blue colour, for the colour would not show 
              through it when it was fired. The porcelain to which this strong 
              glaze has been given may be exposed without any fear to the greatest 
              heat of the oven. Pieces altogether white are fired in this way, 
              or for subsequent decoration with gilding, or for colours that are 
              fired another time; but if they want to paint the porcelain in blue 
              or any other underglaze colours, then they mix with one cupful of 
              the ashes of lime and bracken only seven cupfuls of the stone glaze. 
              It should be observed that when the glaze contains a good deal of 
              the ashes of lime and bracken, the porcelain must be fired in a 
              temperate part of the oven ; that is to say, either after the first 
              three rows of cases or about a foot or a foot and a half from the 
              bottom ; for if they were fired higher up in the oven the glaze 
              ashes would melt rapidly and flow down on the porcelain. The same 
              thing follows with the red glaze, on account of the granulated copper 
              which enters into its composition, while on the contrary the crackled 
              glaze can be fired higher up in the oven.</p>
            <p>XIII. There is something to correct in what I said in the previous 
              letter about the colours fired on the finished glaze. [The worthy 
              father then gives an account of the Chinese weights, which need 
              not be translated.] I spoke in a previous letter about the on-glaze 
              red made from copperas or Tsao-fan. The red powder is mixed with 
              five times its weight of white lead, and the mixture sifted together. 
              The mixture after being sifted is incorporated with water thickened 
              with a little ox-glue, something like isinglass. They make a white 
              colour by using the most transparent pebbles they have calcined 
              in a porcelain crucible buried in the gravel at the bottom of the 
              oven, and afterwards reducing it to an impalpable powder.* To make 
              the white colour they mix thirty-three parts of this white powder 
              with 1oo parts of white lead, and apply it with plain water. A dark. 
              green colour is made by mixing together one hundred parts of white 
              lead, thirty-three parts of powdered flint, and eight parts of copper 
              scales, the scum which forms on the surface of copper when it is 
              melted, and this scum has to be carefully ground and washed to remove 
              from it any granulated copper that is mixed with it. A yellow is 
              made from a mixture of one hundred parts of white lead, thirty-three 
              parts of powdered flint, eighteen parts of pure oxide of iron, or 
              of the pure red made from copperas ; though another workman tells 
              me that he uses twenty-five parts of primitive red. t A dark blue 
              colour with a tinge of violet is made by mixing one hundred parts 
              of white lead, thirty-three parts of powdered flint, and o'2 parts 
              of azure blue,* though I am told by another workman that it requires 
              o-S parts of this azure blue. A very clear green called water-green 
              is made by mixing one part of the dark green colour with two parts 
              of the white colour, while a mixture of two parts of dark green 
              and one part of yellow produces a yellowish green which resembles 
              a slightly faded leaf. To make a black pigment they dilute the azure 
              blue largely with water and mix it with a little gelatin. When this 
              colour is painted on it looks black, and the black parts are covered 
              with white, which incorporates with the black during the second 
              fire, just as the glaze is incorporated with the underglaze blue 
              in coniron porcelains.<br>
              There is another colour called Tsiu$ from which they make a deep 
              violet colour. There is some found in Canton, and some comes from 
              Peking, but the latter is much the best. Like the other colours 
              just described this is used only on the porcelain which is re-fired.</p>
            <p>[Pere d'Entrecolles then describes how the porcelain painters prepare 
              this Tsiu. He was informed that it was a natural mineral, but the 
              whole account shows that it was simply a blue glass, which was ground, 
              washed, and prepared for porcelain painting.</p>
            <p>To gild or silver porcelains they put one part of white lead to 
              ten parts of finely-ground leaf-gold or silver. When silver is used 
              on the brown glaze it has a beautiful sheen. If some pieces are 
              painted in gold and others in silver, the silvered porcelain must 
              not stay so long in the little furnace as the gilded, otherwise 
              the silver will disappear before the gold has reached the point 
              of heat required to give it its proper brightness.</p>
            <p><img src="images/chinese_vase1.jpg" alt="Chinese vase of the period" width="134" height="300" align="left">XIV. 
              There is a cheaper kind of coloured porcelain made here, and it 
              may be that some of the information I am about to give may be of 
              some use to the makers of faience, if they are unable to make Chinese 
              porcelain to perfection. For this kind of work it is not necessary 
              that the materials should be so fine. Cups are used which have already 
              been fired in the porcelain oven without glaze, and which are, of 
              course, quite white. If these are wished to be in one colour they 
              are dipped in the simple colour, but if they are to be in many colours, 
              the colours are applied with a big brush. No other preparation is 
              used for these colours, except that sometimes, after they have been 
              fired, a little vermilion is put upon certain parts, as for example 
              on the beaks of birds; but this colour would disappear if it were 
              fired in the ovens, and so it lasts but a little time. These pieces 
              are re-fired in the large furnace along with the other porcelains 
              that have not been fired, but they are placed in the coolest parts 
              of the oven, where the fire is not so active, because an intense 
              heat would destroy the colours. For this kind of porcelain the colours 
              are prepared as follows :-The green is made of oxide of copper, 
              saltpetre, and powdered flint ; the commonest azure blue material, 
              similarly mixed with saltpetre and powdered flint, forms the violet 
              colour; the yellow is made by mixing one part of copperas-red with 
              ten parts of powdered flint, and ten parts of white lead; and the 
              white colour by a mixture of four parts of powdered flint to ten 
              parts of white lead. All these ingredients are mixed together with 
              water, and that is all I have been able to learn about the colours 
              of this kind of porcelain, as none of my converts are employed in 
              this business.*</p>
            <p>XV. I said in my previous letter that when the painted porcelains 
              were put into the kiln for the second firing, that the smaller ones 
              were placed into the larger, and that they were arranged like that 
              in the kiln. To this I must now add that they have to be careful 
              that the porcelain pieces do not touch one another in places where 
              they have been painted, or the pieces would be spoiled. The work 
              people arrange the pieces in the following way :-They fill the bottom 
              of the kiln with the porcelain pieces, and then they cover these 
              with lids made of the same clay from which the sides of the kiln 
              are made, or even with pieces of broken sagger, for in China everything 
              is made use of; on this cover they lay another range of these porcelain 
              pieces, and so on up to the top of the kiln.</p>
            <p>XVI. I was not very well informed when I said in my first letter 
              that they recognised that the painted or gilt porcelains are sufficiently 
              fired when they see the gold and colours shine out in all their 
              brightness. I have since learnt that the colours only reveal themselves 
              after the refired porcelain pieces have had time to cool. They judge 
              that these pieces are sufficiently fired when, looking through the 
              top hole they see that all the pieces are red down to the bottom, 
              and, through the fire that surrounds them, they can distinguish 
              one form from another. Likewise when the painted porcelains have 
              lost the unevenness where the colour has been piled on, and the 
              colours have sunk well into the glaze.</p>
            <p>With regard to the porcelains that are fired in the big ovens, 
              they judge that the firing is perfect (r) when the flame that comes 
              out from the top is no longer red, but is white; (2) when looking 
              through the holes they see that the saggers are quite red; (3) after 
              having opened one of the top saggers and taken out a piece of porcelain 
              they find when it is cool that the glaze and colours are as they 
              should be; and finally (4) when in looking through the top of the 
              oven they see the gravel at the bottom is all glittering. It is 
              by these signs that the workman judges if the porcelain pieces are 
              fired to perfection.</p>
            <p>XVII. When they wish to cover a vase entirely with blue, they use 
              the blue mineral prepared and diluted in water to the right consistency, 
              and then they dip the vase into it. For the powder-blue they use 
              the most beautiful azure prepared in the way that I have already 
              explained. This is blown on the vase, and when it is dry they cover 
              it with the ordinary glaze, or with glaze mixed with powdered flint 
              if they want the glaze to be crackled. Certain workpeople trace 
              figures on this azure-blue with the point of a long pin. The pin 
              makes as many little dots in the dry azure as is necessary to represent 
              the figure, and after that the glaze is applied. When such a piece 
              is fired the design seems to be performed in the style of a miniature.</p>
            <p>XVIII. The pieces on which one sees embossed flowers, dragons and 
              such-like things, are not so difficult to manufacture as one might 
              think. The designs are first traced with a graver on the body of 
              the vase, and then the ground about it is cut away so as to form 
              the relief, and afterwards the piece is glazed.</p>
            <p>XIX. When I spoke in my first letter of the way in which the azure 
              colour is prepared, I omitted to give three particulars, which are 
              worthy of attention. First, before it is buried in the gravel on 
              the bed of the oven, where it is to be roasted, it is well washed 
              to remove the clay that adheres to it. Second, it must be put into 
              a well-luted porcelain crucible. Third, when it is roasted it is 
              broken up, sifted, and put into a glazed vessel; boiling water is 
              then poured over it and well stirred. The scum that floats on the 
              top is removed, and the powder is washed as much as may be necessary. 
              The washed paste is then thrown into a mortar, where it is ground 
              for a considerable time. They have assured me that the azure is 
              found in coal-mines or in the red clay, which occurs in the neighbourhood 
              of these coal-mines. Sometimes fragments are found on the surface 
              of the earth, and that is a sure sign that more may be obtained 
              by digging. It occurs in small pieces not bigger than the large 
              finger, but flat and not rounded.* The ordinary mineral is fairly 
              common, but the fine kinds are very rare, and it is not easy to 
              distinguish them by their appearance. They can only be proved by 
              experience. If good azure-blue or enamel-blue could be supplied 
              by Europe, a valuable trade might be done with Ching-te-chen in 
              very little bulk, and they would exchange for it their most beautiful 
              porcelains.</p>
            <p>XX. They have attempted to make black designs on porcelain vases 
              with the finest Chinese ink, but this attempt has been unsuccessful, 
              for when the porcelain is fired it turns out quite white. Doubtless 
              the particles of this black have not enough substance, so that they 
              are dispersed by the action of fire, or they have not the power 
              of penetrating the layer of glaze so as to produce a difference.* 
              I finish these remarks by recommending to your prayers the Church 
              of Ching-te-chen, which contains a great number of workers in porcelain.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>* It is pretty clear from this where so many of the English potters 
              of the eighteenth century, at Bristol, Liverpool, Worcester, and 
              elsewhere, got the idea of using soap-stone.<br>
              * The latest opinion is that the mineral used by the Chinese potters 
              under the name of Hua-Shih is not soapstone at all, but an impure 
              kao-lin containing a large proportion of white mica. (See p. 12.) 
              t Gypsum or sulphate of lime.<br>
              $ Dr. Bushell points out that the worthy father must be mistaken 
              here as he has found this glaze recorded in Ming times. It is the 
              well-known fond laque of French writers.<br>
              &#8226; This is Dr. Bushell's modernisation of Pere d'Entrecolles' 
              word, Long-tsivem.&quot;<br>
              t This evidently refers to a kind of crackled celadon porcelain, 
              made in<br>
              imitation of the Lung-ch'uan celadons of Sung times.<br>
              * Such an occurrence as this may have furnished the starting point 
              of the porcelains made in imitation of agate and other stones some 
              twenty years after the date of this letter. (See p. tz8.)<br>
              * Dr. Bushell points out that this most transparent powder used 
              for the white is probably native white arsenic. t The primitive 
              red appears to be a fine oxide of iron, probably a pounded hematite.</p>
            <p>&#8226; The azure blue is the impure manganiferous oxide of cobalt 
              used as the underglaze blue of the Chinese.</p>
            <p>t For painting on the glaze.</p>
            <p>f Dr. Bushell says this must be a misprint for Ts'ui, which is 
              the name of a blue glass used in China by enamellers on metals.</p>
            <p>* These porcelains were either single-colours of turquoise, purple 
              violet, or yellow glaze-or were pieces painted in coloured glazes 
              after the style of the earliest Ming painted pieces (see p. 66 and 
              Plate q).<br>
              * This is an earthy mineral known as &quot;wad,&quot; containing 
              manganese and cobalt mixed with clay. In its unrefined state it 
              only contains from<br>
              5 % to ro g of cobalt oxide.</p>
            <p>* It was only at a later period that the Chinese produced designs 
              painted in a greyish black, so that they look as if they had been 
              drawn in<br>
              sepia or Chinese-ink.</p>
            <p>?? * Dr. Bushell makes the excellent suggestion that this is Amethystine 
              Quartz ; though Pere d'Entrecolles says that a Christian doctor 
              told him the stone was a species of alum, which was employed in 
              medicine.</p>
