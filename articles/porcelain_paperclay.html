              </CENTER>
            <P align="left">In July, 2000, I began a research project 
              with the assistance of a Faculty Research Grant from The College 
              of Fine Arts,University of New South Wales to investigate the properties 
              and potential of porcelain paperclay. </P>
            <P align="left">My studio work is concerned with the vulnerability 
              of being human, with the dynamics of how we interact as a community 
              and the consequent processes of acceptance and rejection. Hence, 
              the juxtaposition of light and shadow has held significance for 
              me as a metaphor for inclusion and exclusion. I have been searching 
              for a medium that will convey fragility and vulnerability but one 
              that also has a degree of permanence. In early 2000 I had read an 
              article by Steve Harrison ‘The making of paperclay porcelain banners’ 
              (Pottery in Australia 37/2 1998 p68-69). In this article, Harrison 
              describes how he makes paper-thin porcelain banners of translucency 
              that can be imprinted with &quot;tools fingers and objects&quot;. 
            </P>
            <P align="center"><img src="../images/stevens_paperclay2.jpg" width="211" height="155" hspace="4"></P>
            <P align="left">It seemed that this medium had potential for the type 
              of sculpture I wanted to produce. My aims were twofold. Firstly, 
              I wanted to find a way of imprinting thin sheets of this body with 
              a photographic image to produce a watermarked effect. That is, I 
              wanted to find a way (without using any ink), of pressing a photographic 
              image into the clay body, using some appropriate kind of intaglio 
              printing plate, in order to yield a heavily embossed image which 
              when backlit, would produce a photographic watermark. Secondly, 
              I wanted to explore the potential of this body for producing 3D 
              forms that would lend themselves to illumination. </P>
            <P align="left">My starting point was his recipe for porcelain paperclay 
              :</P>
            <div align="left"> 
              <ul>
                <li>Clay Ceram&#9;&#9;&#9;50 %</li>
                <li>Nepheline Syenite&#9;&#9;50%</li>
                </ul>Add<ul>
                <li>Ceramic fibre (1000&#730;C)&#9; &#9; 8 %</li>
                <li>Fine paper pulp&#9;&#9; &#9;17 %</li>
                <li>Water&#9;&#9;&#9; &#9; 30%</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <P align="left">The clay body is fired to cone 8 in an electric kiln.</P>
            <P align="left">The ceramic fibre helps to stabilize the body after 
              the paper pulp has burnt out at 250ºC and stops the thin sheets 
              from cracking &quot;along the stress lines created by the decoration&quot;.</P>
            <P align="left">The initial process of familiarizing myself with porcelain 
              paperclay body proved to be not as straightforward as I anticipated. 
              The result of my first batch was coarse textured and short, totally 
              inappropriate for holding the imprint of a recognizable photographic 
              image.</P>
            <P align="left"><img src="../images/stevens_paperclay3.jpg" width="210" height="155" hspace="4" align="left">To 
              produce a finer textured body I used shredded ceramic fibre (rather 
              than ceramic blanket which I had used initially, that had to be 
              laboriously torn into tiny pieces) and mixed it with a heavy-duty 
              blunger in about four liters of water, until satisfied with its 
              homogeneous consistency. I mixed the paper pulp in a similar way 
              and with about the same amount of water, but I used boiling water 
              this time, to help break down the fibres. The ceramic fibre and 
              paper pulp were then thoroughly mixed with the blunger and the other 
              dry ingredients were added.</P>
            <P align="left">The extra water in the mix, which allowed for easier 
              blending, was removed by heaping the clay on a plastic tarpaulin 
              and allowing the clear water to run off over a few days. The resultant 
              body was sticky. I found the easiest way to work with it was to 
              roll it into slabs between sheets of heavy-duty plastic.</P>
            <P align="left"><b>Photographic Imprints</b></P>
            <P align="left">Initial trials of imprinting the porcelain body with 
              ceramic stamps were effective. The clay held the imprint crisply 
              and I was encouraged to think that a photographic image would be 
              possible if the right type of ‘stamp’ (plate) could be found. I 
              had used solar etching plates to produce photographic etchings in 
              printmaking and thought it might be possible to use such a plate 
              to imprint the clay. Unfortunately, the solar plate was unsuitable 
              for this process because the light sensitive emulsion on the plate 
              was unable to maintain the sustained contact with the clay body 
              necessary to imprint it. The emulsion absorbed moisture from the 
              clay body, expanded and separated from the backing plate. The resilience 
              of the high cellulose content in the body also prevented it from 
              being able to hold the fine imprint to any degree that would produce 
              an effective image.</P>
            <P align="left">In a photographic exhibition of work by Jenny Pollack 
              and Louis Vidal, entitled ‘Passages’, (Customs House Sydney, November 
              2000) I saw embossed photocopies of photographs that had been produced 
              to make a tactile, readable surface for people with impaired vision. 
              These photocopies are produced with a special heat-sensitive paper 
              which when passed through a PIAF machine reacts to raise the areas 
              printed with ink to give a kind of Braille photocopy. With the help 
              of Michael Keighery at the University of Western Sydney, Milperra, 
              I was able to produce a photographic 3D image. By using a printing 
              press, I imprinted this image into a standard clay body and the 
              imprint was sharp and readable. When I repeated the process with 
              the porcelain paperclay the resilience of the cellulose once again 
              reduced the clarity of the image. I discovered that by allowing 
              the paperclay mix to age (at least one month), this resilience was 
              reduced and the readability of the image improved, but the results 
              read more as a silhouette than a photographic image.</P>
            <P align="left">An article in Ceramic Review May/June 2001 presented 
              research by Helen Smith at the University of the West of England 
              on the potential of using flexography to emboss paperclay with a 
              photographic image.</P>
            <P align="left">Further inquires within the printing industry led 
              me to a du Pont product named Cyrel&reg;. This proved to be just 
              what I was searching for. Cyrel&reg; is a flexible vinyl plate of 
              approximately 10 mm thickness to which a photographic image can 
              be transferred by placing a photographic transparency on the plate 
              and exposing it to intense UV light. The process duplicates even 
              the minutest detail and the resulting stamp-like plate will effectively 
              imprint the porcelain paperclay.</P>
            <P align="left">I roll the clay to a similar thickness to the Cyrel 
              plate, spray the top of the slab with a fine mist of water and smooth 
              the surface with a plastic ruler. I then leave it to a dry leatherhard 
              state and use a rolling pin to imprint the clay with the plate. 
              By drying the imprinted slab slowly over a few days I avoid any 
              warping. The slab is then fired slowly on a flat even bed of white 
              silica sand in an electric kiln to cone 8. </P>
            <P align="center"><img src="../images/stevens_paperclay4.jpg" width="238" height="195" hspace="5"></P>
            <P align="left">The fired porcelain paperclay is porous and fragile. 
              As Steve Harrison suggests, it can be painted with acrylic medium 
              to give it strength and flexibility and the medium gives the surface 
              an almost imperceptible luster. Early results have been most encouraging, 
              to my mind opening up enormous possibilities for future development.</P>
            <P align="left"><b>3D Forms</b></P>
            <P align="left">In my initial attempts to produce three-dimensional 
              forms, I experimented with various construction and firing techniques 
              and although the paperclay was effective at the construction stage, 
              immense care had to be taken during drying to avoid warping. I found 
              the most effective construction technique was to work with leather 
              hard or even totally dry slabs that had been cut to the desired 
              shape with a sharp blade and to join them with a slightly drier 
              than normal paper porcelain slip. It was also possible to roll partially 
              dried slabs into cylindrical forms. However, during firing, even 
              with meticulously built supports, the forms warped slightly and 
              although in some cases this was acceptable, it was too ‘organic’ 
              for the type of form I wished to produce at this point.</P>
            <P align="left">For my purposes, I overcame this weakness by constructing 
              the forms after firing. In the first instance where I wanted to 
              convey a sense of precariousness and tension, and the fragility 
              of sanctuary, I layered the sheets to create the 3D form. In another 
              piece that addresses the effort that must go into the construction 
              of sanctuary, I perforated the edges of the sheets and sewed them 
              together. The results have been rewarding, to my mind embodying 
              all the fragility and vulnerability I had hoped to convey.</P>
            <P align="left">Porcelain paperclay while challenging traditional 
              methods of production, has presented possibilities for my studio 
              practice. The edges possible with this body, its translucency and 
              affinity for light, and its seeming fragility are qualities I intend 
              to investigate further.</P>
            <P align="left">Because of the health hazards associated with ceramic 
              fibre and dry paper pulp, it is essential to use a facemask and 
              gloves while mixing this body. Mix the clay in an area with sufficient 
              ventilation and when touching the ceramic fibre, cover as much of 
              your body as possible with protective clothing.</P>
