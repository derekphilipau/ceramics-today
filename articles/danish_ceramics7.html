<P align="center"> <strong>Herman August K&auml;hler Pottery, Nestved</strong> 
              (on Zealand) 1839-1974 
            <P align="center"><a href="images/danish/map.gif"><img src="images/danish/map_sm.gif" alt="Map of Denmark" width="98" height="122" border="0"></a> 
            <p>Posterity can thank potter Joachim Christian Herman K&auml;hler 
              (1808-1884) that he left the duchy Holstein in 1839 and established 
              a workshop in Nestved. This way, the foundation stone to the biggest 
              flagship within the Danish ceramics, was laid. In the first 30 years 
              he produced all-night burners, spring water jars and articles for 
              the everyday use in the kitchen. In 1872 his sons Herman August 
              K&auml;hler (1846-1917) and Carl Frederik K&auml;hler (1850-1920) 
              took over the pottery. Herman August took over the production of 
              all-night burners. He however followed his intuition and started 
              his own workshop, and in 1875 he established what we today know 
              as K&auml;hlers Pottery in Nestved. Carl was left alone and decided 
              to sell his part.</p>
            <p>Herman August K&auml;hler introduced the <b><u><span
lang=DA><img width=43 height=20
src="images/danish2/image110.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1079"></span></u></b> signature, 
              which since that time has been the mark on all K&auml;hlers products. 
              In 1883 Vilhelm Klein (1835-1913, architect) from &quot;the Copenhagen 
              Drawing School for Women&quot; was looking for a pottery where he 
              could have his students' ceramics fired. This resulted in a co-operation 
              with Herman August K&auml;hler. This co-operation gave Herman August 
              the inspiration to start production of other items than all-night 
              burners. He experimented again and again with glazes. The target 
              was a red luster glaze, like the one used by the Italian maestro 
              Giorgio from Gubbio in the 16th century. In 1888 he presented a 
              ruby glaze which made him world famous. This ruby is today known 
              as &quot;K&auml;hler red&quot;.</p>
            <p align="center"><span lang=DA style='font-size:10.0pt'><img
src="images/danish2/image072.jpg" alt="Herman A. K&auml;hler, 1890 (K&auml;hler R&oslash;d)" width=179 height=141 v:shapes="_x0000_i1060"></span></p>
            <p>In the meantime artists were eager to be a part of the K&auml;hler 
              studio in Nestved. Between 1885-1907 Hans Andersen Brendekilde (1857-1942, 
              painter) decorated some items with motifs from fairytales and legendary 
              figures - Trolls and witches. From 1886-1888 Carl Ove Julian Lund 
              known as &quot;deaf Lund&quot; (1857-1936, china painter) tried 
              fine underglaze painting; but this technique wasn't as good on ceramics 
              as on china, so this failed. From 1888-1914 Karl Hansen-Reistrup 
              (1863-1929, painter and visual artist) became artistic leader of 
              the pottery. He had a close cooperation with Herman August The vases 
              and pots that he designed and Herman August turned, was decorated 
              with modeled animal heads, which in their art-nouveau style was 
              perfect suitable for the new &quot;K&auml;hler red&quot; luster 
              glaze. This cooperative work was presented at the World Exhibition 
              in Paris 1889. The public was carried away by the &quot;K&auml;hler 
              red&quot; and with one stroke K&auml;hler was world famous. Many 
              international Museums made purchases.</p>
            <p>Hansen-Reistrup produced a number of wall friezes - among those 
              the &quot;Peacock-frieze&quot; in 1897, which was sold to the National 
              Museum in Stockholm. The &quot;Eagle-frieze&quot; which can be seen 
              at the S&egrave;vres-Museum. Also the elephants at the Carlsberg 
              Brewery in Copenhagen are his work. From 1889-1890 Laurits Andersen 
              Ring (1854-1933, painter) produced only a few things - he preferred 
              painting. In 1896 he married the daughter of Herman August Sigrid 
              K&auml;hler (1874-1923). Before her marriage Sigrid worked with 
              flower decorations at the pottery.</p>
            <p>From 1890-1891 Thorvald Bindesboell (1846-1908, architect and sculptor) 
              was designing vases and pots with sgraffito (scratched patterns) 
              and slipping in abstract motifs, in the French &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; 
              style (period 1890-1910) in Germany it was called &quot;Jugendstil&quot; 
              and in Denmark &quot;Skoenvirke&quot;. The Skoenvirke or the Jugendstil 
              was a bit later and longer in Denmark. It was the same Style but 
              the period was 1890-1920. Bindesboell is very dominating - a prima 
              donna - and he doesn't find that there is room enough for both him 
              and Hansen-Reistrup. Herman August did not agree and the message 
              to Bindesboell was &quot;If you don't like the heat, get out of 
              the kitchen&quot;. The years are extremely successful. The K&auml;hler 
              Pottery is winning prizes on exhibitions all over the world. They 
              are selling to the leading galleries and art museums both in Europe 
              and USA.</p>

            <p>From 1901 the son of Herman August - Herman Hans Christian K&auml;hler 
              (1876-1940) takes over the leadership. A new era begins. Herman 
              Hans Christian was tired of the &quot;K&auml;hler Red&quot; and 
              thought that it was time for a change. He was, like his contemporary 
              Bertel Ipsen, from <a href="danish_ceramics4.html"><strong>P. Ipsens
              Enke</strong></a>, fascinated by Bindesboell and his slipped ceramics. 
              So it was a stroke of luck when Svend Hammershoei arrived to the 
              pottery and started his production of slipped ceramics. From 1908 
              Herman Hans Christian takes up the horn painting again. This technique 
              suits the pots good and ceramics decorated with slipped horn painting 
              is typical for what we today associate with the &quot;K&auml;hler 
              Style&quot;. The Horn Painting was a difficult technique. The tool 
              was a hollowed cow horn with a goose quill. The horn was filled 
              up with the slip, which afterwards was dosed through the goose quill, 
              used as a pen. Herman Hans Christian and his journeymen mastered 
              the craft and often up to 10 horns were used at the same time decorating 
              a vase. The first items were decorated in dark brown, blue and green 
              with patterns in the Jugendstyle (Skoenvirke). Later on both colors 
              and patterns became lighter.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Svend Hammershoei (1873-1948 painter) was the artist who had the 
              longest cooperation with K&auml;hler from 1893-1948 . In those years 
              he developed all the time which is also reflected in his ceramics. 
              Maybe he found inspiration while he was occupied with other activities 
              as painting and writing (about Bindesboell). He had worked together 
              with Bindesboell in the 1890s at G. Eifrig, Copenhagen Pottery. 
              It was a tempestuous cooperation where Hammershoei's great skill 
              was put to use. Often he turned and did the modeling according to 
              Bindesboell's drawings and then Bindesboell just signed the works. 
              In the beginning his vases and pots with slipped relief decoration 
              in leaf ornamentation, was clearly impressed by Bindesboell. Later 
              he tried an antique terracotta design, also with leaves ornamentations 
              or with stamped impressions. Hammershoei then moved in the direction 
              of geometrical design, with characteristic profiling, often fixed 
              with small modeled&quot;buds&quot;. These items with the gray/black/white 
              glaze (invented by Jens Thirslund) was an enormous success and today 
              it is the kind of K&auml;hler- ceramics which people associate with 
              Hammershoei. Hammershoei never got married and had no children, 
              but in his studio and on his many journeys his substitute children 
              - his dolls - followed him. </p>
            <p>1913-1941 - Jens Thirslund (1892-1942 painter). In 1914 he married 
              Herman August's daughter, Stella K&auml;hler (1886-1948, decorator). 
              He became artistic leader of the factory. Thirslund had an born 
              talent for painting. A bohemian type, who set up his own area in 
              the pottery as a real artistic den filled with all sorts of goods 
              and chattels from floor to roof. It became a rendezvous for the 
              artists from all over. The artistic inspiration he derived from 
              the Oriental was often spiced with a sense of humor. He became a 
              true master in painting with luster glazes.</p>

            <p>In 1917 Herman August K&auml;hler dies. After the 1st world war 
              the number of agents worldwide were extended. K&auml;hler ceramics 
              were represented at most recognized museums, e.g. in the USA at 
              the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Items were sold through Zacho &amp; 
              Co in Hollywood, the Frankl Galleries in New York and The Associated 
              Merchandising Cooperation.</p>

            <p>After Herman Hans Christian's death in 1940 the 4th generation 
              takes over. Nils Joakim K&auml;hler (1906-1979, potter) takes care 
              of the artistic side and Herman Joergen K&auml;hler (1904-1996, 
              potter) takes care of administration and glaze production. Nils 
              K&auml;hler had been working together with Hammershoei and continued 
              this style, in a modern version with the gray/black/white Thirslund 
              glaze. Cylindrical design in stoneware with yellow and turquoise 
              glaze, often with stamped decorations in fishbone pattern. Besides 
              the <b><u><span

              Nils K&auml;hler always signed his items with 'Nils'. Nils K&auml;hler 
              left his stamp on the factory until 1968, when the two brothers 
              separate and the factory closes in 1974. An era is finished in Danish 
              ceramics but the many K&auml;hler journeymen, who started their 
              own potteries, all over Denmark uphold the grand traditions and 
              the K&auml;hlers have for ever put their stamp on Danish ceramics.</p>
