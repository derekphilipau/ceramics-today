              A vase drew me into a small gallery in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture. 
              It was a vase with naturally graceful presence. There was perfect 
              harmony between the sand beige coloured base and the glowing scarlet 
              pattern on such a gentle form, I felt warm comfort surround me. 
              <BR>
              <br>
              This sensation was what I had been longing for in Bizen-ware since 
              my first Bizen experience in my childhood. I often visited galleries 
              that specialised in Bizen pottery in Tokyo, journeys attempting 
              to recapture those comfortable feelings. Despite my quest, ceramics 
              at stylish galleries in Tokyo left me cold and uninspired. My search 
              brought me to Okayama, the birthplace of Bizen. Unlike my expectations, 
              most of the works I saw were mass-produced expressionless souvenirs. 
              I had nearly come to the conclusion that Bizen had lost its warmth 
              until I chanced upon an exhibition in Kurashiki. I immediately sensed 
              a peaceful energy from the exhibits and explored them keenly with 
              my eyes and hands. <BR>
              <br>
              "What element makes your creations so warm and attractive?" <BR>
              <br>
              I could not help asking a man who appeared to be the potter in the 
              gallery. <BR>
              <br>
              "Well," the man chose his words carefully and replied, "It could 
              be <STRONG>the flavour of the clay."</STRONG> <BR>
              <br>
              This was how I encountered the Bizen potter, Mr. Mamoru Taku and 
              his works. <BR>
              <img src="images/mamoru_taku/Taku-sanTalking.jpg" width="135" height="180" alt="Taku-san" border="0" align="left">	
              <br>
              "I can see subtle gravel residue in your ceramics. The surface could 
              potentially appear rough with gravel, but on the contrary, the texture 
              shows a smooth organic flow. Would this be characteristic of Bizen 
              clay?" <BR>
              <br>
              Answering my question, Taku-san said, <BR>
              <br>
              "Bizen clay contains various organic properties (around 200 different 
              kinds) which I believe help to create the smooth texture of the 
              pottery. Even my hands have become very smooth after making Bizen 
              pottery for over two decades." <BR>
              <br>
              I read somewhere that Bizen potters used clay as a homemade vulnerary 
              ointment. Penicillin and other organic properties contained in Bizen 
              clay can cure wounds. <BR>
              <br>
              "<b>My mission is to express this organic flavour of Bizen clay. 
              </b> <BR>
              <br>
              Thus, clay preparation is of prime importance in my work. The firing 
              techniques and shapes are decided based upon the clay and the chosen 
              theme of the work." <BR>
              <br>
              "The vase you were studying is shaped using a classical method, 
              called 'Himo-tsukuri (ring-stacking).' It is the best shaping technique 
              bringing the clay's flavour to that particular vase. Clay in artefacts 
              made with 'Himo-tsukuri' keep their organic properties in tact. 
              Due to its uneven texture the light on 'Himo-tsukuri' works is refracted. 
              It could be this aspect that makes the works appear somewhat warm." 
              <BR>
              <br>
              Taku-san also told me that he had built his own kiln in order to 
              create the exact conditions for his creations. I was compelled to 
              explore &quot;Himo-tsukuri&quot; in more depth, to personally visit 
              Taku-san's kiln and understand the properties which made his subtle 
              creations so warm and attractive to the senses. I booked a ticket 
              to his studio in Takebe. <BR>

            <br>
            Taku-san took me to an outdoor corner near his studio and showed me 
            how he prepares the clay for his pottery. <br> <Br> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/ClayPrepShu.jpg" width="135" height="180" alt="Clay Preparation" border="0" align="left"> 
            "This first procedure should be done quickly, it is simply to moisten 
            the clay. If you knead clay too much, then its subtle organic properties 
            are lost." <BR> <br>
            Taku-san explained, as his assistant and son, Shusaku demonstrated 
            the procedure of mixing ground soil and water. <br> <BR>
            Currently Taku-san keeps over 20 sorts of mixed clay in his studio. 
            He picked up some from the shelf. <BR> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/BestHidasukiClay.jpg" width="160" height="120" alt="Best Clay for Hidasuki" border="0" align="right"> 
            <br>
            "This clay is the best for making 'Hidasuki' (fire-pattern on a light 
            base) works. I have not tampered with its content in any way. The 
            original clay, which is taken from the site, has just been moistened. 
            As you can see, this chunk contains various layers of different elements. 
            This clay includes natural elements I need for making old-style Bizen 
            'Hidasuki' works. However, it is not perfect, it is lacking one substantial 
            element, iron." <BR> <br>
            Taku-san showed me a fragment of pottery. <BR clear=all> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/OldHidasukiFragment.jpg" width="192" height="144" alt="Old Hidasuki Fragment" border="0" align="left"><br> 
            "This is a part of an old Hidasuki pottery. Do you see the tiny black 
            dots? These dots are oxidised iron created during the firing procedure. 
            <BR> <br>
            Iron darkens the colour of the pottery and it is therefore quite contradictory 
            to include iron when making light-coloured Hidasuki works. Most contemporary 
            'Hidasuki' artists use clay without iron, resulting in a clear light 
            coloured piece." <BR clear=all> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/Comp_ironW_WO.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="Comparison of with and w/o iron" border="0" align="right"> 
            As a comparison, Taku-san brought two tea bowls. <BR> <br>
            "The bowl on the table has a high iron content whilst this one in 
            my hand contains less."<br>
            The work containing more iron is slightly mottled and has a darker 
            hue whilst the other has a very smooth clean finish. For me the bowl 
            with the higher iron content has a richer, more intense flavour. <BR> 
            <br> "As I stated earlier, the best clay for 'Hidasuki' does not contain 
            iron, so I mix the clay with an iron-rich soil, taken from a site 
            near a historical kiln dating back more than 4 centuries. The iron-rich 
            soil is the equivalent to salt in cooking; it brings out the best 
            flavour of the material. This is the clay recipe I use for making 
            my classic 'Hidasuki' collections." <br> <br>
            "Throughout my studies of old Bizen masterpieces, I found that sometimes 
            the ingredients contain elements that theoretically shouldn't be put 
            together. The iron in the 'Hidasuki' work I showed you earlier is 
            a good example. The old masterpieces teach me that <STRONG>the inclusion 
            of only the 'best' materials to the exclusion of all others does not 
            necessarily create the 'best' works. Sometimes baser materials are 
            complimentary and enhance the created texture. Having the right thing 
            in the right place with the correct balance is the key.</STRONG> <BR> 
            <BR>
            "Have you heard of a technical term, 'levigation?' <br> <BR>
            It is a process suspending soil in water to separate the coarser material 
            from clay, a method commonly used by potters today. You can prepare 
            huge amounts of clay with this method and levigated clay is soft and 
            easy to shape. <img src="images/mamoru_taku/ClaySlices.jpg" width="170" height="146" alt="Clay Slices" border="0" align="left"> 
            I personally choose not to use levigated clay because the clay becomes 
            homogenised and many of the original organic properties are lost during 
            this procedure<br>
            However, I still need to filter out larger pieces of gravel to avoid 
            holes being created in the potteries. In order to do this, I divide 
            the clay into very thin slices then remove any coarse gravel that 
            is thicker than these slices." <BR clear="all"> <br>
            It was still a little hard for me to visualize the difference between 
            levigated clay and Taku-san's method and so I asked him, <br> <BR>
            "What happens if you mix seasoning clay such as the one containing 
            iron into levigated clay?" <BR> <br>
            He answered, "If you mix red and white paint, it makes pink paint. 
            But if you mix red sand into white sand, the result is different, 
            isn't it? The texture and colour is more mottled and uneven. Levigated 
            clay is more like paste. <br> <BR>
            Compared to levigation, my clay preparation is a process that requires 
            a lot of time and effort. If I prepared all my material with this 
            method then the number of items produced would be very limited. <BR> 
            <br>
            "Time is a concern for another reason. My collection includes introductory 
            works for daily use such as mugs and cups. They are equally as important 
            to me as my classic collection. I am happy if people can enjoy the 
            flavour of the clay from my mugs and cups in their daily life, and 
            then gain something deeper from my classic collections. <BR> <br>
            It is not practical to prepare all the clay for both the introductory 
            and classic collections using the earlier stated filtering method 
            so I came up with a solution that kept the clay flavour as much as 
            possible but took less time. If I got rid of the coarse gravel at 
            the soil grinding stage instead of using the slice filtering method 
            I could keep the quality of the introductory works intact despite 
            producing a greater quantity of them." <br> <BR>
            Taku-san means quality not just for the appearance, but the durability 
            of the products as well. He keeps natural, unevenly grained organic 
            properties for scientific as well as aesthetic reasons. <BR> <br>
            "Apart from adding to the clay flavour, uneven grains in the clay 
            actually strengthen the pottery. If you take a micro view of the pottery 
            in the kiln, you would see two dynamisms at work. One is a stabilising 
            force, the fire, and the other is an expansive force from clay counteracting 
            inside clay. Clay has a natural tendency to expand in heat, but the 
            potteries are shaped in certain forms and the force of the fire stabilises 
            the form. Thus two enormous counteracting energies are created inside 
            the potteries. The space in the uneven grains of clay lets out the 
            extraneous energy and adjusts the internal force balance. <BR> <Br>
            If you use clay with a very even grain, then the internal expanding 
            force is kept inside the potteries even after cooling. This remaining 
            expansive force is called 'intrinsic material stress' and becomes 
            activated when heated. So, if you microwave the potteries which still 
            have this 'intrinsic material stress', then the remaining expansive 
            force reacts with heat and it is likely to break from the inside. 
            <BR> <br>
            That is another reason why I prepare uneven, naturally formed clay 
            for my potteries." <BR> <br> <div align="right"><a href="#top"> <img src="images/mamoru_taku/button_top.gif" border="0" width="12" height="5" valign="middle">Page

            I came to learn that the vase that captured my attention at the gallery 
            in Kurashiki was one of Taku-san's lifeworks. It is called 'Hidasuki 
            Tsurukubi Vase,' translated as 'A Crane-necked vase with a fire pattern.'

            It was a soulful communication between Taku-san and his precious clay. 
            I saw how this method could bring out the true flavour of clay in 
            pottery. <BR> <br> <br>

            Taku-san built his second kiln by himself in 1998 and it is located 
            next to his studio. <BR>

                  ascending upwards along a gentle slope of about fifteen degrees. 
                  Measuring about 12 metres long it can house anywhere between 
                  500 and 2000 pieces of work. <Br> <BR>
                  Many potters nowadays use gas kilns for greater productivity, 
                  but Taku-san only fires his work with this wood fuelled kiln. 
                  Once the kiln is on fire, it burns continually for ten days. 
                  Depending on the type of works in the kiln, Taku-san adjusts 
                  the temperature, which can vary from 950 to 1250 degrees Celsius. 
                  The kiln takes the same amount of time to cool as it does to 
                  heat up. <br> <BR>
                  After hearing about all the hard work involved in firing products,

            themselves. This aspect means that the whole environment inside the 
            kiln is balanced in the best possible way for my pieces. The thermal 
            conduction and cooling time are the same for the kiln and its contents. 
            <BR> <br>
            One more consideration in this environment is the control of the ashes. 
            Ashes have a tendency to start glazing on an object with a lower calcining 
            temperature. Utilising this nature, I allow the lining bricks to collect 
            the ashes. The material for the lining has a lower calcining temperature 
            than the potteries. <BR> <br>
            The reaction to the heat from the glazed clay, the ash-covered clay 
            and plain clay are all different from each other. Glazed clay and 
            ashes contract whilst clay expands. If the ashes cover the works from 
            many directions, then the contraction power of the ashes overcomes 
            the clay, which can deform the potteries. It is therefore very important 
            to try to avoid this situation." <BR> <BR>
            Taku-san's kiln style is called 'Ana-gama (cave kiln).' It is an old 
            style kiln abandoned centuries ago, after the introduction of a more 
            productive style, called 'Nobori-gama (climbing kiln)' from Korea. 
            The interior of the climbing kiln is divided into rooms. The partitions 
            make it easier then a cave kiln to control the temperature. <BR> <br>
            "I used to fire with a climbing kiln. However, I needed more straightforward 
            fire force to bring my works closer to the old Bizen masterpieces. 
            I decided to recreate this 'Anagama (cave kiln)'in a similar style 
            to those old kilns built in the 16th century. I had to study the structure 
            all by myself from documents and the old, surviving kilns themselves. 
            <BR> <br>
            I'm still learning to fully understand the characteristics of 'Anagama 
            (cave kiln).' There are no masters left to ask for advice, so I learn 
            mainly from my own 'hands-on' experience. <BR> <br>
            Normally, in the climbing kiln, the front line is the best seat, so 
            potters put their best work there. But I learnt that the dynamism 
            of fire works differently in the cave kiln. I see it more like the 
            flow of water in a river. From the surface, the strongest force appears 
            to be occurring at the rock where the stream hits, but inside the 
            water, it is actually right behind the rock where the current caused 
            by the rock hits the main flow. <BR> <br>
            Similarly, the best spot in a cave kiln is behind the first line where 
            the convicted fire force and straight forward fire force meets." <BR>
