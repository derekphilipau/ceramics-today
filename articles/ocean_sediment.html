              </b>by Joan Lederman<p><img src="../images/clickable.gif" width="85" height="54"></p>
            <p><a href="images/ocean_sediment/blue_rimbowl_front.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/blue_rimbowl_front.jpg" width="225" height="180" border="0" align="left"></a>Communities 
              of organisms, dead and alive, have settled in layers on the ocean 
              floor and are sometimes taken by researchers as core samples. Occasionally, 
              I get their excess. I learned that most samples melt into a glaze 
              at cone 10 and 11.</p>
            <p>They each have a character of their own. While the glazes that 
              humans have concocted are often exquisite... they have a different 
              voice. They are more contrived from nature than they are released 
              by nature. I achieve my results by thinning the mud-like <a href="http://www.thesoftearth.com/pages/ocean_sediments.html"><b>ocean
              sediments </b></a>with fresh water and applying them like any glaze. 
              Many make branching patterns like river deltas, our brains, and 
              some potters say, like ash glazes. They appear to flow downward 
              while crystallizing upward. Some look waxy and thick, and some look 
              glassy and liquid.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/ocean_sediment/rectangle_sampl.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/rectangle_sampl.jpg" width="250" height="180" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/ocean_sediment/GardenofEden.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/GardenofEden.jpg" width="297" height="180" hspace="1" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>How might this be useful to other potters? A potter with persisting 
              interest could find out which institutions send ships out to collect 
              cores. Possibly a Google search on coring would offer names of all 
              the archives in the world and approaching one by one might turn 
              up some samples. </p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/ocean_sediment/eyebowl2.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/eyebowl2.jpg" width="229" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/ocean_sediment/lld-p003.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/lld-p003.jpg" width="189" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>I began this process when a sample arrived at my door and the kiln 
              was on, so I stuffed some into a spy hole. It melted. The next test 
              was a bisque firing and in a third test sediment was thinned with 
              water and applied to clay. That&#8217;s when I discovered <a href="http://www.thesoftearth.com/pages/foraminifera.html"><b>foraminifera</b></a>
              - small calcium carbonate shells which science uses to date materials. 
              In nine years of using these materials, I observed that sediments 
              with foraminifera usually make branching patterns. So far, no sediments 
              from the Pacific Ocean have made branching patterns.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/ocean_sediment/NotMomsUrn.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/NotMomsUrn.jpg" width="206" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/ocean_sediment/rusticlevase.jpg"><img src="images/ocean_sediment/thumbs/rusticlevase.jpg" width="206" height="180" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve used materials from various <a href="http://www.thesoftearth.com/pages/places.html"><b>locations</b></a>,
              including the Arabian Sea, the Dead Sea, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, 
              the Bering Straits and the Black Sea, the Indian Ocean, Pacific 
              Ocean, Southern Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, as well as materials 
              from hydrothermal vents and crust slurry from the mid-Atlantic Ridge 
              crust. I&#8217;ve also learned that magma within the Earth, which 
              takes many forms after volcanic eruptions, and land samples in Iceland, 
              are similar to those in Hawaii. This should come as no surprise, 
              since we all do float on the same core.</p>

            <p align="left">I live in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA. It is a 
              deep-water port and home to many research institutions, including 
              the <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/"><b>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</b></a>, 
              which is how I happened to receive these materials. I mark the source 
              locations on the pots, so the stories are accessible to people. 
              Many photos of pieces are available as food for the eyes on my website 
              <a href="http://www.thesoftearth.com"><b>The Soft Earth</b></a>.</p>
            <p><img src="images/ocean_sediment/Joan_Lederman.jpg" width="125" height="125" align="left">If 
              anyone out there would like to continue this type of work, or wants 
              to undertake an applied interdisciplinary program at a university, 
              I would love to see more people doing it... and will help by sharing 
              my knowledge. I am interested in hearing from you, if further discoveries 
              result from someone having read about my work, in partnership with 
              the Great Mother Earth. She is a good teacher for me. Joan may be
