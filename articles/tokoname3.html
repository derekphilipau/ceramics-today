            <p><b>Changes in Tokoname Ceramics</b><br>
              The origins of Japanese pottery go back to Sueki in the 5th century 
              AD and the influences which have had an impact on Japanese Pottery 
              have come from Buddhism culture and the Ancient Chinese civilization. 
              These influences in their turn were instrumental in the development 
              of green glazed pottery, &quot;sansai&quot; or three colored glaze 
              and ash glazed pottery.</p>
            <p> In the 12th century Japanese society changed from the Ancient 
              Period and moved into the Middle Ages. It was around that time that 
              pottery first made its appearance in Tokoname. Ash glazed pottery 
              was the typical type of pottery produced at the time as a direct 
              consequence of contact with the Sanage Kiln near Nagoya, a main 
              center for ash glazed pottery. In the hills of the Chita Peninsula 
              many kilns began to operate at the same time. These kilns which 
              were the forerunners of the &quot;anagama&quot; worked from the 
              12th to the 14th century. The pieces produced at this time have 
              been denominated &quot;Ko Tokoname&quot; or Old Tokoname ware. These 
              pieces were free from superfluous decoration and were noted for 
              their simplicity and robust execution and are today highly prized 
              for the naturalness of form. The pieces were characterized by a 
              light brown color and a natural green ash glaze on the shoulder 
              of the pots which were a breakthrough compared to the production 
              typical of the time.</p>
            <p> In the 15th century the kilns in the Chita peninsula area began 
              to be concentrated in Tokoname and to be fired near villages. The 
              size of the kilns began to experience a rapid change in terms of 
              size. As a consequence large pots began to be produced. These pots 
              were mainly very large storage jars. In the 16th century the main 
              thrust of production pottery in such centers as Seto, Mino, Bizen, 
              Shigaraki and Tamba were wares for the Tea Ceremony but Tokoname 
              was the exception in that it continued producing the usual pieces 
              as before.</p>
            <p>From the 17th to the early 19th century (The Edo era) ceramic production 
              changed considerably and was essentially concentrated on teawares, 
              flower vases and pottery related to the production of sake in Tokoname. 
              During this time the name of the potters first made its appearance 
              on the pieces. At the end of the Edo era the &quot;Ogama&quot; was 
              the typical type of kiln in use and in addition to this the &quot;Noborigama&quot; 
              or climbing kiln began to operate as well. It was also at this time 
              the production of the &quot;Shudei&quot; teapot went into operation. 
              This type of pottery is still standard to this day. Before that 
              the teapot was imported from China because the production technology 
              was unavailable to the potters of Tokoname.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the 19th century, Japan went through a period 
              of rapid industrialization and this greatly influenced the production 
              of pottery in Tokoname. This led to the introduction of mass production 
              which was used in the manufacture of ceramic pipes, building materials 
              such as roof and floor tiles and material for cladding buildings, 
              sanitary ware and vessels for the storage of &quot;shochu&quot; 
              (Distilled rice wine). The ceramic tradition made a dramatic change 
              from small scale domestic production to an industrial scale of manufacturing 
              for a mass market. The traditional pieces being produced at this 
              time (unglazed teawares and flower vases) also the shudei and sencha 
              pieces (made exclusively for green tea) went into full scale production. 
              In Tokoname glazed ware (as opposed to the natural ash glazes before) 
              began to appear at this time. Carving as a popular decorative technique 
              began to have a strong influence and had its origins in the popular 
              traditions of the West at that time. Coal fired kilns began to replace 
              the traditional wood fired kilns at the beginning of the 20th century. 
              At the end of the 19th century more and more ceramic production 
              was directed towards export for the first time. For a while the 
              large vases made of shudei clay with the dragon motif formed the 
              bulk of the export wares but this soon went out of fashion. The 
              next item to be of major importance was biscuit fired pieces with 
              Japanese lacquer together with ceramic toys and ornaments. These 
              innovations set the pattern of production which prevailed until 
              the Second World War.</p>
            <p>Further improvements in industrial production soon after the War 
              meant that gas,electricity and oil became the major source of power 
              in the production of pottery in Tokoname. In the ceramic field the 
              potters active at the time were influenced by the traditions of 
              the Arts and Crafts Movement and European avant-garde and as a result 
              a new movement surfaced. In the traditional field there was a revival 
              in traditional techniques which saw the appearance of Old Tokoname 
              style pottery and the revival of traditional firing techniques.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the 20th century the production of pottery on 
              Tokoname shows a great diversity due to the great variety of influences 
              and the 900 year history of ceramics in Tokoname. </p>
