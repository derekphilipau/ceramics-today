              firing can be termed a 'primitive' firing technique, although this 
              is not meant in a derogotory way. The word 'traditional' can certainly 
              also be used in the case of many cultures, that were amongst the 
              first to discover this simple firing technique. It is still widely 
              used on many continents today, but it the sort of thing you can 
              <a href="../howto/htpitfire.html"><b>easily do in your own backyard</b></a>
              and it enjoys popularity with some studio potters. Early cultures 
              found clay in the ground and must have discovered its fired qualities 
              by accident, probably discovering some burnt clay in a camp fire. 
              This very basic firing then evolved into the <a href="http://www.nativetech.org/pottery/firing.html"><b>pit-firing</b></a>.
            <p>Not all clays are suitable to use in such a firing, especially 
              the more refined types available from suppliers. Additions of grog 
              'open up' the clay and make it more resisitant to heat shock. Clays 
              dug directly from the earth may be suitable 'as is', or might profit 
              from additions of grog or volcanic ash, which also resists severe 
              temperature differences. If using a commercial clay, get a clay 
              suitable for raku firings. The best color results can be achieved 
              with iron bearing, or red clays. It is a good idea to bisque fire 
              the work first, as this helps to prevent shattering and cracking. 
              Pit-fired work is usually not glazed but rather burnished before 
              the bisque, or decorated with washes of black or red iron oxide, 
              copper carbonate and mixtures of these, after bisque. Color effects 
              can also be achieved by spreading oxides and carbonates around the 
              pieces (particularly copper carbonate), which volatilise and result 
              in flashes of color appearing on the fired work. Similar effects 
              can be achieved by wrapping copper wire around a pot. 
            <p><b>Raku</b></p>
            <p>Raku originated in Japan in the 16th century, where raku vessels 
              were and still are used in the traditional <a href="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/teae.html"><b>tea 
              ceremony</b></a>. It is a low-fire technique, where bisqued work 
              is quickly heated to red hot temperature and then taken out of the 
              kiln and reduced in wood shavings, newspaper or a similar combustible 
              material. Raku ware is decorated with low-fire glazes, which usually 
              contain a lot of frit. The clays used for this firing technique 
              contain a high percentage of grog, so the work will be able to withstand 
              the high temperature fluctuations, although this doesn't mean that 
              other clays can't be used. 
            <p> Raku ware may be sculptural, like some of the work of William 
              K. Turner, handbuilt, or wheel-thrown, like the works of Jack &amp; 
              Cindy Philips. 
            <p> Raku, with its battle with the elements of fire and smoke is an 
              exciting technique, one that is suited to communal firings, as many 
              dedicated workshops can testify. While it is an age-old tradition 
              from Japan, it has found many devout followers in western ceramic 
              communities.
