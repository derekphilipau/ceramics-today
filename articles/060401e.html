            <ul>
              <li> <i>Total Plant Concepts</i><br>
                Shorter firing cycles, better heat distribution, better insulation, 
                better car and cassette design, better loading and unloading facility 
                design etc.. all contribute to savings at the expense of higher 
                initial capital cost. Throughputs of 20,000 to 45,000 pieces or 
                more per day justify intense research on these concepts. Annual 
                rates of 200,000 tons are noted. 
                <p> Of course it is critical for economy of scale that these plants 
                  are run frequently without stoppages. The burners are typically 
                  turned down not off although rapid heat ups are possible from 
                  cold in the furnace zone but the extra heat shock and heat loss 
                  in the cars etc.. can be costly if the plant is stopped. Shifts 
                  of 7 day, 20 hours per day are common. Cars are typically good 
                  RI bricks with fiber covering wherever possible. In some countries, 
                  bricks would need to be redesigned due to the lack of surface 
                  area available to exhaust the water and the carbon. Maximum 
                  carbon content would be around 1.5 to 3% with free silica less 
                  than 25%. Handling of the product deserves attention to minimize 
                  breakage's and excessive handling. The loading and unloading 
                  from the extruded to the drying car is done by either suction 
                  pods or silicon type "fingers". 
                <p> There is a "buffer" section between the manufacture, dryer 
                  and kiln and this provides a safety net to ensure the process 
                  is not stopped or all the parts are sufficiently dried. The 
                  buffer can be extra heating or a mechanism to off load a faulty 
                  cart. To ensure the products are not out of line, infrared detectors 
                  are used to line up the cars and reject loads before entering 
                  the dryer. 
                <p> The modern plant and both roller hearth and tunnel kilns are 
                  very expensive and also call for a continuous expenditure program 
                  on the maintenance of the apparatus. High tabor costs justify 
                  this investment in high wage countries. Minimum throughputs 
                  are required and many smaller plants are shutting, merging or 
                  committing to this upgrade as their competitors achieve greater 
                  economies of scale and higher efficiencies. <br>
                  <br>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <p><i>Remote Area Plants</i><br>
                  A plant in a remote area needs to have the following desirable 
                  features: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Minimal capital cost 
                  <li>Low maintenance equipment 
                  <li>Low thermal mass 
                  <li>Low transport costs 
                  <li>Easy serviceability 
                  <li>High efficiency 
                  <li>Greater flexibility than larger plants firing a variety 
                    of products, with shorter working cycles <br>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                As tabor costs will be expected to be lower, it is possible to 
                achieve similar economies with modern plants by utilizing"older" 
                technologies. Intermittent kiln designs such as the single or 
                dual truck or portable cover would fulfill the above requirements. 
                The burners would still need to be sealed higher velocity types 
                to achieve consistent product and accurate temperature control 
                and combustion product monitoring would be desirable. Recirculation 
                of the exhaust heat to recuperators, regenerators and/or for drying 
                must be installed. Gas firing should be considered as oils or 
                other products would increase maintenance, produce inefficient 
                firing and be more difficult to control. A typical batch type 
                firing using high velocity burners could be to 950&deg; C in 2-3 
                hours, to 1150&deg; C in 3 hours, hold for 1 hour then down to 
                650&deg; C. The efficiency of the plant is paramount and if a 
                second car can be loaded and brought back to temperature as quickly 
                as possible there will be less heat loss. Flue exits at 120° C 
                with kiln exit at 40° C. Loading and unloading facilities and 
                conveyor systems are critical for more consistent product and 
                rapid kiln firing turnarounds. Rapid die changes for various product 
                type should be considered. </li>
