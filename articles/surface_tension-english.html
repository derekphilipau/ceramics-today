                <p> <b>Gibbs' Theorem:</b> <br>
                  According to the principles of thermodynamics, the elements 
                  which make up the surface layer of a solution and those of its 
                  mass are different. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Surface Tension: </b><br>
                  It is a force resulting from cohesiveness, which lowers to a 
                  minimum the number of molecules on the surface of a liquid. 
                  This creates a kind of invisible enveloppe which occupies the 
                  smallest possible surface. The surface tension represents the 
                  force of the film on the liquid surface. <br>
                  When one applies this principle to a minerals suspension, one 
                  can observe that the surface tension of water creates on the 
                  surface a layer which contains the finest particles of the suspension. 
                  This layer is very thin and created spontaneously. </p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS1a-eng.gif" width="356" height="203"></p>
                <p><b>Application to an isolated drop of the suspension</b>: <br>
                  A drop is a volume of insulated liquid whose cohesion is ensured 
                  by the forces of surface tension. In the absence of external 
                  influence, the drops have a spherical form. </p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS2a-eng.gif" width="380" height="162"></p>
                <p> <br>
                  Thus if one applies this reasoning to a drop of this suspension, 
                  the finest particles come to cover the surface of this one and 
                  leave in the centre a mass of a suspension richer in large particles. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Influence of drop size:</b> <br>
                  Surface of a sphere: 4 p R2 <br>
                  Volume of a sphere: 4/3 p R3 <br>
                  Ratio surface / volume: 4 p R2 / 4/3 p R3 = 3 / R <br>
                  <br>
                  The ratio of the surface compared to the volume is 3 times the 
                  inverse of the radius of the sphere, which means that the volume 
                  of a drop (sphere) is reduced more quickly than its surface 
                  when its radius decreases. <br>
                  Ex: drops of 1 mm of radius will have a ratio surface/volume 
                  of 3 cm&sup2; per ml of suspension while drops of 0.5 mm of 
                  radius will have a ratio surface/volume of 6 cm&sup2; per ml 
                  of suspension.</p>
                <p> Thus, for increasingly small drops formed from a suspension 
                  of minerals, these will present an increasingly significant 
                  differential of composition between the minerals of the surface 
                  and those of their mass (heart of the drops). The force of the 
                  surface tension exerting on the surface will impoverish more 
                  and more the mass of its finest minerals, since the volume of 
                  the drops decrease more quickly than their surface. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Glazing </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Glazing by spraying:</b> <br>
                  The principle is to disperse a suspension of drops in the air 
                  in order to direct those towards the surface of the ware to 
                  be glazed. The strong dispersion of the suspension helping with 
                  better controlling the application.</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS3-eng.gif" width="340" height="277"> 
                </p>
                <p> <br>
                  The drops pile up on the surface and form a layer</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li> If the shard is very porous, the drops 
                    will be solidified progressively as they settle and will form 
                    a powdery heap. </li>
              <li>
               If the shard is less porous or if the flow 
                    of pulverization is too important the drops will have time 
                    to form a &quot;wet&quot; layer leaving time necessary to 
                    the partial reorganization of particles under the effect of 
                    surface tension forces. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS4a-eng.gif" width="392" height="271"></p>
            <p><b>Glazing by dipping:</b><br>
              One dips the porous shard to be glazed in a bath of glaze in suspension 
              in water. The capillarity forces of the shard make it possible for 
              the water to penetrate into this one, attracting and thus plating 
              minerals of the solution on the porous surface. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS5a-eng.gif" width="380" height="283"></p>
            <p> <br>
              The case of dipping differs much from spraying. The layer deposited 
              by capillarity on the shard is partly made up of the finest particles 
              attracted onto the surface of the bath by the force of surface tension 
              of the suspension. These finest and very mobile particles wrap the 
              dipped ware as it progressively penetrates the glaze bath. <br>
              <br>
              They form, just like a clay slip on the plaster of a mould, a &quot; 
              super fine casting skin &quot;. But in the case of dipping this 
              &quot; super fine casting skin &quot; is inserted between the shard 
              and the external glaze coat made up of the particles of the mass, 
              larger in size and denser. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS6c-eng.gif" width="380" height="263"></p>
            <p> <br>
              <b>Influence of the glazing method on the behavior of the glaze: 
              </b><br>
              The two methods quoted on this page lead to different results during 
              firing of the glaze. The forces of surface tension play a dominating 
              role in the results by allowing a layout and a different selection 
              of the particles deposited on the shard. The aspect of the fired 
              layer and the dynamics of its fusion during firing will be different 
              according to the method used. <br>
              Thus for the same composition of a glaze (identical minerals in 
              same the proportions) fired in an identical cycle of firing one 
              will be able to observe: <br>
              <br>
              <b>1) Spraying:</b> <br>
              <br>
              a) powdered layer: <br>
              <br>
              The powdered layer is made up of glaze granules of different sizes, 
              each one covered by a thin layer of fine particles. The fine particles 
              melt in the first place and quickly attack the mass of less bulky 
              drops. Thus small drops melt before the largest and start the heterogeneous 
              fusion of the glaze, forming fusible points distributed in all the 
              mass of the product. <br>
              These fusible points accelerate the fusion of slightly larger drops 
              located near their vicinity and so on. It follows a phenomenon of 
              reticulation of the layer leading to clusters in large viscous molten 
              drops. This discontinuous layer is permeable and allows gases located 
              in the shard to escape easily. <br>
              With temperature rising, the forces of surface tension are slowly 
              slackened, making it possible to clusters to join and form a continuous 
              layer. This last phase in general makes it possible to obtain glaze 
              healing over by carrying out a stage of firing at the highest temperature 
              during a certain time. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS7-eng.gif" width="374" height="154"><br>
              <img src="images/surface_tension/TS8-eng.gif" width="337" height="215"> 
            </p>
            <p> <br>
              <b>b) Wet layer of sprayed glaze:</b> <br>
              <br>
              The wet layer is a tangle of drops whose continuity produced in 
              the upper part at the time of wetting made it possible that the 
              finest particles form a layer under the action of the forces of 
              surface tension. Thus part of the fine particles had the time to 
              organize on the surface of the layer and form a smooth and compact 
              &quot;skin&quot;. <br>
              During firing, this compact surface layer will begin to melt before 
              the whole of the layer and will undergo strong contractions under 
              the effect of shrinking and the high surface tension of the glaze 
              in formation. The under-layers being at a stage of less advanced 
              softening, the cohesion of this not very homogeneous mixture will 
              allow ruptures of the layer in fusion leading to cracks and retractions. 
              <br>
              These discontinuities of the layer of the glaze will allow gases 
              to escape. Then the temperature continuing to rise, the whole will 
              end up forming a continuous layer and heal over. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS9-eng.gif" width="358" height="198"></p>
            <p> <br>
              <b>2) Dipping: </b><br>
              <br>
              The layer of the finest particles in direct contact with the shard 
              will melt in first place. The strong cohesion of the shard will 
              prevent the retraction of the softened layer and this one will form 
              a relatively continuous and tight envelope. The gases which will 
              want to escape the shard will have trouble to find a way through 
              the layer of the glaze and will accumulate. <br>
              If the layer of the glaze is thin, discontinuities (small holes) 
              will let gases leave more erasily. <br>
              If it is thick, discontinuities will be rare and the pressure of 
              the gases will rise up to reach and exceed the bearable limit of 
              the layer of the glaze strongly softened by temperature. Large bubbles 
              will explode on the surface, producing craters of a few millimetres. 
            </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/surface_tension/TS10-eng.gif" width="380" height="162"></p>
            <p> <br>
              For this reason, the pieces produced by dipping will have to be 
              subjected to a rigorous control of the thicknes of the glaze, especially 
              if the shard produces gases during firing. A very detailed attention 
              will have to be paid to the granulometry and the grinding of the 
              glaze. </p>
