<p> Compounds: 
            <ul>
              <li><b>cadmium oxide </b> 
              <li><b>cadmium carbonate </b> 
              <li><b>cadmium chloride </b>

            <p> <b>Uses:</b><br>
              The metal is used in electroplating, in solder for aluminium, as 
              a constituent of easily fusible alloys, as a deoxidizer in nickel 
              plating, in process engraving, in cadmium-nickel batteries, and 
              in reactor control rods. Cadmium compounds are employed as TV phosphors, 
              as pigments in glazes and enamels, in dyeing and printing, and in 
              semi-conductors and rectifiers. 
            <p> <b>Exposure:</b><br>
              Inhalation 
            <p> <b>Toxicology: </b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Cadmium oxide fume is a severe pulmonary irritant; cadmium dust 
                is a less potent irritant than cadmium fume because it has a larger 
                particle size. Chronic exposure is associated with nephrotoxicity. 
                Several inorganic cadmium compounds cause malignant tumors in 
                animals. 
              <li>Inhalation exposure to high levels of cadmium fumes or dust 
                is intensely irritating to respiratory tissue. Particle size appears 
                to be a more important determinant of toxicity than chemical form. 
                However, most acute intoxications have been caused by inhalation 
                of cadmium fume at concentrations that did not provide sufficient 
                warning symtoms of irritation. Concentrations of fume responsible 
                for fatalities have been 40 to 50 mg/m3 for 1 hour or 9 mg/m3 
                for 5 hours. There has been non-fatal cases at lower concentrations. 
                Pulmonary symptoms and clinical signs reflect lesions ranging 
                from nasopharyngeal and bronchial irritation to pulmonary edema 
                with also possibly headache, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, 
                and diarrhea. Among survivors, the subsequent course is unpredictable; 
                most cases resolve slowly, but respiratory symptoms may linger 
                for several weeks, and impairment of pulmonary function may persists 
                for months. 
              <li>Long-term inhalation exposure at low levels leads to decreased 
                lung function and emphysema. 
              <li>Chronic exposure to cadmium results in renal damage which may 
                continue to progress even after exposure ceases. 
              <li>Other consequences of cadmium exposure are : 
                <ul>
                  <li>anemia 
                  <li>yellow discoloration of the teeth 
                  <li>rhinitis 
                  <li>occasional ulceration of the nasal septum 
                  <li>damage to the olfactory nerve 
                  <li>anosmia 
                </ul>
              <li>Chronic exposure to high levels of cadmium in food has caused 
                bone disorders, including osteoporosis and osteamalacia. Long 
                term ingestion, by a Japanese population, of water and food contaminated 
                with cadmium, was associated with a crippling condition, &quot;itai-itai&quot; 
                (ouch-ouch) disease. The affliction is characterized by pain in 
                the back and joints, osteomalacia (adult rickets), bone fractures, 
                and occasional renal failure, and most often affects women with 
                multiple risk factors such as multiparity and poor nutrition. 
              <li>Occupational exposure to cadmium has been implicated in a significant 
                increase of lung cancer. The IARC has determined that there is 
                sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of cadmium 
                and cadmium compounds. It also appears that cadmium has the capability 
                to alter genetic materials, particularly chromosomes. 
              <li>The 1995 ACGIH threshod limit value-time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) 
                for elemental cadmium and compounds as Cd is 0.01 mg/m3 for total 
                particulate dust (while it is 10mg/m3 for titanium dioxide in 
                Quebec); or 0.002 mg/m3 for the respirable fraction of dust,there 
                is an A 2 suspected human carcinogen designation for both forms. 
              <li>The urinary excretion of cadmium itself bears no known relationship 
                to the severity or duration of exposure and is only the confirmation 
                of absorption.Absorbed cadmium is retained in the body to a large 
                extent, and excretion is very slow. 
            </ul>
            The important thing is your level of exposure to cadmium, it may vary 
            if you are a pottery factory worker, a teacher, a full-time studio 
            potter or a part-time. It certainly depends also on the amount used 
            over a given period of time. In the wet state, these compounds are 
            certainly much less hazardous than as dust ( route of entry being 
            inhalation). Factories can afford the monitoring of cadmium exposure 
            but it is not the same for artists and craftpersons. So good housekeeping 
            of your studio is important. Avoidance of processes generating unnecessary 
            dust is also important, and the wearing of an approved dust mask when 
            the exposure seems hazardous is mandatory.
