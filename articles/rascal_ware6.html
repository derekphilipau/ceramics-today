            <p align="center"><b><a href="images/rascal_ware/canton_rascal.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/canton_rascal_sm.jpg" alt="Rascal Ware" width="328" height="195" border="0"></a></b></p>
            <p>It's not every day that we are honored with our own museum exhibition. 
              Of course, in accepting the invitation, we have also bought some 
              pressure. After all, we want to show only our best work. But there 
              are five of us here--Junior, Pilcher, Mosley, Hairy and me. While 
              I'm the famous one, the others are artistically and emotionally 
              involved and the question arises, &quot;Can we agree on what IS 
              our best work?&quot; These four guys really bear down, spouting 
              something about pressure making diamonds. I see it more as &quot;under 
              stress, they regress.&quot;</p>
            <p>If you watch them closely and ask a few questions, you'll find 
              that each comes to his love for ceramics from a different place. 
              For Hairy it's the only honest way he knows to make a living. For 
              Mosley it's an immersion in magic; he loves fire, chemicals and 
              watching clay thrown on a wheel. The fact that he can't do the latter 
              makes it all the more desirable. Pilcher is a recovering academic 
              who can't get past his first step. To him, no process or question 
              is too small to track down. Having made his discovery, he is then 
              compelled to talk about it, and at great length. Unfortunately, 
              he has more words than discoveries, so while I'm running the pottery, 
              he's running his mouth. By the law of averages, he does come up 
              with some great stuff. But even that's a black hole because, while 
              he'll tell you all about it, he won't tell you how he did it.</p>
            <p>Junior is the toughest case. He comes to ceramics as if it's a 
              religion. He is a born-again, fundamentalist, clay-thumping potter. 
              For him, Rascal Ware is a divine calling that guarantees dignity 
              and meaning with every breath, even if every breath is oxygen depleted. 
              He takes that as a sign to embrace reduction firing. Junior seeks 
              nothing less than the Kingdom of Clay, such as it might be, where 
              he and George Ohr will sit at the right hand of whomever. He shouldn't 
              hold his breath. It's rumored that Bernard Leach is still in purgatory 
              for condescending to . . . well, pretty much everyone.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am the power behind the thrown-that's not a typo. 
              Nor is it an exaggeration. By the strength of my personality, imagination 
              and wily fingers, I can play these guys like a piccolo - though 
              they would tell you I beat them like a drum. I remind them that 
              some men would pay for that kind of experience.</p>
            <p>What we have produced for the <a href="http://www.cantonart.org"><b>Canton 
              Museum of Art</b></a> is, of course, a collection of everybody's 
              strength. There are not that many seashells-score one for Georgette! 
              I call it the Rascal Ware Trifecta: &quot;Twos and Fews,&quot; &quot;Pete 
              and Re-Petes&quot;, and &quot;Inspired and Expired.&quot; You can 
              look at these works as pottery that is born of poetry, prose, biography 
              and our collective human condition. All of the pieces are driven 
              by the Rascal Ware Story, the first five chapters of which are on 
              display. You really should read them in order to understand what 
              you see. Some readers will discover truth and beauty. The truth 
              we build with a pitchfork; the beauty is just a skim coat. Further 
              clues to appreciating the Trifecta can be found in the world history 
              of ceramics, the Oedipus method of self-discovery and fulfillment, 
              the AARP magazine and our website, <a href="http://www.donpilcher.net"><b>www.donpilcher.net</b></a>. 
              I know that's a curious and ambiguous assortment of sources, but 
              remember, ambiguity is one of the touchstones of real art. </p>
