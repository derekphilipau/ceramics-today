                is 28 years since I visited the place where <a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/arakawa-toyozo.html"><b>Arakawa 
                Toyozo</b></a> lived and worked. As a recipient of a Myer Foundation 
                Geijutsu Fellowship I knew I was following the footsteps of many 
                before me. It wasn't the first time I had experienced the lure 
                of Japan: 18 years earlier, on a troop-carrier still with wartime 
                landing craft winched either side, we ferried back and forth to 
                Japan; but in those days there were restrictions on where one 
                was allowed to travel. Mia Jima, or Shrine Island as I knew it, 
                was accessible and it cast a life-long spell and the port of Kure 
                was interesting with its massive maritime shipbuilding facilities 
                still intact. Hiro is a smallish country town close by and family 
                treasures were being sold to occupation personnel to ease the 
                frugality of the times. It was there I bought my first pot. I 
                still have that Satsuma vase and have even traced its origin, 
                delighted to find that the pottery where it was made is still 
                in existence. They even knew when the pot was made by the quality 
                of the gold over-glaze. Back then I never knew that one day I 
                would make return visits, under my own steam these times, and 
                as a potter. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/moon1.jpg" alt="Moon's Anagama - work in progress" width="248" height="259" align="left"><b><a href="http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/koyama-fujio-jt.html">Fujio 
                Koyama</a></b> made the Arakawa visit possible. Not only did he 
                make the arrangements but supplied one of his apprentices to accompany 
                me. Invited into the Arakawa home I handled my first Arakawa tea 
                bowl then climbed up the hill to see the famous kiln that fellow 
                Australian Janet Barriskill was later to write about. At first 
                glance it was scarcely distinguishable from the surrounding rubble. 
                It captivated me and I vowed to make one like it, but never have. 
                The nearest I came was a far more respectable looking affair, 
                which only lasted a few years because where it was built was in 
                a country village, and only a hundred metres or so from the Country 
                Fire Service. Fires had almost devastated the area on more than 
                one occasion and the slightest sight or smell of smoke was cause 
                for alarm. During winter, when it should have been possible to 
                fire it without concern, proved difficult because of the unsuspected 
                presence of ground water draining from some nearby source and 
                saturating the hearth. Foolishly, in the early stages of construction 
                I hadn't dug out deeply under the hearth for a foundation of heavy 
                aggregate road metal and drainage rubble to be incorporated into 
                the plan. The wet conditions did produce some marvelousblack' 
                pots, but it was a struggle to get to temperature even when I 
                supplemented the firings with gas. The kiln was finally demolished 
                but the dream to build another one &shy; a real Arakawa one the 
                next time &shy; still persists. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/moon4.jpg" alt="Vase by Milton Moon" width="114" height="165" align="left">The 
                word '<a href="anagama.html"><b>anagama</b></a>' these days is
                a loosely used term when describing kiln types. My kiln was only 
                partially buried; the back half of the kiln was banked with earth 
                and rubble whereas the front was partially banked up to the kiln 
                entry, which was just large enough to crawl in and out. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                wasn't a proper plan drawn up. I knew the length and width of 
                the chamber size I wanted and, after roughly marking the shape 
                out on the ground, dug out a trench for the bottom row of bricks. 
                This was filled with heavy aggregate concrete and the bricks were 
                laid at the angle the walls were to be. I had decided on a catenary 
                arch structure and this determined the angle of the walls. I had 
                made four arch forms; these had been made the usual way, by hanging 
                a chain on a wall at the width and depth needed. Under the hanging 
                chain were sheets of newspaper on which were traced the curves 
                of the chain. This outline was transferred to scrap timber and 
                the arch shapes were formed. When the arch forms are located in 
                their positions you must chock them up about 5mm or so enabling 
                the chocks to be removed, for the forms to be lowered, after the 
                arch bricks are laid. It is also advisable to screw the forms 
                together so they can be disassembled inside the kiln to allow 
                easy removal after the bricklaying is completed. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                had a neighbour who was both potter and skilled worker in timber. 
                From scrap timber he cut me long lathes thin enough to bend. These 
                were laced over the basic arch supports. When you lace timber 
                this way it is surprising how strong the supporting structure 
                becomes. It was then a simple matter of deciding where the door 
                should be, making an arch and putting it in place. The rest was 
                simple brick laying, using scrap clay loaded with sand and grog 
                and also using wedges of harder clay to fill in the top gaps as 
                the bricks spread apart following the curve of the forms.3 At 
                rear of the kiln I had determined the flue size needed and, at 
                the front, the size of the firebox. As LP gas was to be used as 
                both an initial and supplementary fuel to the wood, a large chimneystack 
                wasn't really necessary. Firing this way made the task much less 
                arduous although there were times when I enjoyed the help of some 
                volunteers to ease the burden of stoking. Having gas also meant 
                that on occasions I could choose quite green and sappy eucalyptus 
                to get some marvelous colour flashes from complex hydrocarbons 
                and timber gums without dropping temperature. Purists might find 
                the practice of using both gas and wood not all that authentic 
                but we must make the choices that suit our individual situations. 
                One good point about using the two fuels together is that ash 
                is almost blown on to the ware, especially when you stir up the 
                ash bed. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                firebox was a simple affair but it was quite large for such a 
                small kiln and it was possible to fire with wood only if desired. 
                The bagwall was chequered and this allowed some direct flames 
                on the front-stacked pots. The flue exit at the back could be 
                blocked with a brick to cut down the size if necessary. On this 
                particular kiln I was able to control reduction by using a broken 
                kiln shelf to close down the top of the stack, although on other 
                kilns I have built it was possible to devise a damper built into 
                the bottom of the stack. If I was using both fuels at once it 
                was possible to bring about reduction just by introducing green 
                timber. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                are basic rules to be followed in kiln-building and one I subscribe 
                to is 'keep it simple'. During my <a href="anagama.html"><b>woodfiring</b></a>
                learning days I recall discussing one particular kiln with the 
                late John Chappell, during his fateful trip to Australia from 
                Japan. I had found it impossible to get above a certain temperature 
                and was almost in despair. He solved the problem in half a minute 
                and gave me the best lesson I could have at that time. His advice 
                was: Avoid complicated designs and make sure that bagwall heights 
                and flue exits and chimney height can be altered without having 
                to engage in massive rebuilding. It was good advice. The next 
                best advice I received about woodfiring was, Don't choke your 
                ash-pit, keep your stoked fuel both loose and open and always 
                keep a trace of smoke coming out the chimney; that way you know 
                your temperature is more likely to be going up, not down. There 
                are other fireboxes that are more labor-saving and there is no 
                shortage of plans. But if you want to enjoy the thought of a contest 
                with a fairly rudimentary kiln, this small one I built could be 
                a good start. You might also learn about woodfiring at the same 
                time. But few things in life are as easy as they sound.</font></p>
