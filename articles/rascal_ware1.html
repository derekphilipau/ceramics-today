            <p align="center"><b>Georgette Ore and Rascal Ware - Chapter 1</b></p>
            <p>Georgette Ore is vague about her age and her past except to say 
              that she was born in the South and grew up on the Gulf. A guess 
              puts her somewhere between middle age and early retirement, depending 
              on the light and the time of day.</p>
            <p>She has worked in the pottery field for some time, moving frequently 
              and living an artist&#8217;s life as America&#8217;s perpetual guest. 
              Ms. Ore explains that the recent bent of her pottery has been inspired 
              by a line from the classic motion picture, <i>The Graduate</i>, 
              wherein it is suggested to Benjamin that the future is in plastics. 
              She treats her clay as if it were plastic; heated and malleable. 
              Her pottery appears off handed and, to some eyes, even inept. Yet 
              upon careful examination it is clear that each vessel begins as 
              an exquisitely wheel thrown piece of work which is then animated 
              and transformed by the power of her imagination and her wily fingers.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore1.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore1.jpg" width="201" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore2.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore2.jpg" width="201" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Ms. Ore has remained single, but admits to having a fondness for 
              her new employer, Junior Bucks. They met on the Internet in a feldspar 
              chat room.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bucks founded the Rascal Ware Pottery several years ago. To 
              date, this venture has enjoyed no particular success. He recently 
              hired Ms. Ore in an attempt to turn Rascal Ware into &#8220;well&#8230;something 
              desirable&#8221;. As to her inspiration concerning &#8220;plastics&#8221;, 
              Mr. Bucks says that while this may be true, he himself has noticed 
              a profound change in Ms. Ore&#8217;s work since she began taking 
              a prescribed medication on a daily basis. He also reports that she 
              no longer complains about the heat in the studio. Good thing, that. 
              Always a gentleman, Mr.Bucks has no comment on her wily fingers.</p>
            <p>Ms. Ore has been asked if she knows of, or is related to, the famous 
              American potter, George Ohr. She says that one side of her family 
              has a legend that there is a connection between the Ores and the 
              Ohrs. The discrepancy in spelling is attributed to the Immigration 
              Service, an alcohol treatment sanitarium, or unregulated voting 
              practices in a large rural county, all depending on who is telling 
              the story. At best, she figures she could be a grand niece, once 
              removed by a second marriage. Nothing to brag on there. Commenting 
              on the similarities of their pottery, she observes that Rascal Ware 
              is to George Ohr as Twain is to Poe. She won&#8217;t elaborate further.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore3.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore3.jpg" width="203" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore4.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/ore4.jpg" width="201" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>As to a life spent in the art pottery business, she thinks that 
              it is wonderful, but more complex and demanding than most people 
              recognize. &#8220;After all&#8221;, she says, &#8220;you can&#8217;t 
              really tell the difference between the theory of the post-modern 
              narrative and a good practical joke. Maybe there is no difference. 
              It&#8217;s just too ironic. Young artists and potters are drawn 
              to irony because it often signifies real content. But after you&#8217;ve 
              lived enough of it, you run the other way, because irony can also 
              suggest that the hand of God has been dealing from the bottom of 
              the deck. That&#8217;s an unpleasant thought; it tests my theology, 
              breaks my heart and gives me a headache. I&#8217;m better off sticking 
              with plastic clay and my wily fingers&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Ms. Ore averts her eyes when she talks about irony. One is left 
              to wonder if she intends to stick with Mr. Bucks.</p>
