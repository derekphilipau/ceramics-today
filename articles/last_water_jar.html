            <p> <img src="images/water_jar/image001.jpg" alt="Tharu water jar, nepal" width="163" height="240" align="left">Lightning 
              strikes dirt, blindingly fusing it into nature&#8217;s terra cotta, 
              changing its color to red, brown, orange, white, gray or black, 
              sometimes leaving behind strange fused bits of metal that are sought 
              as amulets. Potters have simulated and controlled this process since 
              before memory. The names for the parts of a pot -- lip, mouth, neck, 
              shoulder, belly, underbelly, foot -- are imbedded in the beginnings 
              of language. Although we have lost its everyday presence in our 
              electronic culture, the archetypal water jar is deeply integrated 
              our collective unconscious, and is remarkably similar around the 
              world, whether it is uncovered in an archaeological excavation in 
              Peru or in the street market in Kathmandu. Its nature is round or 
              ovoid, shell like, formed to meet hip or head, stretched as thin 
              as the clay permits the maker, fitted with a neck and mouth that 
              leads to a dark womb interior, and of a size that women can carry 
              comfortably. It is always unique to the neighborhood where it is 
              made &#8211; easily recognizable by its form and the way it resonates 
              sound. When it is gone from a culture, it means the extinction of 
              yet another simple function that brought people together in the 
              closely woven social net typical of the pre-industrial world.</p>
            <p>Symbolically, the potters&#8217; wheel as great god Vishnu&#8217;s 
              discus spins out the Hindu creation myth. As the universe was set 
              in motion, so is the soft clay first spun to the center of the wheel, 
              the primordial still point, where it naturally assumes the shape 
              of a linga -- the male principle. Next the potter opens a yoni -- 
              the female principle -- which is shaped like a womb and will become 
              pregnant with the potter&#8217;s creative energy. After this marriage, 
              he can birth any form. When held to the ear, water jars tell the 
              story of human endeavor on earth: the sound is like surf, complete 
              with echoes of gossip at the well, satisfied chatter in the kitchen, 
              warfare and suffering, great music and overheard intrigues. In Southeast 
              Asia, every village household still keeps a water jar -- the water 
              stays cool without refrigeration, is freshened by some mysterious 
              alchemical effect of the clay, and remains one of the few ritualized 
              connections to the past. The element water along with its container 
              have a major role in most religions.</p>
            
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image003.jpg" alt="Tharu potters on the road" width="161" height="240" align="left">I&#8217;ve 
              been involved with Asian potters since 1979; as a potter myself, 
              I&#8217;ve learned to listen to the song of the water jar from these 
              unassuming people, who live in villages that resonate every morning 
              to the sound of hundreds of pots being beaten into form by craftspeople 
              who know precisely when the pot is finished by the sound it produces. 
              In particular, I work closely with Tharu (&#8220;Tah-roo&#8221;) 
              people, a large and very old ethnic group in the lowlands of southern 
              Nepal. Nobody knows their origins. When the government of Nepal 
              eradicated malaria in the 1950&#8217;s, freeing up thousands of 
              square miles for agricultural use (and inevitable deforestation), 
              most of the Tharus, who had no system of land ownership, were disenfranchised 
              when &#8220;their&#8221; land was distributed as political favors. 
              These northerners cut down the jungle, worshipped different gods, 
              and claimed land that the Tharus, in their innocence, never knew 
              could be owned. The area is called Deokhuri, and is ruled benevolently 
              by a feudal Lord who lives in a rambling stucco palace with at least 
              70 extended family members and retainers. It is the same scale as 
              the palace in which the Buddha was raised, just two days' walk from 
              here (and about four hours by car, if the roads were ever in good 
              condition).<br>
              <br>
              <i><b>Almost out <br>

            <p>Over 600 potters live in this wide valley, in long, thatched houses 
              that appear to be rooted in the ground -- their roofs come down 
              so low -- semicircular door openings breaking the edge. Men must 
              stoop down to enter the cave-like dark of the interior. At the end 
              of the rainy season, the houses are camouflaged by rampant squash 
              vines, which supply both shade and nourishment, and are safely out 
              of hungry animals' reach. So much are they of the earth, villages 
              create only a small textural anomaly on the vast expanse of flood 
              plain, complex in its drainages and forests and fields. </p>
            
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image005.jpg" alt="Potter's house with chili peppers, sari drying on roof, pottery drying" width="159" height="240" align="left">Nobody 
              in the valley can remember when they were not potters. They continue 
              to provide the necessary ceramic containers for this old culture 
              that spreads over Southwestern Nepal and into northern India. These 
              people call themselves Tharu, and lived for centuries as a nondestructive 
              part of the lowlands ecology, their population held in balance by 
              climate and disease. Each Tharu house has a special alcove for the 
              gods. There are clay horses and there is the first clay man.</p>
            <p> The landscape appears simple and flat when seen from a distance 
              -- its horizon articulated by surrounding low hills and distant 
              hints of snow peaks. But walking through it is indirect, diverted 
              by unforeseen complexities of waterways, rice plantation and bamboo 
              groves, which curve the road around all the places a man cannot 
              walk. Dirt tracks, dug with simple hand tools and maintained by 
              village volunteers as a form of direct taxation, are smoothed by 
              the feet of humans and animals, and in recent years, a couple of 
              motorized vehicles a day. Large herds of bullocks are sent out every 
              morning to graze and produce dung -- a valuable multi-purposed substance 
              used for fertilizer, architecture and fuel. Fresh cow dung contains 
              albumin -- an excellent glue and binder -- and fiber, both of which 
              contribute to the strength and water resistance of mud applied to 
              the woven reed mats that define house walls. At &#8220;cow time&#8221; 
              every evening, the herd returns with its cloud of dust.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes dust and sometimes mud.</p>

            <p>Entering a Tharu long house requires bending low, but once inside, 
              there is a feeling of spaciousness, reaching up to the darkness 
              under the peak of the roof. The space is divided sculpturally into 
              bedrooms, kitchen and storage, by monumental clay and cow dung grain 
              containers that grow from the floor up to head height. In the dark 
              interior, they have the presence of guardians. Above these, bunches 
              of hanging objects punctuate the dark -- baskets, dry corn, implements 
              that in their unfamiliarity stimulate imagined purposes.</p>

            <p><i><b>&#8220;You know &#8211; our own things&#8230;&#8221;</b></i></p>
            
            <p>Varying amounts of food, work, rest, water, ritual and alcohol 
              are the main features of everyday life. Whether Tharus live or die 
              depends on the grace and power of their gods, who, like Nepal itself, 
              are stressed by the increasing number of evil spirits and foreign 
              devils that are entering their world. Darkness is kept at bay just 
              outside the village boundary, where the guardians&#8217; shrine 
              stands outside a mango grove. It is activated by the frequent cycles 
              of ceremony that are necessary to keep the universe in balance. 
              Earth, water, fire, air and space -- the makings of a water jar 
              and a universe.</p>
            
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image010.jpg" alt="The potters&#8217; wheel weighs over 100 kilos" width="320" height="212" align="left">Strong-backed 
              women balancing jars on their heads gather at the well with its 
              four corner posts, carved as deities, gossiping while they wait 
              their turn to run the bucket down on its rope. Gods control both 
              water and gossip; perhaps water jars carry the gossip home to whisper 
              it from their seats in the earthen floor to the cooking fire in 
              its clay tripod. Squatting, the women feed the fire and stir the 
              terra cotta cooking pots. These pots are only made by women; they 
              form them without a wheel, in ritual unison, at the same time of 
              year, and fire them in their back yards. At meal time, the rice 
              tastes of smoke and talk. </p>
            <p>As sharecroppers forced to give half the crop to their Lord, men 
              must earn more rice by making pottery as much as possible, using 
              enormous wheels shaded by small huts. This is how to make a potters' 
              wheel: Start by crossing two timbers of sal wood, hard and heavy 
              and four feet long. Wrap split bamboo around this cross to make 
              a circle. Then mix clay, straw, rice hulls, cow dung, goat hair 
              and molasses to form the great disc.</p>
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image012.jpg" alt="Saligram stone -- fossilized ammonite" width="179" height="239" align="left">If 
              you wait a year or two, one of the fast-talking traders who has 
              been with the wild men in the mountains will pass by, bringing rare 
              and wonderful things. They know a place in the high valleys, where 
              Vishnu has caused round black stones to be found in the river bed. 
              As the mountains come sliding and crashing down each rainy season, 
              the irresistible monsoon-swollen river carries, crushes and sorts 
              whatever it swallows -- mountain fragments, rocks, Vishnu's discus, 
              ancient and recent dust -- and tumbling black saligram stones. When 
              cracked open, they reveal Vishnu's spiral, as the positive and negative 
              of a fossilized snail shell, resurrected from its incalculably old 
              seabed, shoved up by Indian as it plows under China.</p>
            
            <p><br>
              Potters&#8217; wheels are manifestations of Vishnu, the union of 
              yoni and linga, the turning circle, the center and the circumference, 
              bound into unity by cow dung. This is a heavy load of symbolism 
              to turn around, and the wheel properly has one of these saligrams 
              as the pivot stone. </p>
            <p>Make a stake of ironwood, broad at the base to bury in the earth, 
              and pointed at the top to spin the saligram. Set in place and turned 
              with a stick placed in a depression on the circumference, this giant 
              top is ready to defy gravity for long minutes. The potter has magic 
              in his stick, whipping the wheel off the ground -- Vishnu&#8217;s 
              discus that spins his lump of mud into the world of hollow singing 
              forms. </p>
            
            <p>The seasonal pulse of agriculture coalesces energies. When fields 
              are dry, men dig clay and make pots to trade for rice, which is 
              eaten or preferably, made into beer for breakfast. If there is enough, 
              the beer is distilled into rakshi to blur hard reality a bit more. 
              When the fields are wet and pots won&#8217;t dry, men wait for the 
              rice to grow. Women work all the time. When a stranger comes, they 
              hide inside the house with their babies. </p>

              paddle and terra cotta anvil, some of them fully as big as the men 
              who drum their forms, expanding the clay until it is stretched as 
              thin as the shell of an ostrich egg. Water jars are never empty: 
              when they are not holding water, they contain sound; each standard 
              shape having its own resonant frequency, as if the potters scattered 
              throughout the village tune their jars to each other. After years 
              of use, the mushroom-shaped clay anvils that hold the curve against 
              the wooden paddle are as shiny as mirrors. In the Hindu creation 
              myths, sound was the first manifestation of the sentient world.</p>
            <p> Sun dries the clay. A group of pots is beaten in several stages 
              during a day, as the form slowly stiffens into finality. </p>
            
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image016.jpg" alt="Tharu firing house with pots ready for firing" width="320" height="212" align="left">Drying 
              pots are moved in and out of the sun for several days: into the 
              thatched pottery hut at night to protect them from dew, and back 
              out each morning, until there are enough to make a firing -- usually 
              several hundred pieces ranging from small water or rakshi pots about 
              seven inches in diameter, up to the big storage pots that may reach 
              two feet or more. Although the function, size and proportions of 
              each pot are standard from village to village, decoration identifies 
              the pot&#8217;s origins. Some villages impress designs with the 
              end sections of reeds, others make simple stippled bands; the most 
              elaborate are finger painted by the women.</p>
            <p> On the day of the firing, the pieces are coated with a shiny, 
              thin clay slip known as &#8220;gabij&#8221;, which adds beauty to 
              the surface and can be used for finger painting. This is the same 
              technology that was used all over the world before glazes were developed. 
              We are most familiar with it from Greek and Roman pottery. The process 
              of transforming clay back into stone is alchemical; firing is a 
              time of excitement and tension for potters in any country or historical 
              period. Even with modern state-of-the-art technology, there is still 
              mystery around what happens inside the kiln; too hot to feel, too 
              bright to see. The fire is managed, but not trustworthy. There is 
              always the potential of the fire getting out of our control and 
              destroying days of work. The fire master's job is a crucial one, 
              and he works with a combination of experience, magic, guesswork 
              and good hunches, tuning his intuition to the sound and subtle cues 
              of escaping moisture and quality of smoke.</p>
            
            <p>The floor of the communal firing house is layered with these great 
              brittle shells of clay, systematically stacked in an oval heap that 
              may be twenty or thirty feet in diameter and three to four feet 
              high, packed in the interstices with firewood. Miraculously, men 
              can walk on the load, as they cover it over with a mixture of clay 
              and straw. The result is a shiny, wet low mound which occupies most 
              of the firing house, waiting for the fire to dry it into a hard, 
              cracked crust at the end of the firing. </p>
            
            <p>As with all transformative events, a ritual offering is made to 
              the fire gods, and the officiating potter walks around the huge 
              stack, drawing a line in the clay circumference with his four fingers 
              -- this is to prevent the entry of malevolent spirits that can and 
              frequently do destroy pots. The fire is started from one side, and 
              by periodically opening vent holes with a pole, is guided inside 
              what looks like the world's biggest pie crust. A large firing may 
              take two days. The fire master dozes on a string bed by the firing, 
              waking every few hours to make more vent holes. The heap smokes; 
              now and again the crust breaks, revealing the red glow of embers 
              and seemingly transparent glowing walls of pots. These gaps are 
              covered by large floppy discs of clay and straw to conserve the 
              heat. The process is slow and deliberate, in keeping with all time 
              in the Tharu culture. Eventually, the fire has moved across the 
              heap and used up all its fuel. The pots cool for half a day.</p>

            <p><i><b>both empty waiting to be filled&#8221;</b></i></p>
            
            <p>At the time of unloading, everybody comes to see if the fire gods 
              were cooperative. It is usual to lose up to half of the products 
              in firing, depending on the vagaries of drying, wind, firewood, 
              and whatever stray or malignant spirits came wandering by. Call 
              the shaman to cure the problem; he knows the science of cause and 
              effect.</p>

            <p>In the open spaces in the village, stacks of identical water jars 
              identify potters&#8217; houses. Identical until you go to choose 
              one. The curves differ by millimeters; surfaces have been colored 
              by the fire&#8217;s tongue; but even in the dark there is one pot 
              that will stand out, perhaps because of its special resonance. Pots 
              in the market are tapped to make sure of their resonance: a cracked 
              pot sounds dead. But this is not the resonance I am getting at. 
              It is not a quality you can measure with an instrument: call it 
              magic, or devotion -- the product of a moment of synchronicity in 
              the potter&#8217;s life when all his skills, the weather, the mood 
              of the day, and the five elements came together in a small epiphany.</p>
            
            <p>As summer approaches, the heat builds for weeks, each day's tension 
              forming clouds, which fail to bring relief, except for occasional 
              disastrous winds that carry only enough rain to frustrate hope and 
              destroy firings. Finally, the sky swells with water from the South 
              and dumps it in great floods on the barren fields. Gratefully, the 
              people plant rice, which greens the valley floor, thriving on monsoon 
              fecundity.</p>
            
            <p><b><i>&quot;World of muck and green<br>
              struck by the sun bursting</i></b></p>
            <p><i><b>through dark sheets of hard-hitting rain</b></i></p>
            <p><i><b> boiling black sky&quot;</b></i></p>
            
            <p>The deluge persists during three months of skyburst when virtually 
              no work can be done. The roads are impassable, disease strikes, 
              and the people subsist on one bowl of rice gruel per day while the 
              water swells the next crop. At last the time of feasting comes, 
              followed by clay gathering and a renewal of the rhythm of pot making.</p>
            
            <p>In the time that started before memory, the Rapti River has meandered 
              over the Deokhuri Valley in unpredictable ways -- every one hundred 
              thousand years there is a cataclysmic flood that takes everything 
              with it down to India; perhaps every ten thousand years it deposits 
              an exceptionally well-ground layer of fine, plastic brown clay. 
              Every year, there comes silt and gravel. In recent years, clay is 
              found about ten feet underground in the flood plain, in a layer 
              that ranges from 1 to 3 feet deep. In the annual cycles of renewal, 
              the river regularly takes a village and its farmland, forcing the 
              people to squat in new areas, which are becoming very scarce.</p>
            
            <p>Every year, the potters must dig through the monsoon&#8217;s mud 
              and silt deposits to this layer, and carry it to their villages 
              -- a walk of 1 to 3 hours, using a pole over the shoulders with 
              two baskets hanging from the ends. The clay is soaked with water, 
              kneaded by foot, and made into a mound half as tall as a man. The 
              mound is covered with sand, which is wet down with water, and sits 
              like a large, living presence in the dark shade of the workshop. 
              It takes six days to prepare a ton of clay. This is the season of 
              Dasain or Durga Puja, which requires the biggest feast cycle of 
              the year, and the entire village, from grandparents to grandchildren, 
              is busy making pots and loading them in the communal firing house. 
              New water jars and small clay horses -- household deities -- are 
              a necessary part of the celebrations: they must be renewed each 
              year and installed ritually.</p>
            
            <p>When there are enough pots, half the village goes on the road. 
              There is limited local demand, so the potters walk long distances. 
              To walk from Deokhuri over the hills north to Dang takes two days. 
              It is where hill people come to trade, and among other purchases 
              they carry pots up the mountain. The potters could go by bus, but 
              either they do not have the necessary few rupees, or they claim 
              that breakage is high, or they simply never do things that way. 
              Instead, you can see groups of them, carrying as much as possible. 
              Men with their carrying poles, women with stacks on their heads. 
              If you calculate the costs, they do not earn their own labor. But 
              they need the small amount of cash they can earn to buy salt and 
              oil, and they come back with bags of rice. It may be that the hard 
              work and fun of going to the bazaar together is reward enough for 
              people on the edge between hard survival and simple joy. It is an 
              opportunity for the young men and women to sneak off into the forest.</p>

              are times for drinking and dancing. During the Holi festival, brown 
              skins turn day glow red and rainbow violet, as powder paint is thrown 
              at all passers by. The center of evening celebrations is a veiled, 
              silk-flashed dancer -- a female impersonator, who can dance freely 
              where the women cannot. Everybody watches, pouring beer and rakshi 
              into open mouths from wonderfully functional, phallus-spouted pots 
              -- the spouts crowned by a spiral bird's head. Later, men and women 
              do the old circle dances, after everybody is drunk enough to lose 
              their shyness.</p>
            
            <p>In February-March, all people who are able to walk a day come to 
              the festival of Shiva, held in the Lord of Deokhuri's mango grove. 
              The mood and structure are reminiscent of an American county fair, 
              with rows of bamboo booths roughly thatched with leafy branches, 
              where you can buy bangles and baubles, deep-fried sweets, tattoos, 
              rice and beans, have your fortune told, get your broken kerosene 
              lantern fixed, take your chances at ring-toss or the Wheel of Fortune. 
              The biggest attraction is a video show, which arrives hanging from 
              a procession of twenty coolies -- monitor, tape deck, speakers, 
              table, cash box, petrol and a generator that sputters its way through 
              a Hindi film. Three times. </p>
            
            <p>After that, there is a stage show, with its cloth proscenium hung 
              from the trees and a car battery-powered sound system. After several 
              false starts, five seductive singers, dressed in iridescent saris, 
              swing their hips onto the stage. Their falsetto voices give them 
              away, but their energetic rendition and pranks keep the act interesting. 
              They are female impersonators by caste, a lineage that goes back 
              more generations than they can remember. Vaudeville is alive and 
              healthy in Deokhuri. The funky band goes on until dawn, with a rapt 
              audience of about one thousand people huddled close together in 
              their shawls, on the ground. The crowd is well behaved, probably 
              because the Lord and his sons carry big sticks and manage the crowd 
              easily -- with threats alone. Drunks are carried off and stuffed 
              into empty oil drums for the night. After several days of feasting, 
              potters return to work. </p>
            
            <p><img src="images/water_jar/image018.jpg" alt="Tharu Potters&#8217; House" width="320" height="211" align="left">I 
              witnessed a major cultural transformation one year. After thousands 
              of years of round bottoms, the Tharus have started to slightly flatten 
              the base of their water pots. This occurred because cement floors 
              have become popular and you can no longer set your water jars directly 
              in a hollow in the earth. I witnessed another major change a few 
              years later, when the price of a water jar jumped from 25 to 40 
              Rupees -- 35 to 60 cents. This is a big difference to people who 
              make 70 Rupees a day. Firewood used to be collected freely by the 
              potters&#8217; wives, who go into the nearby jungle every morning 
              with hatchets balanced on their heads, and return in the afternoon 
              with huge loads of firewood in their place. This year the government 
              set up guards at all the forest entrances. Their job is to collect 
              ten rupees tax on each load of wood. The only other option is itinerant 
              labor in Rajasthan, where many of the potters already go to harvest 
              crops seasonally. The effect may well be to permanently destroy 
              a way of life. </p>
