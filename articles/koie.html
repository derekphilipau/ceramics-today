            <p><img src="images/koie/Koie-Ryoji-photo.jpg" width="76" height="86" align="left">Followers 
              of the ceramics of the Japanese artist Ryoji Koie could be excused 
              for wondering what Koie will turn his mind to next. When I first 
              met Koie in the 1970s he was making pots covered in slip and firing 
              them with wood that had been dredged from the harbor near Tokoname, 
              Koie&#8217;s home town. These pots had flashes of red and brown 
              and the sheen one associates with salt-glaze. 
            <p> <img src="images/koie/Koie_KO432.jpg" alt="Vessel by Ryoji Koie" width="278" height="314" align="left">Since 
              then Koie has been involved working in many styles. Significant 
              are his works of social commentary that refer to Hiroshima, to Nagasaki, 
              to Chernobyl. These works grace many museum collections and have 
              serious and passionate impact for those who see them and are aware 
              of their significance. Koie is also known for his work with unfired 
              clay, bringing raw earth into the gallery for a series of happenings 
              and events, radical ones of which, I have heard, caused the traditional 
              ceramic establishment to raise their eyebrows. When I visited him 
              in the 1980s at his studio in Gifu, he was cutting stone boulders 
              in half, firing one half and then realigning both sections together 
              before writing messages or signatures or dates across the cut sections. 
              But the workshop was full of pots, woodfired, oribe green glazed 
              and true fine examples of the potter&#8217;s art. And it is the 
              pots I believe to be the inspiration that has continued to fascinate 
              Koie&#8217;s followers and, possibly, the artist himself. It is 
              in the pots that Koie shows his rebellious character. While these 
              pots reflect all the pleasure and value we associate with the Japanese 
              sense of beauty, we find in them a break with tradition. With these 
              works he is placed between the pottery tradition and the contemporary 
              art of the avant-garde. The beauty is there without doubt but we 
              are also struck by the casual ease of the potter and his spirited 
              approach. </p>
            <p><img src="images/koie/Koie_KO428.jpg" alt="Vessel by Ryoji Koie" width="198" height="198" align="left">When 
              Ryoji Koie accepted my invitation to take part in ClaySculpt Gulgong 
              1995, I was not sure what to expect. Arriving early he bought several 
              items of old machinery, such as sewing machines, from the local 
              townsfolk. Koie has made a number of works using fired metal, particularly 
              for his Testament series which have appeared throughout his career. 
            </p>
            <p>A car accident limited his output during the Gulgong event to a 
              number of teabowls made with one hand &#8211; the other was broken 
              and confined in a sling. However his interaction with the other 
              invited masters as well as the participants and his knowledge of 
              woodfiring added considerably to the event, and his ebullient and 
              compassionate personality led to many stories.</p>
            <p> Born in Tokoname, a traditional ceramic town in Japan, in 1938, 
              Koie has exhibited his ceramics and contributed to workshops and 
              conferences in many countries. There are major publications and 
              catalogues devoted to his ceramics and his work has appeared in 
              books and magazines. His work was included in A Secret History of 
              Clay, From Gauguin to Gormley, shown at the Tate, Liverpool, UK, 
              and can be seen at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, and 
              the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In April 2005, his work 
              will be exhibited at Boutwell Draper Gallery, Sydney.</p>
            <p> <img src="images/koie/Koie_KO441.jpg" alt="Vessel by Ryoji Koie" width="227" height="227" align="left">Ryoji 
              Koie combines clay and glass in his figurative sculptures, creates 
              museum installations and uses metal, both found and sought, with 
              a variety of clays in other works. Known for his spontaneous response 
              to any situation, he enjoys innovation whether it be in his paintings 
              or in surface decoration on his pots. In a retrospective of his 
              work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Gifu, in 1996, works were borrowed 
              from individuals and institutions from many countries. Titled From 
              the Earth, To the Earth, works included installations and non-functional 
              pieces and mention was made of his unique tableware. These, in white 
              clay with Oribe-style green copper glaze were described as &#8220;elegant, 
              and while at first glance they seem modern and slick, they reveal 
              delicate touches of traditional craftsmanship, the intriguing innovation 
              lying precisely in the subtle interplay between the two styles.&#8221;</p>
            <p> <img src="images/koie/Koie_KR25.jpg" alt="Vessel by Ryoji Koie" width="227" height="227" align="left">Granted 
              the Oribe Award, sponsored by the Gifu Prefecture for innovative 
              activities that link industry and culture, Koie was the 1996 recipient 
              because of his contribution to the development of creativity and 
              imagination leading toward the 21st century. The catalogue published 
              to honor the artist at that time emphasized his international workshops 
              and exhibition program, focusing on the pottery he made in various 
              countries. The Australian painter Michael Johnson, writing in the 
              catalogue for the award said he felt &#8220;a sustaining joy to 
              look upon Ryoji Koie&#8217;s works of pottery. The silence of a 
              singular artist&#8217;s contribution is a worthwhile retreat... 
              Innocence at this point in time: the dream world is relevant and 
              important.&#8221; Recognizing a remarkable aura created from the 
              cultural past and contemporary world art in Koie&#8217;s work, Johnson 
              wrote: &#8220;The modest throwing of clay and glaze takes us to 
              the inside of his expression, revealed on the outside; a sense of 
              belonging. The naturalness, the energy of intuitive touch with the 
              wet earth in his hands, he excavates and reveals the inner shades 
              of meaning, fusion and flux that fires the imagination.&#8221;</p>
