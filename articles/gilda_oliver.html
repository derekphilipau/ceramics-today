                    CAN ENHANCE A MORE FREE-FLOWING creative expression of handbuilding 
                    clay. Also they can help the artist deal better with some 
                    of the problems of clay. One can save wasted hours. Using 
                    a mould can speed up the entire building process. A mould 
                    has other uses besides reproducing the same clay form over 
                    and over again. The clay heads featured in this article were 
                    hand pressed out of the same mould. When the clay heads are 
                    removed from this two piece mould they are just less than 
                    leather hard resulting in lightweight hollow forms that I 
                    can move easily. I can still change the clay in any way that 
                    I like. I can express many different versions from the same 
                    form what would seem to be impossible in one sculpture. </p>
                  <p align="left">The question of &#8216;who and what we are and 
                    what is our purpose&#8217; is a recurring theme in my work. 
                    The oversizing of the heads compared to the normal size of 
                    a human head is a technique that has been used down through 
                    the different periods of art history to convey the importance 
                    of that person or theme. In my work I have focused on human 
                    and animal heads and use live models to examine and replicate 
                    their form in a much larger size what they actually are. Using 
                    photographs of the subject is also helpful. I build, carve 
                    and model images into solid clay forms, pounding the clay 
                    with my fist. The solid clay form gives some resistance when 
                    I want to push in or dig or scrape out some areas. The moulds 
                    address the logistical requirement that clay sculpture needs 
                    to be hollow to fire properly and a mould allows you to build 
                    without internal walls. An added plus of a hollow sculpture 
                    is weight reduction. Before incorporating moulds into my building 
                    process, breakage was a serious issue, which caused countless 
                    hours of lost time.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_1_Image_0002.jpg" width="189" height="220" hspace="2"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_1_Image_0003.jpg" width="219" height="220" hspace="2"></p>
                  <p align="left"><b>STAGE 1</b> &#8211; Building the solid clay 
                    forms. The original solid sculpture can involve much clay 
                    and many hours. Build on the ground or on a durable table 
                    because of the amount of clay and the weight of the mould 
                    built around it. Recycled clay is suitable for this purpose. 
                    In the end the original can be destroyed and the clay can 
                    be reused for another sculpture. There is an important issue 
                    regarding mould-making that you must give consideration to 
                    before making your pieces, that is, dealing with the undercuts 
                    in the original sculpture. You must think of the direction 
                    that you will attempt to pull your mould off the sculpture 
                    and what could hinder the plaster mould being removed easily. 
                    A mould piece should freely detach itself so plan ahead. A 
                    Murphy&#8217;s oil soap and water mixture must be applied, 
                    to the surfaces that will be touching the next mould piece 
                    to prevent the plaster forms sticking together. I recommend 
                    that you don&#8217;t make individual mould pieces heavier 
                    than what you can handle easily.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_1_Image_0004.jpg" width="220" height="220" hspace="2"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_1_Image_0005.jpg" width="235" height="220" hspace="2"></p>
                  <p align="left"><b>STAGE 2</b> &#8211; Making the two-piece 
                    press-mould. Start by making the centre line of the solid 
                    sculpture original from the bottom of the neck area where 
                    it touches the table, up to each ear, and push the wooden 
                    or other shims down into the soft clay. Going from ear to 
                    ear by moving over the top of the head, do the same again 
                    with more shims. You have now divided the form into two sections; 
                    face front and back of head. The shims will keep the two sides 
                    of the mould separate. I also apply small pieces of grey electric 
                    tape to cover the small holes between the shims. Apply a mixture 
                    of oil soap with water to both sides of the shims and tape. 
                    Now you are ready to mix up a bucket of plaster. Half fill 
                    the bucket with water, and sift or pour in a 25-pound bag 
                    of plaster. I use an electric drill and paint mixer blade 
                    to mix the plaster. I make the two mould pieces by applying 
                    the plaster while the sculpture is standing on its neck. I 
                    wait until the plaster is as thick as whipped cream and then 
                    work quickly before it hardens too much (a second person assisting 
                    you with this part is helpful). I wipe the outside of the 
                    mould with a damp sponge so it will be smooth when it hardens.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_2_Image_0001.jpg" width="219" height="220" hspace="2"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_2_Image_0002.jpg" width="257" height="220" hspace="2"></p>
                  <p align="left"><b>STAGE 3</b> &#8211; Preparing to make the 
                    second piece of the mould once you have completed one side 
                    of the mould. Carefully remove the shims. Before you do anything 
                    else make sure to carve out at least two large indented negative 
                    space triangles on either side of the mould to make some keys. 
                    When you make the second side of the mould it will automatically 
                    fill in the negative key spaces on the first mould. The new 
                    positive key pieces which will fit in the key pieces when 
                    you reassemble the mould later. Once your plaster is mixed 
                    up and almost ready to harden, quickly make the second mould 
                    piece by applying the plaster to the other side. If you missed 
                    getting some spots to the desired 2.5 - 4 cm (1 1 1/2 in) 
                    thickness then you can mix up smaller batches of plaster to 
                    fill in and reinforce thin spots on the mould pieces. I let 
                    both pieces harden for several hours, then I turn the whole 
                    mould on to its side with someone helping me. When I can access 
                    the flat bottom of the neck of the sculpture such as this 
                    way I can scoop out all the solid clay out with a pot-tery-carving 
                    tool or my hands. The plaster press mould will last as long 
                    and strong as how well you make it (areas of the mould too 
                    thin with crumble when you press clay against them but can 
                    be reinforced with more plaster. All of my head moulds have 
                    lasted more than three years, despite numerous usages and 
                    some chipping on the edges.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_2_Image_0003.jpg" width="299" height="220"><img src="images/Gilda_Oliver/86_88_OLIVER_Gilda_Page_2_Image_0004.jpg" width="320" height="220"></p>
                  <p align="left"><b>STAGE 4</b> &#8211; Customising the raw form. 
                    I hand-press the clay into the moulds with them lying on their 
                    sides looking up at me as if they were two baby cradles. I 
                    make sure to build up the edges 5 cm (2 in) thick where the 
                    front mould piece and back will touch each other when the 
                    two sides of the mould are put together. I let the clay stiffen 
                    in the moulds overnight before I try to join the two sides 
                    together. Join the two sides of the mould together to form 
                    a complete clay head. After you have pressed the clay into 
                    the mould, it will be too soft and the clay will fall out 
                    so it is advisable to let the clay stiffen in the moulds to 
                    almost leatherhard. I want the inside parts to stiffen up 
                    but I want the places where the clay touches to stay moist. 
                    To achieve this I cover those areas with aluminum foil to 
                    keep them from becoming too dry. Make sure to remove the aluminum 
                    foil before you join the front and back pieces together. Poke 
                    holes all around the inside of the sculpture with a fork before 
                    you join the two sides together. How long you leave the clay 
                    in the mould depends on how wet or dry the plaster remains. 
                    After I make my moulds, I put them in the sun outdoors for 
                    several days or in the winter next to warm radiators. Once 
                    the form comes out of the mould the head sculpture should 
                    be about leatherhard and able to stand up on its own neck. 
                    I work freely on the leatherhard clay, making marks, adding 
                    parts, etc. If it breaks at this stage I can go back and press 
                    out another head form. The impression of the original sculpture 
                    that I laboured so hard over is still there preserved, captured 
                    into the mother mould and not lost. After the last glaze and 
                    gold firing I spend time painting on the finishing touches 
                    with oil or enamel paints. I prefer to have my pieces retain 
                    an unfinished quality to them. If you paint them with too 
                    much detail they will lose some of their visual freshness.</p>
