<IMG align=left SRC="../images/c_gills.gif" alt="C">omputer databases and processing appications lend themselves very well to the creation of programs that help to formulate glazes, which follow specific compositional rules.

<A HREF="http://www.seegreen.com/glazecalc/"><B>The Glaze Calculator</B></A> is a glaze calculation program for Windows from the UK. The site has an extensive faq sheet, news, bug reports and a BBS with questions and answers by users of the program. It is available in 16 bit and 32 bit versions for Win 3.1 and Win 95.
There are also data files of British and Japanese raw materilas available, which could be useful in the conversion of glaze recipes.
