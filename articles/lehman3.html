              <b>When Friends Turn to Pottery</b>
            <p align="center"> <img src="images/lehman/Inoue-san-TN.jpg" alt="Inoue-san" width="198" height="317"><br>
              Dedicated to Inoue-san
            <p><br>
              As I boarded the shinkansen (bullet train) in Mishima -- to travel 
              to Nagoya to meet Mr. Inoue, my 87-year-old friend of 10 years -- 
              I had an annoying lump in my stomach. It wasn't any nervousness 
              about negotiating the shinkansen (it was a straight shot to Nagoya). 
              Nor was it gastronomic in nature, for last night's sushi feast and 
              microbrew adventure (see story #2) was still making my mouth water 
              with delight.</p>
            <p><img src="images/lehman/nagoya.gif" alt="Map of Japan" width="149" height="159" align="right">No, 
              this anxious feeling from deep inside me was more self-oriented, 
              self-incriminating almost. &quot;Why?&quot; I heard myself asking, 
              &quot;why did I invite myself to visit Mr. Inoue for an overnight. 
              After all, he is 87. How inconsiderate of me. I should have arranged 
              for my own accommodation and just visited for a few hours, so as 
              not to inconvenience Mr. and Mrs. Inoue.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;And my own Japanese language skills are certainly no better 
              now -- perhaps worse -- than they were the last time I visited here 
              in 1999. How self-centered of me to assume that, in their mid-eighties, 
              they are still willing to struggle through the difficulties of &quot;Japanese-English-Dictionary-conversations!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What was I thinking when I obligated them to a day and a 
              half of hosting me? What an imposition.&quot; I sensed a recognizable 
              dread within myself -- that peculiar kind of dread (perhaps you 
              know the taste of it) which accompanies the sudden and awful realization 
              that &quot;the plan&quot; (that had naively seemed a sound and sensible 
              idea until this very moment) has just ambushed you with its obvious 
              foibles! I was very suddenly full of self-doubt.</p>
            <p>But it was too late to change course. Mr. Inoue had probably already 
              purchased a ticket just so he could be up on the platform to meet 
              me as I descend from car #6. And sure enough, there he was. &quot;Follow 
              me,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>My misgivings were not at all allayed as I followed him, wordless, 
              through the Nagoya Station, and out onto the street. &quot;Eating&quot;, 
              he motioned with his hand to his mouth, and set out at a pace far 
              too nimble for his 87 years, with me struggling to keep up, carrying 
              all the luggage that was to accompany me through two weeks of travel. 
              Still no talking.</p>
            <p>At the table in the restaurant, while we silently waited for our 
              food, I pulled out my photo album, sure that this would break the 
              ice, and allowing me to practice my well-rehearsed and memorized 
              &quot;captions.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Let's see. These are our sons, Scott and Brent, in the marching 
              band, and here is the elementary school where my wife Jolene teaches, 
              here's the water garden at our home, that's the church we attend, 
              and here, these are works from my most recent 8-day wood firing.&quot; 
              Yet at this, the tension seemed to grow even thicker -- or was it 
              my thick tongue and my poor Japanese pronunciation? The food arrived. 
              We ate in silence. &quot;What have I done? What have I set myself 
              up for?&quot; I wondered. &quot;Is Inoue-san feeling some of the 
              same misgivings as well?&quot;</p>
            <p>As we left the restaurant, Inoue-san indicated that we would be 
              visiting a nearby exhibition. He explained that he did not know 
              the potter, but that we would go to the exhibition anyway. We walked 
              to the gallery where Ishida Tosyun was having her exhibition of 
              wood-fired works. With the pots around and between us, suddenly 
              we both began to relax. Our shared &quot;ceramic&quot; vocabulary 
              (in both Japanese and English) began to fill the gaps that our shared 
              &quot;social&quot; vocabulary had not been able to. Mr. Inoue's 
              shoulders started to relax, and the knot in my stomach eased. We 
              smiled and laughed, touched pots and understood what each other 
              was thinking. We had tea and sweets. &quot;Do you want to ask her 
              anything?&quot; asked Inoue-san. And for 20 minutes we had an engaging 
              (albeit dictionary-aided) conversation about pottery-making methods, 
              clay bodies, kiln designs, and firing approaches.</p>
            <p>After we left the exhibition and while walking in downtown Nagoya, 
              almost as an afterthought, Inoue-san pointed to a major department 
              store and inquired &quot;Shall we see the china department?&quot; 
              (Ah, the ceramics in a department store gallery, I thought.)</p>
            <p>Inside, on the sixth floor, there at first seemed to be no gallery 
              at all. But after a bit of walking we came to a small alcove where 
              some fine pots came into view: immediately we both recognized Isezaki 
              Jun's work, and pieces by Kato Shigetaka and Kato Shuunto (Mr. Inoue, 
              in fact, had introduced me to the latter two potters when I last 
              visited in 1999). Some fine old &quot;horse-eye&quot; plates came 
              into view. &quot;Oh, look at this,&quot; said Mr. Inoue, as he pointed 
              to a remarkable yellow Seto bowl made by Kato Tokuro (1898 - 1985). 
            </p>
            <p align="center"><br>

              First published in Chunichi Shinbun-sha, 1997 </p>
            <p>A young salesman came to greet us. I ventured a question about 
              being able to see the foot of the horse-eye plate. He happily obliged. 
              Then I asked about seeing the foot of the Kato Tokuro chawan (which 
              was behind glass). After a little hesitation, we were shown the 
              beautifully trimmed foot. </p>
            <p>At that moment, the manager of the department came into view and 
              we introduced ourselves. He seemed quite a bit curious at this American's 
              interest in the foot of a teabowl. &quot;Would you like to see more 
              of Kato's works?&quot; he asked. &quot;Here, come with me, let me 
              show you.&quot;</p>
            <p>As we were led to yet another more-secluded room, I caught Mr. 
              Inoue's eye. It was sparkling! And the corners of his mouth could 
              not control the smile that was breaking out. I suspected that we 
              were both remembering the magic that had happened to us in 1999 
              -- the visits to Kato Shigetaka, Kato Shuunto, and Kato Takuo (recognized 
              as a Ningen Kokuho, or Living National Treasure). It seemed that 
              when we sought to surround ourselves with pottery, some &quot;ceramic 
              magic&quot; began to happen.</p>
            <p>After we were seated, cupboards were opened, and the dark age-stained 
              palomia boxes began to be unpacked. We were treated to four chawan 
              by Kato Tokuro (one example each of Shino, Gray Shino, Black Seto, 
              and Karatsu). A one-person show for the two of us! The conversation 
              became even more relaxed surrounding these exuberant and extraordinary 
              pots. The gray Shino piece had the most remarkable foot! The viewing 
              and handling flowed into &quot;maatcha&quot; and sweets and barley 
              tea, then more pots, images of the American's pots for the manager, 
              more conversation, more magic. </p>
            <p>This, I thought to myself, is why I dared to suggest to Inoue-san 
              that we spend some time together, and this is why, I continued musing 
              -- despite the gulf in language, age and culture - this is why Inoue-san 
              had said yes. Perhaps we had both been remembering the captivating 
              moments of 1999 and had intuitively known that if we surrounded 
              ourselves with pottery, that it might happen again.</p>
            <p>That evening in Inoue-san's home, we shared &quot;maatcha&quot; 
              from a chawan made by Hineno Sakuzo -- the teabowl had been a favorite 
              of Mr. Inoue's father. We also drank from a 100-year-old Raku chawan.</p>
            <p>And the next day we visited Tsukamoto Mitsuru, who works in exquisite 
              celadon-glazed porcelains. Mitsuru-san is the son of Tsukamoto Kaiji, 
              who in 1983 became a Ningen Kokuho, and for whom Mr. Inoue's father, 
              Setsuzo-san, worked as designer and mold-maker for decades. We had 
              the opportunity to see some of Tsukamoto Kaiji's original designs 
              (deep-blue celadons that were remarkably intense!), and some of 
              Tsukamoto Mitsuru's softer, more-subdued celadon works. </p>

            <p>And as good luck would have it, some of the designs of Mr. Inoue's 
              father were still being produced. It seemed only right that in this 
              spellbinding moment I should purchase one of these small pieces, 
              tying together symbolically the life work of Inoue-san's father, 
              my friendship with Mr. Inoue, and the father-son team of Ningen 
              Kokuho fame. As I attempted to purchase the piece I heard these 
              words from Tsukamoto Mitsuru: &quot;Oh, please, take this as a gift 
              -- this will be important to you.&quot; He knew.</p>
            <p>The yakishime guinomi that I left with Tsukamoto-san will not likely 
              mean as much to him as his piece will mean to me. But I am so grateful 
              for the wonderful exchange.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Inoue was not finished. The afternoon included a visit 
              to Suzuki Osamu, current Ningen Kokuho in the Shino tradition. Mr. 
              Inoue's father, and Suzuki's father, it turned out, had been close 
              friends. The remarkable kindness of both Mr. Inoue and Mr. Suzuki 
              capped another unforgettable visit to Nagoya.</p>

            <p>As I boarded the train at the station later that afternoon -- now 
              heading for Okayama -- the nervous stomach lump was long-gone. And 
              I marveled at the remarkable friendship, the wonderfully improbable 
              happenings and the sheer magic that can occur when two people of 
              different generations, cultures, and languages share a mutual love 
              of fine pottery.<br>
