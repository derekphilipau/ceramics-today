              <li> Here is a big jar at the entrance of the Path, it was made 
                for pharmaceutical products in the 1940s. The big bowls along 
                the Path are called &quot;Suiren-bachi&quot;, &quot;bowls for 
                water lilies&quot; which are filled with water and placed in the 
                corner of a yard. People enjoy seeing water lilies, water grasses, 
                goldfish and things like that in them. <a href="images/tokoname/bigjar.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. 
                <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Kilns at that time needed to be built on inclines, so it was 
                advantageous to build them on the hillsides. The Path is therefore 
                hilly. This ceramic mural is made by elementary students. <a href="images/tokoname/mural.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. 
                <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Ceramic pipes are used to support the banks. This style is seen 
                in many places in Tokoname. This is recycling of inferior pipes. 
                Ceramic pipes are made for water service and sewerage. They are 
                resistant to the sudden changes of temperatures and heat and very 
                durable as well. <br>
                <br>
                There are many kinds of ceramic pipes such as round, square, and 
                with branches or sockets. Pipes with four, six, or nine holes 
                are used for electric cables. Once a traffic accident occurred 
                in a tunnel on the Tomei expressway and caused a big fire in it. 
                But the electric cables covered with ceramic pipes remained unburnt 
                and safe. This is a good example to show their resistance to heat. 
                <a href="images/tokoname/cer-duct.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.
                <br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>One of the famous views in Tokoname is the brick chimneys. The 
                tallest one is 25 meters and the shortest is about 13 meters. 
                This chimney was shortened to prevent collapse from earthquakes 
                and typhoons. Chimney size is related to kiln size. Burning efficiency 
                was taken into account when they were built.<br>
                <br>
                Symbolic to the scenery of Tokoname, over 300 to 400 brick chimneys 
                existed in the 1950s which was then at the peak industrial period. 
                During that time clouds of pure black smoke belched from the many 
                chimneys every day. The sun light was greatly reduced.<br>
                <br>
                This type of chimney scenery is associated with the production 
                of pottery in Tokoname. The city produced relatively large ceramics 
                like pipes, jars and bowls. They needed big kilns and this gave 
                rise to these kinds of chimneys. This scenery is reminiscent of 
                that of <a href="staffordshire.html"><b>Staffordshire</b></a> (Ed.
                note).<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Fuels have been changed from coal to heavy oil and finally to 
                gas. Once kilns had been converted to gas, chimneys lost their 
                important roles and became useless. Old chimneys that are in danger 
                of collapse have been demolished one after another. Today 90 still 
                exist but only 50 to 60 of them remain in perfect condition. <a href="images/tokoname/kemuri.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.

                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Large water jars, frog-shaped big jars and pots are displayed 
                here. They are made by a method called &quot;Himozukuri&quot; 
                or coil-building. Thick clay coils are formed first, then the 
                coils are gradually piled up one by one. A potter begins by placing 
                one coil on another and waits until they get dry, and he repeats 
                this process many times. Making a big jar by this method requires 
                about one week. <a href="images/tokoname/frogjar.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. 
                <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li> You see big jars on both sides, which are for making pickles. 
                <a href="images/tokoname/jarpickl.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.
                <br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>There is a big old building on your right side below. It was 
                built around the 1850s and used for a shipping agency. No one 
                has lived in it for about 30 years, Tokoname City is planning 
                to make good use of this house as a gathering place for people.<br>
                <br>
                There is close relation between shipping and ceramics. Ceramics 
                had been carried by ship to all over Japan since the old days. 
                In the 12th century, many shipping routes were developed. Nowadays 
                most ceramics are transported overland.<br>
                <br>
                On that narrow slope, clay rings once used for firing ceramic 
                pipes are buried to prevent slipping. <a href="images/tokoname/dokanwa.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. 
                <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Here is a&quot;Dokanzaka&quot;, and one of the highlights of 
                the Pottery Path. It has been selected as one of &quot;the 30 
                famous Japanese hills&quot;. Please enjoy the beautiful ceramic 
                pipes and humorous looks of the sake bottles. Clay rings are also 
                buried here.<br>
                <br>
                The ceramic information board explains the various stages in the 
                production of Tokoname-ware. <a href="images/tokoname/dokanzaka.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.

                <br>
              </li>
              <li>This is &quot;Noborigama Hiroba&quot;, Climbing Kiln Square, 
                which was opened in 1995. There were a lot of pottery factories 
                one time before in this area especially centering on the hilly 
                sides. In that exhibition pavilion, a square down-draft kiln with 
                two fire mouths built in 1910s is well preserved. A pottery class 
                providing pot making experience for you is held on the second 
                floor. Reservation is necessary for that.<br>
                <br>
                The monument placed in the center of the square is about six meters 
                high and titled &quot;Jikuu&quot; which means passing over time. 
                It expresses &quot;Present&quot;, &quot;Past&quot;, &quot;Future&quot;. 
                It's made by a potter named Masaaki Shibata.<br>
                <br>
                A bow-shaped large mural is named &quot;Glitter&quot;. 25,000 
                pieces of a pyramid-formed blocks five centimeters square are 
                used in it. Their colors change as you walk along the mural. Junpei 
                Sugie built this, who is a potter as well as a professor at a 
                college of art.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a &quot;<b><a href="images/tokoname/waterhap.gif">Suikinkutsu</a></b>&quot;, 
                an echo chamber, near the bower. &quot;Suikinkutsu&quot; was invented 
                as a technology of Japanese gardening in the period from the 1810s 
                to the 1830s. It was usually built close to a room for a tea ceremony. 
                People enjoyed the beautiful and clear trickling sounds of the 
                water that echo in the pot. It is a pot with a hole at the bottom 
                buried upside down in the ground. Some water is stored at the 
                lower part of the pot. Water drops come from above through the 
                hole to the surface of the stored water. You can hear the music 
                of the echoes as water falls into the pot. <a href="images/tokoname/kilnsqu2.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>. 
                <a href="tokoname5.html"><b>Map</b></a>.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li> This Climbing Kiln is designated as an important cultural asset 
                of the nation. It was built in about 1887 and operated till about 
                1973. It is the largest in Japan. Coal and wood were used to fire 
                it. The firing took eight days and nights. Products made here 
                were mostly flower pots, teapots, charcoal braziers, vases and 
                sake wares.<br>
                <br>
                Climbing kilns are not used today except by a few potters. This 
                kind of kiln used wood and coal for fuel. They were structurally 
                inefficient, in addition to causing air pollution. It was heavy 
                labor to fire them. Nowadays gas, electricity and kerosene are 
                major fuels. Why some potters are particularly interested in climbing 
                kilns is that they enjoy the varying textures and colors that 
                this kind of kiln produces. Many pottery lovers are fond of the 
                unexpected finishes produced by a climbing kiln.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                There are ten chimneys behind the kiln, feel free to take a look 
                around the kiln. There are still potters living on the Sanpomichi 
                that remember firing this kiln. <a href="images/tokoname/climbkln.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.

                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Here is a foot bridge crossing two factories above the Path, 
                which was used to increase the efficiency of the factories. Removal 
                and demolition of past bridges make this one quite rare.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>The wall on the left side has been repaired recently. Old ceramic 
                pipes were thoughtfully buried in the wall so as to suit the landscape 
                of the Pottery Path. This kind of consideration maintains the 
                landscape of the Pottery Path. <a href="images/tokoname/pavement.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.

                <br>
              </li>
              <li>This is the studio of a craftsman who still uses a traditional 
                technique. He makes large works with the technique of coiling 
                building. We may find him working, if our timing is right.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>This is a bridge called &quot;Ichikibashi&quot;. There were 
                more chimneys and factories operating in this area thirty years 
                ago. Factories which opted for modern producing systems and mass 
                production have moved to the suburbs. As you understand after 
                walking the area, the roads for cars are limited and also very 
                narrow. Some factories are stopping production because of the 
                difficulties to find the successors. The scenery will gradually 
                change. But we'd like to carefully maintain this exclusive scenery 
                of Tokoname. <a href="images/tokoname/ichikibr.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.

              <li>Here we are back at the starting point, Ceramic Hall. Thank 
                you for being with us. If you are in town, the Pottery Path also 
                has a B course. Institutions such as The Ceramic Art Institute, 
                The Ceramic History Museum, INAX Tile Museum and The Kiln Museum 
                Gallery are found there. If you have time, please visit them, 
                too. Moreover, there are pottery galleries and a wholesale pottery 
                market in Tokoname. You can enjoy shopping for Tokoname-ware there 
                as well. <a href="images/tokoname/ceramichall.jpg"><b>Image</b></a>.
