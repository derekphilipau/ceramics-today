        is one of those cultural items, which has a strong connection to ceramics 
        - thanks to the teapot and the teabowl. It is a very pervasive drink, 
        not only in Eastern societies, but also in the West. The same thing can 
        be said of tea utensils, such as the teapot, which is also a collectors 
        item in both the East and the West -- one need think only of the coveted 
        <a href="http://www.theteahouse.com/yixing.html"><b>Yixing Teapot</b></a>.
      <p>Teapots have a rich <a href="http://www.teapots.net/"><b>history</b></a> 
        and are thought to have originated at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty 
        (1368-1644) in China. Today we are more familiar with the <a href="http://www.easterntea.com/teaceremony.html"><b>Japanese
        Tea Ceremony</b></a>, but there is also a <a href="http://www.easterntea.com/ceremony/chineseceremony.html"><b>Chinese
        Tea Ceremony</b></a> and even a <a href="http://www.teaconcepts.com/dRussianTea.asp"><b>Russian</b></a> 
        one. In Japan, the Arita Teapot is well known, but in China and also the 
        west, we are more familiar with <a href="http://www.easterntea.com/galleries/yigal1.html"><b>Yixing
        Teapots</b></a>, although of course there are many more styles, such as 
        the lessor known TeoChew Teapot. If you are thinking of becoming a collector 
        of teapots, it is important to know <a href="http://www.easterntea.com/research/teapots.html"><b>how
        to choose and appreciate</b></a> them. 
      <p>The west now also has a tradition of <a href="http://www.ferringallery.com/gallery/contemp_teapots_artists/"><b>contemporary 
        teapots</b></a>. A good example of a well known English teapot maker is 
        <a href="050300a.html"><b>Josiah Wedgwood</b></a>. Modern artists have
        been fascinated by this cultural object, as can be seen in Leslie Ferrins 
        new book <a href="http://www.ferringallery.com/tptransformed.html"><i><b>Teapots 
        Transformed: Exploration of an Object</b></i></a>, which traces the transformation 
        of the contemporary American teapot from its functional, traditional origins 
        in the early 1960&#146;s to its present status as a sculptural object. 
        Garth Clark's publication <a href="102797.html"><i><b>The Eccentric Teapot,
        Four Hundred Years of Innovation</b></i></a>, takes a look at the more 
        gregarious manifestations of that humble but universal domestic appliance, 
        the teapot. Far from the simpler examples, as may be found in your average 
        Chinese restaurant (ever seen one with the lid attached with fishing line?), 
        this survey of teapots of the past four centuries covers everything from 
        Yixing pots to the Japanese Book of Tea, the Boston Tea Party to the famous 
        &quot;Suprematist Teapot&quot; by Kasemir Malevich. 
      <p>Of course, as <a href="http://www.ferringallery.com/gallery/studiopotters/index.html"><b>studio
        potters</b></a> or hobbyists, we are also makers of teapots. Being such 
        a widespread cultural item, there are many<a href="053199.html"><b> hints</b></a>
        on how to improve your teapot making techniques. The humble teapot has 
        also made its way into computer design, with various people generating 
        <a href="http://portalmarket.com/teagallery.html"><b>3D models</b></a>.
