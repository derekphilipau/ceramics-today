              Bruegel and his Rheinisch Stoneware 
            <p align="left">The Flemish painter <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/B/bruegel.html"><b>Pieter 
              Bruegel the Elder</b></a>, also nicknamed 'Peasant Bruegel' lived 
              from 1525-1569. He was influenced by Hieronymous Bosch, while he 
              himself strongly influenced later Flemish painting. The topics of 
              his paintings were the countryside and the peasants that lived there 
              (although he himself was far from being a peasant).</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/breugel.jpg" alt="Peasant Dance" width="400" height="300"></p>
            <p align="left">His work '<b><a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/B/bruegel/dance.jpg.html" target="_blank">Peasant 
              Dance</a></b>', painted 1568, shows a group of peasants dancing 
              to music in front of what might be the local tavern. The atmosphere 
              is lively and a few drinks have probably already been downed - there 
              is kissing going on and a heated discussion is happening at the 
              table. The woman on the right has a money pouch and a key - she 
              has some position of relative importance, perhaps a tavern or some 
              other shop owner. The times seem happy and carefree, but war is 
              not far away, and defense may be needed at any time, as evidenced 
              by the short sword at the dancing man's side.</p>
            <p align="left"> Interestingly for the potter, Bruegel's painting 
              also depicts a number of Rheinisch stoneware pots. The name <a href="http://www.jefpat.org/diagnostic/Historic_Ceramic_Web_Page/Historic%20Ware%20Descriptions/Rhenish.HTM"><b>Rheinisch 
              Stoneware</b></a> (sometimes labeled 'Rhenish') stems from the river 
              Rhine (in German, 'Rhein'), along which it was predominantly made 
              during Bruegel's lifetime in the 16th C.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/breugel_jug2.jpg" alt="Bruegel jug" width="154" height="200" hspace="4"><img src="images/breugel_jug.jpg" alt="Bruegel jug" width="141" height="200" hspace="4"></p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/krug.jpg" alt="16th C salt-glazed jug" width="69" height="100" align="left">Above 
              we see two examples of Rheinisch stoneware, a four handled and a 
              single handled jug, extracted from Bruegel's painting. What can 
              we deduce from this? First of all we can say that Rheinisch stoneware 
              was made for the peasantry, and not the gentry of 16th C society. 
              These were mugs and jugs made for everyday use and probably saw 
              a lot of it, as is implied by the broken handle visible below the 
              dancing woman on the right. Note the interesting blow-out firing 
              fault visible on the single handled jug on the right, probably caused 
              by a stone embedded in the rough clay. Note also the finger or thumb 
              marks along the base of the pots, crudely making the 'frilled' foot 
              rim typical of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. These 
              vessels were not made with aesthetics in mind, but purely for functional 
              purposes, without much time wasted on appearances. Rheinisch stoneware 
              was salt-glazed ware, which 16th C Germany became particularly well 
              known for. This was rough, tough stoneware, made for everyday domestic 
              use - fermenting, drinking, storage etc., in contrast to the more 
              decorative works of German faience. In color these salt-glazed stonewares 
              ranged from gray to white and brown, depending on the iron content. 
              Salt-glaze was particularly suited to functional ware, being even 
              impervious to acids. Thus Rheinisch salt-glaze wares also found 
              much use with apothecaries. Its main centers of manufacture were 
              Cologne (K&ouml;ln), Frechen, H&ouml;hr-Grenzhausen, Siegburg and 
              Raeren (further to the south).</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/map.gif" alt="Map of central Europe" width="400" height="400"></p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/bartmannskrug.jpg" alt="Bartmannskrug" width="163" height="241" align="left">A 
              famous example of Rheinisch saltglaze is the 'Bartmannskrug', literally 
              the 'Bearded Man Jug', a round-bellied jug with a bearded face on 
              it's neck. In England, they were called 'Greybeards' or '<b><a href="http://www1.bellarmine.edu/strobert/jugs/index.asp">Bellarmines</a></b>', 
              which stems from the name of then hated Cardinal Bellarmino. Sprigged 
              relief decoration is typical of Rheinisch stoneware, especially 
              from the Renaissance and later periods.</p>
            <p align="left">Stoneware developed in Germany independently of Eastern 
              influences around 800 AD. Salt-glaze emerged as a popular technique 
              around the 16th C. Clays were mined with various methods. Around 
              Siegburg, clay could be found close to the surface and only shallow 
              digging was necessary, but at Raeren in the Westerwald, deep shafts 
              were dug to reach the clay. Similar to ageing processes in the East, 
              the clay was left exposed to the elements for a season or so, to 
              improve plasticity. Later, sand would be added as a form of grog, 
              to add 'tooth' and reduce shrinkage.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/medieval_potter.jpg" alt="Medieval Female Potter" width="188" height="268" align="left">But 
              it was not only clay that needed to be located close to the workshops, 
              but also wood for firing. This was found in abundance in the Westerwald 
              (the Western Wood), where beech was cut for that purpose. The wood 
              had to be dried for up to six months before it could be used as 
              fuel. When salt-glazing became common in the 16th C, large quantities 
              of salt were also required. Being a well frequented trade route, 
              the river Rhine was able to facilitate this. Thus we find the main 
              salt-glaze centers in medieval Germany are located along or near 
              river ports to which northern sea-salt would be delivered.</p>
            <p align="left">Interestingly, as can be seen from the mid <a href="http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards23.html"><b>15th
              C Hof&auml;mterspiel</b></a> tarot card above, strutted kick-wheels 
              were in use at the time. The woman potter is using a piece of bone 
              to incise a pattern on the pot she is throwing.</p>
            <p align="left">Bruegel's painting 'Peasant Dance' shows that Rheinisch 
              saltglazed wares were widespread and not only popular in Germany 
              but also in neighboring countries. In fact, Rheinisch stoneware 
              was exported to England and as far as <a href="http://www.mcc.gouv.qc.ca/region/03/tresors/page104a.html" target="_blank"><b>Quebec,
              Canada</b></a>.</p>
