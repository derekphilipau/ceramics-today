              the many types of clay, porcelain is the finest -- and the most 
              difficult to 'throw' (form on a potters wheel). Porcelain, an 'artificial' 
              clay, is certainly no matrial for the beginning potter, who would 
              be much better off starting with a more robust clay like stoneware 
              or earthenware. </p>
            <P> But there are a few points that can be taken into consideration 
              when throwing porcelain. Porcelain is fairly 'short', i.e. it does 
              not have much plasticity. As it does not have much plastic strength, 
              it also tends to 'flop' easily, especially when too much water has 
              been used, or it is 'overworked'. So it is a good idea to use as 
              little water as possible when throwing porcelain. 
            <P> <b>Tip 1:</b> 
            <ul>
              Don't throw porcelain with water; use a porcelain slurry, which 
              will give the necessary lubrication with less water content. 
            </ul>
            <P> If a piece, let's say a bowl form, is overworkrd, it will tend 
              to flop, i.e. it's walls will collapse. Once this has happened, 
              one might as well start afresh. However cutting the clay off the 
              wheelhead and rekneading it will not always suffice. To regenerate 
              the clay, kneading, letting it rest overnight and then rekneading 
              again is usually a good way to go. 
            <P> <b>Tip 2:</b> 
            <ul>
              If a piece looks like it might be getting a bit 'floppy', try working 
              it lightly with a gas burner, an electric paint stripper or even 
              a hairdryer set to 'hot'. This will dry out the clay enough to give 
              it another go. Of course the wheel should be turning while you do 
              this, to ensure an even distribution of the heat. 
            </ul>
            <P> Generally it will be easier to throw thick-walled pieces than 
              thin-walled ones, but with practice wall thicknesses of about that 
              of a one cent coin or even thinner are possible. This will also 
              depend on the scale of a work -- the larger the piece, the thicker 
              the walls will have to be (to support the weight above). 
            <P> <b>Tip 3:</b> 
            <ul>
              Thin walls are not only achieved by throwing, but even more so by 
              turning (cutting off further layers of 'leatherhard' clay with special 
              'turning' tools). 
            </ul>
            <P> Another common problem with throwing porcelain is cracking, which 
              can occur during the drying process, or during firing. 
            <P> <b>Tip 4:</b> 
            <ul>
              Never let throwing water accumulate in the base of your vessel. 
              Cut a piece of sponge and tie it to the end of a chop stick or something 
              similar. Use this tool to remove any excess throwing water or slurry 
              from the base of your pots. 
            </ul>
            <P> Cracking is usually caused by uneven compression of the clay (I 
              will not delve into the issue of drying here). Some clays such as 
              raku or coarse earthenwares can be relatively forgiving in this 
              respect, but not porcelain. Uneven compression can result from water 
              accumulating in the base (see Tip 4). More often than not, it is 
              a problem with compressing the clay during centering. 
            <P> <b>Tip 5:</b> 
            <ul>
              Center your porcelain on the wheelhead; cut off with a cutting wire; 
              turn around (bash it back onto the wheel upside down) and recenter. 
              This method of centering will ensure that your clay is as compressed 
              on the bottom as it is on the top. 
            </ul>
            <P> Another problem may happen after throwing the best piece, but 
              then it collapses as you are trying to get it off the wheel. That 
              can be pretty frustrating after putting so much effort into getting 
              it so perfect! 
            <P> <b>Tip 6:</b> 
            <ul>
              To ensure your work doesn't collapse when removing it from the wheel, 
              dry it out a bit (evenly and carefully!) with a small burner attached 
              to a portable gas bottle. In fact, with a bit of practice, you can 
              do this to such a fine degree, that you can turn the work immediately 
              on the spot, without first removing it from the wheel. 
            </ul>
            <P> While these hints are not comprehensive, I hope that they will 
              help one or the other person with their porcelain throwing technique. 
              However theory alone will never be enough -- in this case the old 
              adage "practice makes perfect" certainly does apply! 
            <P> Happy throwing!
