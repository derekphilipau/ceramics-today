            <p> I was talking shop at an art fair once with a potter from across 
              the state. I admired his sparse but realistic drawing style on his 
              large platters. I learned he was more of a producer than I was, 
              using twice as much clay as I did in a month. We got to talking 
              about galleries, and I mentioned one that had been doing well for 
              me. I didn&#8217;t think much about it until the next time I stopped in 
              the gallery, and saw a large display of that potter&#8217;s wares. I realized 
              then I&#8217;d aided a competitor... I felt like that potter had taken 
              advantage of my friendliness to my detriment. I started to feel 
              like my sales weren&#8217;t as good there as they used to be, although 
              in retrospect it could have just been my imagination. Competition 
              is constantly with us. It is with us as we begin learning pottery. 
              If we learn to center quicker than the others, we&#8217;ve got an edge. 
              If our sculptures meet the approval of our teacher more than the 
              other students, we get the better grade, or better recommendation 
              for graduate school. Yet in that same environment, cooperation is 
              also a vital strategy for success. If I have a problem, I&#8217;ll mention 
              it to anyone who can help me, and in return if someone approaches 
              me with a problem I know something about, I&#8217;ll be happy to share 
              what I know. We are both better off than if we struggled on our 
              own. 
            <p>If ceramics were a simple undertaking, cooperation would not be 
              so necessary. But the field of ceramics is complex enough that no 
              one is expert in all areas of competence, such as clay composition, 
              forming processes, glazes (in all their temperature ranges and atmospheres), 
              and firing processes. 
            <p>The spirit of cooperation has long been reflected in Ceramics Monthly 
              Magazine, where potters sharing ideas and processes have shaped 
              their counterparts around the world. In addition the Internet has 
              become integral to fostering this cooperative relationship, as questions 
              on very specific problems can be addressed to persons most experienced 
              in that area. Some people (including myself) have chosen to create 
              helpful web pages in their areas of expertise For specific questions 
              and answers the Clayart listserv (which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/clayart"><b>http://www.egroups.com/list/clayart</b></a>) 
              and the newsgroup <b>rec.crafts.pottery</b> are probably the most 
              widely accessed in this regard, as well as the <a href="http://ceramics.about.com/mpboards.html"><b>forum
              at Ceramics Today</b></a>. 
            <p>One reason that this cooperative system works is that a potter 
              in Australia does not feel in competition with one in Ohio, and 
              thus will share secrets freely. However the Web is becoming more 
              prevalent as a marketplace, and competition again becomes a factor, 
              as the various pottery web sites vie for the same pool of shoppers. 
              Both competition and cooperation are vital to our survival. While 
              I favor the cooperative approach, I know that there are valid boundaries 
              to set as to how far one should cooperate. If I work for years to 
              develop a wonderful glaze, it is a sane decision to keep the recipe 
              to myself, if it is what makes my current work special. But my formerly 
              wonderful glazes, now history, may be just what someone else can 
              do wonders with. Also competition fosters an improved product, as 
              we try to equal others accomplishments, or are knocked out of our 
              complacency. 
            <p>I would rather think our real competition lies with the mass manufacturers, 
              that we are all compatriots promoting human made craft over machined 
              indifference. This is certainly the case where corporations have 
              mimicked hand made style, clearly competing in our arena. And it 
              lies in all our interests to promote the use of handcrafted articles, 
              and to cooperate so that we can produce the best possible of these 
              things of clay.
