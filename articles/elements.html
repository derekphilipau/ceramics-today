              a show of 6 Indian and 12 international ceramic artists in Delhi.<br>
              </b> 
            <p align="left"> <b>A booming Indian market</b>
            <p align="left"> A ceramic exhibition that brings together 6 Indian 
              and 12 international ceramic artists could either pick up the thread 
              while severing the continuity or speak about crossing over of cultural 
              trends in the idiom of ceramic making in a world that has come to 
              recognize it as an art form. Forget the debate about craft/art but 
              the fact that Marcio Mattos of England sold out and a number of 
              international potters sold well on Indian terra firma aptly proved 
              that India is a market to look out for in terms of ceramics. Delhi 
              Blue Pottery has in the past brought together a number of exhibitions 
              in the ceramic frontier but in a way this show could speak about 
              the technicalities of choice, the parameters of bias and the refreshing 
              angles of international trends proving that India has found its 
              own niche in the language of ceramics.
            <p align="left"> A ceramic work can either have the authoritative 
              power and hypnotic grace of the surface of the sea, or it can come 
              down to mundane mediocrity, In the hands of a ceramic artist who 
              can understand and weave nature&#8217;s prowess into clay it can 
              reflect the sheer face of a mountain cliff or the sweep of a plain 
              of grass &#8212; yet without any recourse to illusion, metaphor 
              or representation, be a work that truly invites a heartfelt response. 
              Think of ceramic works as cultural equivalents rather than natural 
              embodiments, think of them as reflective absorptions rather than 
              pedestrian churnings that have come off the wheel and Elements in 
              the capital city of India came through as a mixed bag, a cocktail 
              of concoctions that held sublime bliss and also brought indifferent 
              reponses to a grand expectation.
            <p align="left"> <b>India&#8217;s Hamada</b>
            <p align="left"> 'The art of ceramics is one that brings signs of 
              pleasure in a variety of guises', said potter and teacher Kristine 
              Michael to me 15 years ago during a solo showing. In a quixotic 
              way Kristine is not part of this show, neither are some of the best 
              names in the Indian circuit but in terms of what the Indian 6 have 
              to offer the only works that came upto facing a definitive critical 
              appreciation were the works of mendicant Vineet Kacker.The symbol 
              of a sacred script, the lingua franca of vintage simplicity. the 
              lucid languor of a dulcet toned glaze that presents cultural connections. 
              Vineet&#8217;s works were a set of three creations in a meditative 
              mould. Earth Mandala, Bodhisattva and Sidham-Platter Karma.The Earth 
              Mandala platters looked more like stone reliefs that whispered the 
              tenets of erosional counterpoints. All three Earth Mandalas somehow 
              miraculously evoked the conjunction of land, winds, sky and sea. 
              It is almost as if within this singular construct Vineet gave us 
              the space of a primordial shoreline where timeless stability and 
              constant vacillation continuously trade places.
            <p align="left">Vineet Kacker:
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vineet_kacker2.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vineet_kacker2.JPG" alt="Vineet Kacker" width="200" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vineet_kacker5.jpg"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vineet_kacker5.jpg" alt="Vineet Kacker" width="143" height="150" hspace="2" border="0"></a><br>
              <a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vineet_kacker4.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vineet_kacker4.JPG" alt="Vineet Kacker" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a> 
              <a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vineet_kacker.jpg"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vineet_kacker.jpg" alt="Vineet Kacker" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a>
            <p>Vineet&#8217;s Siddhi-Platter Karma in stoneware spoke in the vein 
              of a flashback to the aura of antiquity. Against a tenured glaze 
              that spoke of rough-hewn porocity, with the symbol just making a 
              significant yet autocratic signature this work is more like a scripted 
              tenet that travels through time. His series Bodhisattva platters 
              had about them the deeply felt resonance of a ruminative distinction, 
              a warming softness of intent that spoke in softened hues about the 
              Buddhist leanings that venerate the chant but distill it in its 
              cadences of inner silence. Why Vineet&#8217;s work stood head and 
              shoulders above the rest of the works in the show was essentially 
              because he was able to present a ceramic exercise that weaves into 
              its recesses the quiet dignity of a meditative mould. It wouldn&#8217;t 
              be wrong to say that Vineet is indeed the Shoji Hamada of India 
              essentially because he has been able to translate the dictums of 
              indigenous strains and tenets into his ceramic works by giving it 
              a deeply felt reflective rhythm that does not shout but whispers 
              into its abyss of quietude.</p>
            <p> <b>Earthy Tenors</b></p>
            <p> Then there was Abhay Pandit whose small pots and platters spoke 
              of the sand dunes of Rajasthan.He played with the sandy textures 
              of an ochre toned soda firing to give nuanced textures of the play 
              of wind on sand. Between the indigo tinted blues and the encrustations 
              of sandy earthiness some of his works spoke of greater things to 
              come. </p>
            <p>Abhay Pandit:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/abhay_pandit1.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/abhay_pandit1.JPG" alt="Abhay Pandit" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/abhay_pandit3.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/abhay_pandit3.JPG" alt="Abhay Pandit" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/abhay_pandit4.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/abhay_pandit4.JPG" alt="Abhay Pandit" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p align="left">Vinod Daroz disappointed greatly for his repetitive 
              schemations that failed to touch a chord, Jyotsna Bhat the icon 
              of contemporary pottery also disappointed greatly specifically because 
              the works looked old and somewhat uninspiring.</p>
            <p align="left">Vinod Daroz:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vinod_daroz1.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vinod_daroz1.JPG" alt="Vinod Daroz" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/vinod_daroz2.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/vinod_daroz2.JPG" alt="Vinod Daroz" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p align="left">Jyotsna Bhat:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/jyotsna_bhatt1.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/jyotsna_bhatt1.JPG" alt="Jyotsna Bhat" width="193" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/jyotsna_bhatt3.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/jyotsna_bhatt3.JPG" alt="Jyotsna Bhat" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> Yet none of the others could strike a response but actually exciting 
              for its sense of moulding earthy tenors into smoky roughened was 
              the stoneware paper clay with textural glazes of Marcio Mattos who 
              was inspired by the terracotta cups that served tea in Indian trains. 
              Surface texture is the hallmark of his brilliance in handling his 
              works and all his works in the show spoke of an understanding of 
              the lyrical odes to autumn, here was a resistant yet reflective 
              tonality of Shelley&#8217;s autumn leaves metamorphosed into the 
              grains of sand and earth, speaking more in the vein of an Indian 
              raga riveting in its andante which we call alaap. Playing between 
              the inherent strength of blackened hectic sienna rusted tones his 
              work seemed to be only an integration of a warm, fleshy ground is 
              interrupted by pours of colour, splashes and clumps of abstracted 
              color-streaks, which appeal to a sense of visual tactility.</p>
            <p>Kaif Ghaznavi:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/kaif_ghaznavi2.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/kaif_ghaznavi2.JPG" alt="Kaif Ghaznavi" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/kaif_ghaznavi3.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/kaif_ghaznavi3.JPG" alt="Kaif Ghaznavi" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> Romance, violence, eroticism, mystery, nobility, languor, and 
              exoticism delineated the raku fired glazes of Roland Summer who 
              captured an enraptured cloud of infinite silhouettes on his pots 
              and bowls, launching an abiding fascination with the rhythms of 
              nature that infused staid European air-in some ways he brought back 
              the recall of incense wafting through the ambience with his textures. 
              The application of the sense of cloudy texturing in his raku brought 
              on by the carbon markings suggest an innate fluidity that yields 
              a smooth, consistent surface across the image. The continuity of 
              the texturing reveals a softened sensuality that does not overpower 
              but speaks more like a refrain and you realize that in the perfected 
              art of the glaze within the firing Roland is more photographic than 
              painterly, without being stylistically Realist. Seamless and somewhat 
              distinctive in his ability to recreate magic from within and without 
              his ceramic ware were perfect from the inside as well as the outside. 
              For Roland the weaving of carbon is akin to paint-it helps the pot 
              in question to accept &#8212; the mutations of sudden, dramatic 
              and no doubt possible gaps in space. Yet it also suggests the power 
              of the incidental in the act of cooling.</p>
            <p>Roland Summer:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/roland_summer3.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/roland_summer3.JPG" alt="Roland Summer" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/roland_summer2.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/roland_summer2.JPG" alt="Roland Summer" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p><b>Western Ferment</b></p>
            <p> Then there was the woven platter, earthenware dipped and sprayed 
              glaze of Ana Fitzpatrick that spoke of perceived refinement, delicacy 
              and sophistication of civilized Western culture, which held the 
              Orient in its hand as both barometer and shadowbox. Of particular 
              intrigue was her vermillion-toned platter, which held a small bowl 
              within. Fired in that otherworldly, blanching light peculiar to 
              the sunny skies of Italy, the platter itself became a vital destination 
              for Ana&#8217;s artistic pilgrimage. Ana&#8217;s woven platters 
              gave a kind of visual addiction to the harmony of inherent hues 
              of extraordinary convolution.</p>
            <p>Ana Fitzpatrick:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/abhay_pandit4.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/ana_fizpatrick4.JPG" alt="Ana Fitzpatrick" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/ana_fizpatrick5.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/ana_fizpatrick5.JPG" alt="Ana Fitzpatrick" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> Speaking of convolutions, two potters who stood out for the fascinating 
              process that brought them to their end result were Jane Gibson and 
              Janet Mansfield. Jane&#8217;s thrown pots fumed with sulphates in 
              a paper kiln spoke of her intoned ability to understand the workings 
              of smoky embers and the divisional dictums of the co-existence of 
              opposites. Beguiled by both organic and inorganic achievement, the 
              intricate matrix of form and function that propels the natural world, 
              myriad moorings in the coming together of the play of white and 
              blackened calculative tonalities on her pots give them a candidness 
              that echoes not only the brink of alchemy and magic, but also the 
              prescient brilliance and longing to simulate the structures fundamental 
              to the firing performance with paper in the kiln.</p>
            <p>Marcio Mattos:</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/marico_mattos2.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/marico_mattos2.JPG" alt="Marico Mattos" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><a href="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/marico_mattos3.JPG"><img src="images/Elements_Uma-Nair/thumbs/marico_mattos3.JPG" alt="Marico Mattos" width="163" height="150" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> In some ways Janet Mansfield&#8217;s works that tempered the reaches 
              of salt glaze and wood fired techniques took one back to the feverish 
              passages of Antonio Vivaldi's Four Seasons, look deeper and closer 
              and you could detect a hint of micro emulation found in fossilized 
              stained glass cathedral windows in dragonfly wings, fishing nets 
              docked in space with an encrustation of spider webs, Japanese wagashi 
              in cherry blossoms and frozen pine boughs, and an ancient scholar's 
              rocks in pluming smoke and rolling ocean waves.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Critic&#8217;s Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>This show Elements spoke of residual reverberations in time, about 
              nature&#8217;s role in the impregnation of creativity in the world 
              of clay. Certainly in the hands of an adept studio potter a pot 
              can be the result of a ritual that is resonant with in-depth rhythms 
              in the rites of passage. Yet one of the more resonant echoes of 
              the human imperative to venerate nature by virtue of mirroring is 
              what brings about an awakening. In its ability to say so many things 
              Elements evolved in both materials and technique to embody the strongly 
              didactic structure and singular, intrinsic properties of the exploration 
              of ceramics. </p>
            <p>Between sumptuous syncopations, with its refined use of multiple 
              carved patterns to create remarkable depth in the lush masterfully 
              delineated textures and glazes the show oscillated between innate 
              chemistry to mediocre mimicry. Another curious, rather esoteric, 
              parallel can be drawn, owing its analogous properties to the coarse/fine 
              poetry of labor and aging; the passage of time evoked by the human 
              hand is indeed paramount. In clay a compositional maneuver can be 
              revitalizing and refreshing.Considering the vast regal space of 
              the Visual Arts Gallery one would have liked a few more potters,and 
              a few more works.Too few works in such a magnificent space can seem 
              dwarfed.Perhaps a few more names in the Indian ceramic scene would 
              have added both magic and caprice. </p>
