              artists delve into the wrenching subject of suffering. Why look 
              at pain when joy is so much more appealing? Ceramic sculptor William 
              Catling, however, courageously deals with this difficult and sobering 
              subject, for the purpose of healing-to reveal the transcended effects 
              of suffering and affirm the gift of life. 
            <p> <img src="../images/catling1.jpg" width="68" height="135" align="left">Clay 
              is Catling's primary medium. The natural material fuels a dialogue 
              where sculptor's thoughts become mirrored in clay's malleability. 
              As the artist's fingers become one with the clay, as he bends, pierces, 
              and shapes the vulnerable material, an aspect of human angst takes 
              hold and a figure emerges. 
            <p> It all began with a recurring nightmare. Catling would envision 
              an emaciated, powerless woman who was bound, unable to move. Working 
              intuitively, but following the train the dream as leading him to, 
              Catling moved in a new direction. The artist built a female figure 
              and wrapped her in barbed wire, the first work in the series of 
              human vulnerability. What followed was no fantasy. A French collector 
              bought the piece for the Museum of Unknown Jewish Martyrs (the Holocaust 
              Museum) in Paris. It was the beginning of Catling's search to plumb 
              the depths of human agony to reveal how, when faced with the inevitability 
              of suffering in whatever form, rather than wallow in pity, consciousness 
              is capable of rising to a higher level. 
            <p> Fourteen haunting sculptures give the exhibition a solemnity and 
              holiness. One enters in hushed tones as if a religious experience 
              is about to begin. Each figure-engulfed in autumn leaves or twigs, 
              hanging from chains suspended from the ceiling, reclining limply 
              on a bench, girdled in branches, or pinned to the wall-exudes an 
              individual sense of resignation and repose. The naked, almost androgynous 
              figures become spiritual heroes. 
            <p> <img src="../images/catling2.jpg" width="193" height="136" align="left">The 
              San Francisco born Catling is also a poet and finds solace in writing 
              and reading about the human condition. He continually seeks out 
              stories and poems by holocaust victims throughout the ages. The 
              titles of his sculptures are taken from poems written by Holocaust 
              victims of this century. 
            <p> &quot;Shared Suffering&quot; points to the nature of compassion 
              that arises when one human being enters the soul of another to fathom 
              its pain either empathetically or from having a similar experience. 
              "Shared suffering" says Caitling, "unites and bonds one to another, 
              obliterating such differences as age, race, nationality, and creed." 
              In this exhibition the sharing takes place between viewer and art; 
              more subtly, between sculpture and sculpture as viewer and artwork, 
              both become witnesses to suffering and are affected by the depth 
              of emotion that fills the gallery. 
            <p> &quot;Fading into Sighs, Silences, Sufferings&quot; is of a man 
              attached high on the gallery wall. His glorious wingspan might otherwise 
              symbolize soaring; but his wretched body reveals that he is in descent. 
              Earth tone, mud-like natural surfaces gives this figure and all 
              the figures an ageless look, as if they were modeled years before 
              and excavated still wearing the effects of earth in which they were 
              buried. Catling achieves this timeless quality through a simple 
              color palette of black, rust, and ochre, with low fire clay, and 
              glazed stains that complete the work with a hot and cold finish. 
            <p> <img src="../images/catling3.jpg" width="63" height="136" align="right">Catling 
              incorporates natural materials, such as fibers, branches, twigs, 
              and pieces of log, along with the kiln-fired clay, to show how nature 
              and life are so inextricably linked. His earlier figures did not 
              have hands. Rather, he would cut plum tree branches from his garden 
              and arranged them as hands, or as a leg stump, or emerging from 
              the body as wings. Soon, clay limbs began to sprout, along with 
              the addition of thick foliage. In "The Pale God of My Desire," the 
              sculptor burrows the figure in a cage of branches and a large bird's 
              nest. By obscuring the figure, Catling suggests the privacy of suffering 
              and the need to go inward when one suffers. 
            <p> &quot;In the Open Wound the Heart Surrenders,&quot; perhaps one 
              of Catling's most moving forms, a woman squats in labor upon a mound 
              of faces. Her head is bent, her mouth open wide, as if she sustains 
              a long and silent shriek. Her upper body is bound in rust-colored 
              twine. The restraint suggests that her sole focus at the moment, 
              is the pain of childbirth and the joy of what that suffering will 
              bring. 
            <p> Catling, who is a professor at Azusa Pacific College, tells how, 
              when he was installing the exhibition, he first placed the work 
              where he saw fit. Because the forms were created at different times, 
              many had never been in the same room at the same time. Stepping 
              back, Catling marveled at seeing all the work in one place. Immediately, 
              he realized that a dialogue began between the figures, as if new 
              and old friends were becoming acquainted and reacquainted. Catling 
              sensed that the sculptures were telling him where they wanted to 
              be placed. As he listened to their requests, figures were shifted 
              and rearranged in different locations. The sculptor observes that 
              the final exhibition took on a far superior look than he originally 
              had planned and "Shared Suffering" was realized.
