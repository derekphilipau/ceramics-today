              and Life<br>
              by John Balistreri</b></font> 
            <center>

                <p><img src="../images/voulkos2.jpg" width="142" height="206" align="left">Throughout 
                  our working together I was constantly amazed by the depth and 
                  intensity of the intellectual commitment he put into each piece 
                  despite all the social activities and business decisions that 
                  were invariably going on everyday. Over this entire period he 
                  never gave up on or fell short of any piece he made. His production 
                  over the last three years of his life was nothing short of phenomenal. 
                  In addition to the pieces that I helped him with, he was making 
                  at least one or more stacks a year with Peter Callas in New 
                  Jersey; and he also made several other works with the assistance 
                  of Conrad Snyder at Anderson Ranch and Sam Harvey at Alfred. 
                  The energy and stamina he put into his work over this period 
                  of time was prodigious &shy; his mind and body were active. 
                </p>
                <p>In Voulkos' mind, the piece he was working on at the time was 
                  the most important he had ever made &shy; and I believed him. 
                  He was operating on a level of maturity in his art that comes 
                  from a life well lived, from a person who is in touch with the 
                  world. A trait of most artists is an ability to observe what 
                  is around them, and in this Voulkos was no exception. However, 
                  he always went a step further: he engaged life, he lit up a 
                  room, literally and figuratively. He radiated warmth to anyone 
                  that was sincere, engaging everyone and everything that came 
                  across his bow.</p>
                <p>Voulkos was aware of his stature as an artist; he knew that 
                  he possessed a kind of gravity that pulled people toward him. 
                  For his long-time friend Rudy Autio, it was a 50-year journey. 
                  For Jun Kaneko, it started 38 years ago with Kaneko's arrival 
                  to the US. For me it has been 18 years. For my students it was 
                  his last visit to Bowling Green, and for the waitress we met 
                  at Christmas it was only that one time, at dinner. You could 
                  not resist him. </p>
                <p>John Cage wrote Ten Rules and Hints for Students and Teachers 
                  and Anybody Else. Voulkos taught me the last two rules himself: 
                  Number 9 &shy; Be happy whenever you can manage it; enjoy yourself, 
                  it is later than you think. Number 10 &shy; We are breaking 
                  all the rules, even our own rules, and how do we do that? By 
                  leaving room for 'X' qualities. He had a sense of the nature 
                  of things beyond himself and let it come into the work. He absorbed 
                  all of life's moments, from the profound to the absurd. 
                  He lived with it, digested it and then let it out in his work. 
                  I was always searching for his secret, to see if there was some 
                  kind of trick to it, but there wasn't. It was brilliance, 
                  unabashed and rock solid.</p>
