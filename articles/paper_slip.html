              by Steven Goldate<br>
              <br>
              Inspired by a mid 18th century Qing dynasty &#8216;triple&#8217; 
              cloisonn&eacute; vase, I recently embarked on a multi-faceted project 
              that would challenge many of my skills. In the course of this project 
              I acquired some new skills and came up with some &#8211; I hope 
              &#8211; novel solutions to problems that I was presented with. The 
              focus of this article is on the main material I used &#8211; paperslip, 
              and on slip casting in general. 
            <p><img src="images/stevens_paperclay3.jpg" alt="Paperclay bowl by Gaye Stevens" width="210" height="155" align="left">Most 
              people by now would have heard of <a href="../howto/htpaperclay.html"><b>paperclay</b></a>.
              It has been the topic of a number of articles, e.g. by <b><a href="040901a.html">Graham
              Hay</a></b> and <a href="stevens_paperclay.html"><b>Gaye Stevens</b></a>
              and a of couple of books (notably <a href="http://www.atlasbooks.com/marktplc/01005.html"><b>Rosanne
              Gault, <i>Paperclay</i></b></a>). Surprisingly, when I mention to 
              people that I am experimenting with paperslip, they nod in recognition, 
              as if this was a material well known to them. However, I am not 
              aware of many people having experimented with it or published anything 
              on the topic.</p>
            <p><img src="images/paper_porcelain.jpg" alt="bisqued triple-neck vase" width="128" height="142" align="left">So 
              just what is paperslip? Answer: a casting slip, into which a certain 
              amount of paper pulp has been mixed. Why use paperslip? Answer: 
              because of the great drying and gluing qualities it offers, similar 
              to paperclay. In the following, I would like to go into some detail 
              on the advantages, disadvantages (if any) of paperslip and the processes 
              connected with it.</p>
            <p>The problem I was originally presented with was how to make an 
              intersecting three-necked vase from clay, which I had originally 
              seen in cloisonn&eacute;. For the 40-50 cm high piece I was envisioning, 
              casting seemed to be the only viable option. I also decided that 
              some paper pulp added to my slip would improve it&#8217;s workability 
              in the leatherhard to dry state. I set about coil building a model 
              from which I made a two piece mold, that sat on a plaster base. 
              The idea was to cast the pieces in paperslip, then cut the sides 
              at 120 degree angles and glue them together with more slip. In reality, 
              this turned out to be impossible to do. After cutting the sides, 
              the neck&#8217;s weight made it sag slightly to the unsupported 
              side. My necks had to be parallel, so I never made it to the gluing 
              stage with these casts.</p>
            <p>Back to the drawing board. Literally. I decided I would make a 
              new mold from a model that already had the sides &#8216;pre-cut&#8217; 
              at the necessary 120 degrees. This way, the neck would be supported 
              and I could glue the walls together relatively effortlessly. However, 
              this gave rise to another problem &#8211; how to make a model, so 
              that it&#8217;s neck wouldn&#8217;t sag? I ended up making a double-walled 
              vessel, where the neck extended into the belly of the form, down 
              to the base so it was self-supporting. Again, this model was coil 
              thrown.</p>
            <p>The next step was to make the walls. These had to not only be at 
              an angle of 120 degrees to each other, but also perpendicular. To 
              make sure I got these angles right, I constructed a &#8216;gauge&#8217; 
              of sorts. This was made from particleboard with the help of a right 
              angle and compass. After cutting the model&#8217;s belly at roughly 
              120 degrees, I was then able to attach flat slabs fairly accurately 
              with the help of my &#8216;calibrated&#8217; gauge. I wound up with 
              quite a satisfactory model.</p>
            <p>With shrinkage and cracking of coils in mind, I wasted no time 
              in pouring the plaster. I did this using a method shown to me by 
              <a href="../potw/weiser.html"> <b>Kurt Weiser</b></a> of <a href="asu_research_center.html"><b>Arizona
              State University</b></a>. His method is to wait until the plaster 
              starts to stiffen and then to &#8216;slop&#8217; it on the model 
              by hand. Weiser first pours a thin layer over the model to get a 
              really smooth, even coat. Then, using a new batch of plaster, molds 
              this on by hand, immediately after it has started to stiffen. The 
              first thin layer didn&#8217;t work for me. I found it didn&#8217;t 
              adhere to the mold sufficiently, parts sticking to the model and 
              flaking off. I skipped this stage and got a very good surface anyway. 
              I don&#8217;t really want to go into the intricacies of mold making 
              here &#8211; enough has been written about that already. But I do 
              want to talk about cottles.</p>
            <p><img src="images/paper_porcelain2.jpg" alt="computer image of copper red triple-necked vase" width="142" height="184" align="left">What 
              is a cottle? Answer: a cord of some sort, which is tied around a 
              mold so it holds together when you pour the slip in. This usually 
              works fine for small molds. But some molds, like the ones I was 
              working on, took in the order of 30 liters (63 pints) of slip. That&#8217;s 
              probably about 50 kilos (110 pounds) plus the weight of the mold 
              itself we&#8217;re talking about. Having had the experience of losing 
              slip from an insecurely fastened mold, I decided something more 
              efficient was needed. My method consists of drilling holes through 
              the sides of the mold, pushing bolts through and securing these 
              with nuts. Never, ever will a mold come apart again using this method. 
              When designing the mold, it helps to modify the design slightly, 
              incorporating flanges to accommodate the pins. You may also want 
              to embed some rings into the plaster for protection and strength. 
              A good alternative to drilling the holes might be to pour the mold 
              with some dowling in place, which could be easily removed once the 
              plaster has hardened sufficiently. Bolts of just about any length 
              can be obtained from a good hardware store.</p>
            <p>Weiser had told me that it was quite possible to stick pieces of 
              slipcast clay together without any special treatment, but for what 
              I had in mind I was skeptical. Being a fan of paperclay, I thought 
              paperslip would be an ideal material to work with. Paperclay gives 
              greenware great strength, minimizes (if not eliminates) cracking 
              and reduces weight and shrinkage. When making paperclay or paperslip, 
              one of the first considerations is what sort of paper to use. I 
              found that newsprint and office shreddings worked equally well for 
              me. As far as slips go, any commercial or home made slip should 
              work well. Keep in mind that the paper will introduce a small amount 
              of calcium carbonate (used in paper as a filler) to the mix, which 
              may raise the maturation temperature. However, with the quantities 
              of paper I am suggesting to use, this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
            <p>Whichever paper you use, it is important to let it soak for at 
              least a week or two. This helps to break down the fibers. Another 
              option might be to boil the pulp, although I haven&#8217;t tried 
              this yet. Another factor is the size of your pre-pulping paper shreds 
              &#8211; the smaller they are, the finer the fibers of your pulp 
              will turn out. Because we are casting, it&#8217;s better to have 
              smaller fibers that can mix well with the slip, creating as homogenous 
              a mix as possible. Once the paper has soaked long enough, the mixture 
              can be worked on with a drill mixer attachment or blender. This 
              is to further beak down the fibers. (Just down tell your partner 
              you&#8217;re using his/her favorite $90 Braun kitchen blender for 
              the purpose&#8230;)</p>
            <p>After mixing the pulp sufficiently (a matter of personal judgment), 
              it can be put in a kitchen strainer and left to drip-dry for a bit, 
              or some of the water can be squeezed out. This is so that we don&#8217;t 
              introduce too much extra water into our slip. On the other hand, 
              the paper pulp should not be so dry, as to thicken the slip so that 
              loses it&#8217;s easy pouring quality. Add about 10% by weight of 
              medium wet paper pulp to your slip and give it a good mix with your 
              mixer attachment. For paperslip, this amount should be enough. Paperclay 
              can take up to as much as 50% paper content, but with slip, the 
              casting qualities would be reduced considerably.</p>
            <p><img src="images/paper_porcelain1.jpg" alt="computer image of copper red triple-necked vase" width="205" height="270" align="left">Don&#8217;t 
              use new paperslip immediately. The mixing action introduces lots 
              of air bubbles into the mix. When you pour a cast, these rise to 
              the surface and create small bubbles in the walls and on the surface 
              of the piece. These bubbles can eventually lead to pinholing &#8211; 
              not good! For this reason, it&#8217;s a good idea to let fresh paperslip 
              rest overnight. Before using it, mix it by stirring slowly it with 
              a stick, being careful not to introduce any air. Another way of 
              inadvertently introducing bubbles into the slip is by pouring it 
              from a height. The splashes and splatters generated by gravity introduce 
              &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; more air bubbles! The solution is 
              to pour the slip down a slide of some sort, e.g. a piece of plastic 
              pipe, available in various diameters from hardware stores. (Tip: 
              sandpaper the edges, so they don&#8217;t damage your mold&#8217;s 
              surface.) Apart from some of the things mentioned above, general 
              rules of slipcasting apply.</p>
            <p>I was quite happy with the results of my mold and cast. The next 
              stage was to stick three sections together. I scoured the walls 
              of three leatherhard pieces with a sawtooth blade. After brushing 
              on fresh slip, two sides could be joined together, carefully aligning 
              the edges and the inner &#8216;spine&#8217;. The same procedure 
              was followed with the third piece, except that there were four walls 
              to join. This is where you find out if your angles are correct! 
              If there are small gaps here and there between the seams, these 
              can be filled in with slightly stiffened paperslip. This technique 
              proved itself &#8211; not a single crack appeared anywhere. The 
              downside is that the walls can soften too much and make joining 
              difficult. When I tried to join pieces by rewetting the walls after 
              they were bone dry, some small cracks did appear the bisque firing. 
              It might be possible to fill these and re-bisque the piece.</p>
            <p>What I ended up with, was a three-necked, three chambered vase. 
              Later, to save clay, reduce weight (not great in any case) and reduce 
              the &#8216;gluing&#8217; area, I decided to cut out the walls, leaving 
              a one inch rim to join. In this case, I ended up with a three-necked, 
              one-chambered object. Decorating these objects is going to take 
              some thought and will be a challenge. As they are in a sense three 
              independent, intersecting pieces, it would be astute to decorate 
              each one somewhat differently, enhancing it&#8217;s individuality, 
              in contrast to a uniform glaze. However, that may become another 
              story altogether. <br>
