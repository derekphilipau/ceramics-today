            <p><img src="../images/visgirda/visgirda3.jpg" width="140" height="329" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4">In 
              order for an artist’s work to stay current and interesting – both 
              for the viewer and the artist – some change is essential. Sometimes 
              the change is radical, but often it is more subtle. For nearly 30 
              years, the work of Lithuanian-born ceramic artist Rimas VisGirda 
              has been evolving. His ceramic pieces are almost cubist in design, 
              and his unique angular style creates unusual forms on which he paints 
              satiric narratives to describe his vision of life.</p>
            <p>After receiving his MFA in ceramics, VisGirda spent 25 years teaching 
              at colleges and universities. Because he was teaching sculpture 
              and drawing as well as ceramics, his work included all three disciplines. 
              &quot;I found myself drawing or decorating surfaces of the vessels 
              and then I began to change the forms of the vessels – to simplify 
              them and change their shapes – so they would make better surfaces 
              for my drawings.&quot;</p>
            <p>VisGirda’s pieces are complex and his multi-fired processes take 
              time and patience. He prefers high-fire ceramics because &quot;high-fire 
              clay has integrity, and the hardness and depth of surface cannot 
              be duplicated.&quot; He also likes to use a bright palette of colour, 
              which is difficult to achieve in high temperature firing. To create 
              the effect he wants, VisGirda developed a process that combines 
              both high and low-fire and which may require as many as 20 firings.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, VisGirda has involved himself in residency 
              programs at various locations and attended numerous symposiums. 
              &quot;In 1988, I visited the Soviet Union as a guest of the USSR 
              Union of Artists and have been to a number of symposiums in Eastern 
              Europe during the ensuing years. Symposiums, most often held in 
              factories, are an opportunity for me to meet new colleagues and 
              exchange ideas and philosophies, as well as experience a different 
              cultural and social environment.&quot;</p>
            <p>VisGirda states that when he participates in a symposium, he allows 
              the experience to influence his work, both technically and ideologically. 
              &quot;Technically, I experiment with various ways of using the materials 
              available at the particular venue. I try throwing and handbuilding 
              the unfamiliar clays, as well as using pre-made forms available 
              to me at the factories. I also try to incorporate technology available 
              at these factories to create pieces. Ideologically, I try to incorporate 
              the influences of daily life, social interaction and the physical 
              surroundings of the new environment into my work. The visual resolution 
              of the finished work is a combination of past and new experiences.&quot;</p>
            <p>Attending two porcelain symposiums in the Czech Republic during 
              1994 and 1997 brought a new focus to VisGirda’s work. The 1994 symposium 
              was held at the EPIAG-Dalovice Factory in Karlovy Vary, an old resort 
              town, and the 1997 symposium was at LEANDER 1946 in Loucky, a small 
              village about 10 km from Karlovy Vary. </p>
            <p>While working at these factories, VisGirda discovered decals. &quot;I 
              had made some decals a long time ago – back in the ‘70s – but not 
              ceramic decals. When I was at the 1994 symposium, I was snooping 
              around the large factory and found the section which made the decals 
              for the porcelain that was produced in the factory. I asked if they 
              would make a decal for me. The process was technical and I learnt 
              something of the complexities. These decals were strictly for the 
              decoration of souvenirs. I decorated about 80 factory-made demitasse 
              cups with my decals and gave them to the symposium participants 
              and factory workers.&quot; VisGirda and his wife, Billie Theide, 
              attended the 1997 symposium together. &quot;Billie discovered an 
              entire room in this factory filled with drawers upon drawers of 
              decals. Some of the decals dated back to the 1930s and ’40s.&quot;</p>
            <p>VisGirda was drawn to the small flower decals he found because 
              he likes the overall floral pattern of chintz. He hired one of the 
              factory decorators to put these tiny individual decals on one of 
              his pieces. &quot;It probably would have taken me several days to 
              cover that pot. The experienced factory decorator finished it in 
              about an hour and a half.&quot; During this symposium, VisGirda 
              continued to experiment with the decals for background and decoration.</p>
            <p>After VisGirda returned home, he discovered that not only did his 
              interest in using decals continue, but others were also interested. 
              He took the information he already had, experimented, and taught 
              himself more. &quot;I was teaching at the time, and my students 
              also wanted to learn how to make ceramic decals. That’s where it 
              began, and now I am giving workshops around the country.&quot;</p>
            <p>VisGirda has developed a straightforward, simplified approach to 
              making ceramic decals. &quot;I’ve discovered that you don’t need 
              expensive or special equipment. I’ve developed a decal technology 
              that is quick and can be performed economically in a well-ventilated 
              home studio, kitchen or basement.&quot;</p>
            <p>VisGirda’s new work reflects his growing interest in decals. His 
              signature style has not changed but both his own decals as well 
              as commercial decals are now added for background and embellishment. 
              He is also, to a limited extent, using some details in his main 
              imagery.</p>
            <p>According to VisGirda, the major advantage of decals for the ceramist 
              is the ability to transfer one’s own or others’ artwork to ceramic 
              pieces and to replicate that image on as many pieces as desired. 
              &quot;While it takes some time and effort to create the first image, 
              hundreds of exact duplicates can be made instantly. By mixing and 
              matching a number of images on the same piece, a series of ideas 
              or even a complex story can be told easily many times.&quot; VisGirda 
              sees decals as a useful tool to help convey a message or concept 
              through art and engage the viewer’s attention.</p>
