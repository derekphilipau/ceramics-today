        firing is an old firing technique that originated in Europe many hundreds 
        of years ago. Germany is well known for it's salt fired gray and blue 
        stoneware, e.g. it's beer steins. The term refers not so much to the fuel 
        used to fire the kiln, but to the introduction of salt towards the end 
        of a firing to get a so-called 'salt peel' effect. 
      <p><img src="../images/saltpeel.jpg" width="91" height="338" align="left" alt="Typical Orange Peel Effect" vspace="2" hspace="2">Usually 
        done in large wood or gas kilns, salt is introduced into the mature kiln 
        chamber by the pound at the end of a firing. Due to the intense heat, 
        the salt volatilizes and the sodium chloride splits into sodium and small 
        quantities of chlorine gas. The chlorine combines with moisture to form 
        hydrochloric acid which escapes into the kiln atmosphere and exits via 
        the flue, while the sodium combines with aluminum oxide and silica oxide 
        in the clay, forming a glaze on any exposed surface of the work. Often 
        a typical 'orange peel' effect occurs. As the salt creates the glaze, 
        pre-application of glazes is unnecessary, although underglaze decoration 
        may be applied to great effect. Sufficient space should be left between 
        individual pieces, so the salt vapor can circulate freely, reaching as 
        much of the work as possible. 
      <p>Due to the escaping small amount of hydrochloric acid, which is highly 
        toxic, the utmost care must be taken and a good mask with a gas filter 
        (a dust filter is not good enough!) must be worn. 
      <p>The salt kiln should be made from dense, high alumina bricks to resist 
        deterioration from the salt as long as possible. After many uses, a thick 
        layer of salt glaze will form on the surface, virtually fusing the inside 
        of the kiln. This is the natural course of the salt kiln. 
      <p>A typical salt firing may start in the afternoon or early evening. If 
        in a secure environment, the kiln can then be left on overnight to get 
        to mid range temperature, then fired to stoneware temperature the next 
        day. When the kiln reaches <a href="../cones.html"><b>cone 9 or 10</b></a>,
        salt is introduced into the kiln in increments of about half a pound into 
        each available port, while the firing continues. Typically a salt-kiln 
        will have two or more salt ports, where the salt, packed in small paper 
        sachets, can be thrown in. Alternatively a long piece of angle iron serves 
        well to dip the salt deep into the ports. Caution! The salt may splatter 
        out from the port. Thick leather gloves, goggles and possibly a good gas 
        mask should be worn. If the kiln doesn't have special salting ports, the 
        burner ports will have to do. White smoke will billow out from the flue. 
        <img src="../images/salting.jpg" width="271" height="195" align="right" alt="Throwing in salt with angle iron" vspace="2" hspace="2">This 
        smoke contains toxic acid, from the conversion of sodium chloride, silica 
        and water vapor to sodium silicate and hydrochloric acid. The amount of 
        salt thrown into the kiln will depend on the kiln's size, but about 10-14 
        pounds fine salt should be enough for a medium sized kiln. Less is required 
        if it is an older salt kiln, as salt residue will help to get the desired 
        effect. Moisture added to the salt will also help the conversion, but 
        also increases the amount of smoke.<img src="../images/salt_kiln.jpg" width="251" height="279" align="left" alt="The Stack" vspace="2" hspace="2">
