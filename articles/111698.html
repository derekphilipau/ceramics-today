<H3>An Imperial Fascination -- Porcelain </H3>

<P>


<IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T" border=0>he web site for this online exhibition is derived from a catalogue of the same name, which in turn goes back to an exhibition held at <A HREF="http://www.alvr.com"><B>A La Vieille Russie</B></A> in 1991.
<P>
While British porcelain is known the world over, 19th Russian porcelain has also gained world fame. Of course its styles and motifs reflect the culture of that country, despite influences from other European states. Some of the most beautiful and well-known of Russian porcelains are sets commissioned by the Imperial Court at St.Petersburg factories. Today, many of these artifacts can be seen at palace museums in Russia. Peterhof, whence the works of this exhibition came, was one of those imperial residencies.

<A HREF="http://www.alvr.com/pimperial.html"><B>An Imperial Fascination</B></A> is a brief general history of Russian Porcelain, which dates back to Peter the Great (1687-1725), while <A HREF="http://www.alvr.com/pservices.html"><B>Services from the Russian Imperial Palaces</B></A> gives us information on the background and history of the Imperial Porcelain Factory, which was influenced by German, French and other European influences, while at the same time developing its own russian 'imperial' style. One of these services is the <A HREF="http://www.alvr.com/pguriev.html"><B>Guriev Service</B></A>, which was originally intended for state ceremonies and receptions. It was comissioned in 1809 by Count Dmitri Alexandrovich Guriev, who was 'Director of His Majesty's Cabinet' while Alexander I was on the throne. These pieces are lushly decorated with scenes from Russia and are embellished with gold lustre.
<P> The <A HREF="http://www.alvr.com/pcottage.html"><B>Cottage Palace Service</B></A> 
  was produced for the 'Cottage Palace' in Peterhof. Each piece bears the coat 
  of Arms of Alexandria, a sword surrounded by white roses, on a royal blue background. 
  The <A HREF="http://www.alvr.com/pyacht.html"><B>Yacht services</B></A> were 
  made in 1895 to be used on the Imperial yacht 'Shtandart'. All of the pieces 
  of this service bear the yachts emblem. In contrast to the Imperial Factory, 
  the Private Factories made porcelain for the Russian middle-class. 
<P>
This well produced site gives us a fascinating insight into Russian Imperial Porcelain of the nineteenth century.
