            <p>Historical Chinese ceramics have inspired a number of studio potters 
              in the 20th century, particularly in Britain where East Asian ceramics 
              were championed by Bernard Leach and his followers. In the late 
              20th century, Chinese glazes have become part of the standard repertoire 
              for any potter or student of pottery such that many collectors are 
              astounded when they discover that the Chinese stoneware with a 'chun' 
              glaze that they have just handled dates to the 12th century and 
              not 1990. Examples of such fine historical Chinese ceramics can 
              be seen in collections around the world but some of the best are 
              to be found in London at the Percival David Foundation. It is here 
              that potters have found inspiration and one often sees in their 
              work similar characteristics to some of the finest pieces in the 
              museum.<IMG SRC="../images/potw/foley1.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 NOSAVE HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=135 ALIGN=RIGHT> 
            <P>The collection of Chinese ceramics in the Percival David Foundation 
              is one of the most important collections of this nature in the world. 
              Formed by Sir Percival in the early part of this century, the collection 
              dates primarily from the 10th to 18th centuries and was given to 
              the University of London in 1950. As a university collection, the 
              ceramics are used for teaching and are also displayed to the general 
              public. The collection has been an important resource for potters, 
              many of whom have visited the galleries and have come away with 
              a new appreciation of Chinese ceramic technology and aesthetics. 
              One of the most dedicated students of the collection has been Vivienne 
              Foley, a successful studio potter based in London, who has taken 
              the opportunity to study the pieces from both an academic and a 
              practical perspective. Not surprisingly, one sees many echoes of 
              later Chinese porcelain in her work, an influence which she freely 
              acknowledges. <BR>
              Like many potters, Foley was first inspired by the fine Song (10–13th 
              century) ceramics in the David Collection, including the Ru, Jun 
              and Guan wares. Over the years, she has also taken the opportunity 
              to study later Ming and Qing porcelains and the way they are constructed. 
              When handling such pieces, she has often commented on their precision, 
              the even thickness and weight of the wares, and the tactile qualities 
              of the glazes. In her most recent work, one can see these parallel 
              influences of both classic Song ceramics and precise imperial porcelains 
              which are in fact early industrial wares. In both her monochrome 
              white porcelains and black magnesia glazed vessels, the Song appreciation 
              for beautiful, organic forms combined with subtle, wonderfully textured 
              glazes is evident. In addition, like the pieces in the museum, Foley's 
              vessels can also be appreciated as sculpture, though essentially 
              they are functional objects. <BR>
              <IMG SRC="../images/potw/foley2.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 NOSAVE HEIGHT=132 WIDTH=141 ALIGN=LEFT>Foley's 
              preferred medium is porcelain which has the purity and strength 
              necessary to create her characteristic thrown and constructed forms. 
              Many of the vertical forms have bifurcated mouth rims which look 
              modern, almost Memphis in style, but in fact can be traced back 
              to China where often fine ceramics took the forms of silver and 
              other metals which usually had shaped mouth rims. From the 10th 
              century, in metalwork and fine ceramics, one begins to see more 
              complex flower-shaped rims which are reflected in Foley's work. 
              She has often combined these complex rims with tightly constricted 
              necks which are extremely delicate and difficult to produce. Such 
              slender tall necks can be seen on Song ceramics from the Jun kilns 
              in north China but they are usually combined with simple flaring 
              mouth rims. The effect in Foley's work is to create a sense of complex 
              harmony in form rather than simple balance as was the aim of the 
              Chinese potter. In Foley's bowl and dish forms, one is immediately 
              reminded of Chinese ceramics of a later period, notably the Xuande 
              period (1426-35) when bowls were thrown with everted rims and sinuous 
              s-shaped profiles. These bowls were made in large quantities at 
              the Imperial kilns of Jingdezhen for the exclusive use of the court. 
              Foley brings this form up to date with smooth lustrous black glazes 
              that are sometimes embellished with abstract white inlays. <BR>
