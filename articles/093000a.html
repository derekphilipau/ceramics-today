            <p> There are a few steps necessary to making this particular ceramic 
              object. We shall look at them one by one. </p>
            <p><b>Making a Model</b> <br>
              The first step is to make a model of the bottle we want to make. 
              The model should be about 12% larger than the finished product you 
              would like to have, because, as most of you will know, clay shrinks 
              on drying and on firing. The slip we are going to use for this project 
              will shrink about 12%. Make the model out of clay by cutting out&nbsp; 
              a cardboard template for the shape you want to get. This should 
              be a profile, that you can hold up against the model, to see if 
              it has the right shape. Make sure there are no 'undercuts'. Make 
              the model on the potter's wheel, by either throwing it solid, or 
              by coil building or a combination of both. Use any other method 
              if you have one, e.g. you might just find a large glass bottle that 
              you like, and cast the shape from that. Of course then, you will 
              save yourself the work of making the model in clay, but you will 
              still have to fill in any undercuts with clay (typically the bottom 
              of the bottle). 
            <p><b>Making a Two Piece Mold</b> <br>
              Once you have your model, make sure it's top opening is closed. 
              If you are using a glass bottle, plug up the top with a ball of 
              clay. Now you are ready to proceed to the next step, which is making 
              your plaster mold. Make a form out of wooden boards, that will comfortably 
              hold your bottle form, and still have about 1 - 11/2 inches (2.5 
              - 4 cms) space left over. Embed the bottle form half way up in clay, 
              so that you can pour the top half in plaster. Let the top touch 
              one of the walls, when you do this. That will become the opening 
              in which you will pour the slip, once it is all finished. If you 
              are unfamiliar with this technique, please refer to Making a Plaster 
              Mold for more information. When the plaster has hardened (usually 
              it's best to wait overnight), turn the mold around and clear out 
              the clay, that was holding your model, being careful not to damage 
              the model's surface in the process. Every little scratch will show 
              up in the finished mold. Once the clay is removed (it should peel 
              off from the plaster easily enough), you should coat the plaster 
              with several layers of soft soap. Brush this on with a flat brush. 
              Work up a lather and then wipe the surface with a cloth. Do this 
              several times -- the more the better. The plaster should be impregnated 
              with the soap, but don't use soap concentrate, as this could weaken 
              the plaster. Doing this will stop the second layer from sticking 
              to the first, so you can separate the two halves. Don't be too eager 
              to open the mold, it dry out for a couple of days -- this will give 
              the plaster enough time to harden properly. Now you should be ready 
              to separate the two halves, by gently tapping the mold's side with 
              a rubber mallet. Using your hands, pry the two halves apart. If 
              they don't come apart easily, you may need to use a little more 
              force: hammer in a chisel between the two halves, at the seam. Do 
              this on all three sides (not where the opening is), but do it carefully! 
              Once the mold is open, let you model shrink a bit -- it should pop 
              out easily.
