			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">
			Bindapur, because of its proximity to a metropolitan area, is far

			Positioned around the center opening, the potter spins the wheel 
			--then takes 25 seconds to throw the clay rings to a finished neck 
			form. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">It 
			takes one and 1/2 minutes to center the jajar on the wheel, place 
			the clay ring on the neck, spin the wheel, form the neck and remove 
			the vessel from the wheel. Before the day is done, the family will 
			set aside 108 finished jajars to further stiffen overnight... and to 
			dry completely the following day. The wall thickness of the jajars 
			is about 1/4 of an inch...its thinness contributing to rapid drying. 
			The metallic color on the top half of the vessel derives from 
			pulverized mica dusted on the top half of the press mold. Primarily 
			decorative, it also prevents the soft clay from sticking to the 
			mold. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Press 
			molds also-are used to make &#8220;<i><u>surahis&#8221;</u></i>, a vessel for 
			serving water. These are often fired as blackware. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">To fire 
			blackware, cotton waste brought in from outside the village is used 
			as a fuel. It is more expensive than other fuels like sawdust 
			costing eight rupees per firing... but the potters believe it 
			produces better carbonization and richer blacks. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			potters bring baskets of cotton waste and spread it on the bottom of 
			the<i> &#8220;madani&#8221;...</i>the open field firing system which has been 
			used in India for thousands of years. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Four 
			unsuccessful or &#8220;waster&#8221; &#8220;<i>surahis&#8221;</i> from a previous firing are 
			placed in the center of the &#8220;<i>maidani&#8221;</i>. This is the first tier 
			of what will become an open shaft, through which-burning dung will 
			be dropped to ignite the ground layer of cotton waste. &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">About 
			100 to 125 vessels are next placed upright to form a concentric 
			pattern. Another one hundred vessels turned upside down are 
			supported by the vertical necks of the first tier. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			waste product of India's ubiquitous cattle serve as fuel for village 
			India. Called &#8220;<i>gobar&#8221;</i>, it is mixed with straw. Women pat it 
			into flat cakes, then slap them against a wall to dry in the sun. 
			When dry and ready to be used as fuel, the prepared cow dung is 
			called &#8220;<i>upala&#8221;</i>. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Cakes 
			of &#8220;<i>upala&#8221;</i> are placed on the feet of the inverted ceramic 
			vessels. Then two tiers are laid sideways in a concentric pattern 
			around the central shaft and topped with<i> &#8220;upala&#8221;</i>. This is 
			repeated twice more until a total of eight tiers and four layers of 
			cow dung cakes are stacked. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Next &#8220;<i>upala&#8221;</i> 
			is placed in a leaning position around the entire circumference of 
			the &#8220;<i>maidani&#8221;</i>. About 175 pounds of &#8220;<i>upala&#8221;</i> are used 
			for the firing, at a cost in 1980 of 12 rupees, i.e., one and one 
			half U.S. dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The &#8220;<i>maidani&#8221;</i> 
			is now covered with pot shards which help to contain the heat during 
			the firing. Next, rice straw is spread over the <i>maidani</i>, then 
			covered with clay slurry and a layer of dry ash. The clay and ash 
			form a crust to seal in most of the heat during the firing. A space 
			around the bottom left free of clay and ash allows entry of air for 
			combustion. The combustion spreads slowly until the cakes of dung 
			around the perimeter are ignited. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">At 9:30 
			a.m. the following morning, as parts of the clay and ash crust begin 
			to fall away, the potters know the firing is completed in this 
			section. To close the breaks cotton flax is thrown in, then ash from 
			previous firings is shoveled over the flax to seal the carbon. The 
			process is continued for about two hours, with the whole family 
			pitching in. All breaks are repaired as they occur until most of the 
			surface are covered with a final layer of moist ash. Air is sealed 
			out, little or no fuel remains inside. Before noon, sawdust and 
			cotton waste are thrown into each shaft the smoke producing a black 
			surface coloration. The shafts are sealed with ash and the process 
			of carbonization is completed. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">It 
			takes two days for the pots to cool sufficiently so that the <i>
			maidani</i> can be opened and the vessels removed. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">These
			<i>surahi</i> are considered a luxury item. Thus they can be sold at 
			higher prices than pots fired in regular firing. <i>Surahi</i> are 
			placed in the living area and used to pour water for guests. When 
			water is poured rather than dipped from large jars, it is considered 
			more prestigious and polite. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">These 
			potters are Hindus and part of a caste which includes masons, farm 
			hands, and&nbsp; cigarette sellers. It is part of their duty as Hindus to 
			follow the values of their caste. Thus Hinduism has favored the 
			hereditary maintenance of vocation. Indian potters, however, have 
			been hard hit by the decline of traditional forms of patronage, of 
			hereditary services to court and temple. Changes in land tenure have 
			also resulted in the decline of traditional payments in the form of 
			shares from the harvest.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Fatigue 
			is a constant complaint among the Bindapur villagers. They are at 
			work before&nbsp; 7 a.m. and often work into the night. The potters have 
			no regular work week. They work every day except holidays. They 
			celebrate <i>&#8220;holy&#8221;</i>, a joyous festival held to recreate&nbsp; 
			Krishna&#8217;s love play with a group of milkmaids. It is the only day of 
			the year when disrespect can be shown to an employer, teacher, wife 
			or husband. After a period of fun when the social bonds are 
			loosened, people get dressed up and go worship at the temple. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">
			Ceremonies associated with birth, death, marriage and puberty draw 
			the potters away from work. At other times work is stopped because 
			astrological signs are inauspicious, for example when there is an 
			eclipse of the sun. Such respites soon end, however, and these 
			villagers rarely escape the piles of drying clay which dot the 
			landscape. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">In 1980 
			the potters paid a minimum of 120 rupees, or $ 15 U.S. dollars, for 
			a truck load of <i>chikni mitti</i>, a grey-tan clay with good 
			plasticity. The clay is dug, delivered and unloaded by truck <i>
			wallahs, </i>contractors and specialists in the work. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">One 
			method of clay preparation produces a smooth levigated clay. The 
			pulverized clay is transformed into slurry and screened into a 
			trough to settle. The top layer of water is removed and the middle 
			layer of slurry is poured onto clean ground to sun dry to the 
			plastic stage. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">A 
			second method is less time consuming but requires a better quality 
			of clay. When the delivered clay is thoroughly dried, it is spread 
			on clean ground. The women in each family are responsible for 
			pulverizing the clay chunks with a mallet or stick. This 
			accomplished, water is poured over the course clay particles and 
			immediately wedged in to balls about 30 pounds in weight. Indian 
			potters are not concerned with the trapping of air during the 
			wedging process. All pots with few exceptions will be beaten, a 
			process that thoroughly compresses and expels all trapped air.
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			wedged balls are then thrown together to form solid mounds of clay,

			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">To

			with a wire, then wedged again. Inspection of all parts of the clay 
			mass is made possible by a process in which the heel of the hand 
			quickly &quot;sheers&quot; layers of clay. The potter spots all impurities 
			visually and picks them out. The clay is then rewedged without

			LARGE WATER VESSELS OR &#8220;GOALS&#8221;</span></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			potters make large water vessels or <i>&#8220;goals&#8221;</i>, using a 
			combination of throwing and beating techniques. This combination is 
			one of the most interesting and typical features of Indian pottery 
			manufacture&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">All 
			potters use the socketed block wheel. The wheel is twirled counter 
			clockwise with a bamboo turning stick. The throwing head is made of 
			either stone, or more recently, cement. Each house has two or three 
			wheels, each costing in 1980 between 150 and 200 rupees, or $18 to 
			$25 U.S. dollars. Throwing and beating are among the most laborious 
			parts of the potters work. In Bindapur it is exclusively men's work. 
			The momentum of the wheel depends on the weight of the throwing head 
			and the strength and skill of the individual potter. </span></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The

			Inside the vessel, the potter holds an anvil or &quot;<i>pindy</i>&quot;. The 
			potter concentrates on thinning out the thick lower wall of the 
			thrown form. The sequence of &quot;beats&quot; proceeds from base to shoulder, 
			both <i>pindy</i> and paddle exerting an equal opposing force.

			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">In 
			stage two, the potter beats rapidly for one minute to expand and 
			thin the wall of the upper belly and shoulder. In the third stage, 
			the potter reverses the paddle so that the concave surface faces the 
			vessel. The curve of both anvil and paddle now closely match the 
			round surface of the vessel. The potter takes about five minutes to 
			further expand and thin the wall. The vessel is then lifted, the 
			soft clay often buckling, and carried to the yard where it is placed 
			ln a supporting form made from a previously fired vessel to further 
			stiffen. Within a total of ten minutes the potter has completed 
			three of the four stages of beating.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">During 
			the fourth stage the potter holds his anvil or &quot;pindy&quot; by its knob 
			and inserts it inside the vessel. Imperfections, often caused by air 
			trapped in the 'clay, may cause fissures in the form's surface. 
			These can be repaired by the skillful potter by judicious beating.
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			potter must judge the proper moisture content of the clay in order 
			to successfully complete the final beating. Judged sufficiently 
			stiff, the vessel is removed from its supporting form and returned 
			to the &#8220;<i>athura&quot;</i>. Again the action of the anvil on the inside 
			and the paddle on the outside bring the vessel to its final shape. 
			This final beating requires about 2 and 1/2 minutes and is essential 
			to achieve a well shaped globular form. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">A fifth 
			and final treatment is used by many potters. After the final beating 
			the mouth of the pot is sealed by a fired clay lid. The pot is then 
			lifted and firmly jerked, causing the air pressure to expand and 
			further perfect the shape. This technique is peculiar to potters of 
			the North-western region of India. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			sequence of beating is very rapid...about four opposing strikes per 
			second...so that the largest thrown form can be expanded 
			dramatically in one minute. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">This 
			process of beating transforms the initially wheel formed cylinders 
			to three times their original size, results in globular forms of 
			great beauty. It is the result of a well-defined process which is 
			more or less followed by all the potters of India. </span></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The

			family, is a cylindrical 'structure about 6-7 feet in height. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Since 
			potters are paid by the kiln load all Bindapur kilns are built to 
			the same dimensions. The potters build their own kilns using 600-700 
			bricks, broken shards, and clay. The cost of construction materials 
			for the kiln in 1980 was between 600-800 rupees or $75 to $100 U.S. 
			not including labor. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The

			overlap sections of broken shard. Nowadays scraps of sheet metal are 
			used as covering material.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">At 
			present the potter's high initial investment in the kiln as well as 
			general poverty prevents experimentation with either new kiln design 
			or improved designs of existing kilns. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Kilns 
			are designed to use sawdust as fuel. Ten bags of sawdust, bought in 
			by camel pulled carts, are needed to fire a kiln. Normally the cost 
			is 10 rupees a bag, but during the peak season sawdust becomes 
			scarce and the price rises to l2 rupees. At present the potters have 
			no methods to buy or store sawdust when the supply is good and when 
			the prices are lowest. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">As 
			firing commences, the potter creates a low temperature inside the 
			kiln with sawdust sprinkled on burning cow dung. This completely 
			dries the greenware vessels. During the peak season of summer the 
			firing continues into the night. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			potters must throw handfuls of sawdust continuously for a period of 
			four or five hours. As the temperature rises the heat and dust make 
			the job unbearable. To continue firing, family members relieve each 
			other at ten minute intervals. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Unlike 
			the<i> </i>open field system of firing which proceeds on its own, 
			the <i>bhati</i>&nbsp; must be tended every moment. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">At 
			present the potters are limited to the lowest firing temperatures. 
			Combustion of hand thrown sawdust is inefficient compared to western 
			methods of power injection of sawdust. Temperatures can never exceed 
			1200 to 1300 degrees Fahrenheit, i.e., bonfire temperatures.&nbsp; </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Fired 
			in the evening a kiln can be unloaded the next morning. The quick 
			cooling cycle of the &#8220;<i>bhati&#8221;</i> is an advantage relative to the 
			two days firing necessary for large open field firing. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">The 
			pots, tossed out of the &#8220;<i>bhati&#8221;</i>&nbsp; with seeming carelessness, 
			are caught with assurance and stacked on the ground in preparation 
			for loading. The payment in 1980 for the fired contents of one kiln 
			is 300 rupees, or $37 U.S. dollars. Of this 143 rupees, almost $18 
			U.S. dollars must be deducted for the cost of clay, sawdust, 
			colorants, and loss through breakage, leaving a final profit of 157 
			rupees --less than 20 U.S. dollars in 1980.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black">Since 
			the kilns are fired on the average of every eight days the average 
			daily return per family is about is about eighteen rupees, i.e., 
			2.35 U.S. dollars,&nbsp; Given the average family size, this would 
			produce an average daily wage of less than five rupees or under 60 
			U.S. cents. The pots are sold to private merchants who send lorries 
			or carts to the colony. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Difficult as it is, their 
			work is considered sacred, with certain tasks ordained by Hindu law. 
			Only men are allowed to throw at the stick-turned stone wheels; only 
			women decorate the ware with prescribed religious symbols. The

			a direct intervention by the divine being. </span></p>
