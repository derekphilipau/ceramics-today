              Gilhooly's exhibition (jointly with Roy De Forest's works on canvas 
              and paper) &quot;<b>Frogs and Dogs</b>&quot; at Arizona State University 
              Art Museum featured ceramic sculpture from the mid 60s to the mid 
              80's. You could call it a 'retrospective'. Early works include pieces 
              that strikingly look like they were made of wood, metal or bone, 
              such as the work 'Hardware Store Indian' or 'The Early American 
              Hunter'. These works are indicative of the style Gilhooly was to 
              develop in the mid seventies. </p>
            <p>As you first enter the exhibition, you are greeted by a grinning, 
              Acimboldo style self-portrait, made of various vegetable and food 
              matter (ceramic of course). Further on, one notices that Gilhooly 
              seems to have two main obsessions or fetishes: food and animals, 
              and he combines these two beautifully in his sculptural work. In 
              the animal kingdom, it's frogs (particularly green ones) and dogs, 
              that dominate. In the food section it's hamburgers and other fast 
              food products. In Gilhooly's world, green frogs end up in frying 
              pans, hamburgers morph into 2 foot giants and may find themselves 
              at the helm of Viking boats. While the frogs feature prominently 
              in this world, so do dogs, which are represented with three life-size 
              sculptures, 'Puppy with Ball', 'Max' and 'Fifi', all made in 1988 
              -- must have been a dog kind of year -- &quot;<i>...or at least 
              a latter dog year, the last time I did dogs having started making 
              them in the mid 60's -- my first was Roy's dog King. After that 
              Roy began making dogs too</i>.&quot; (Quote in italics). 
            <p>Technically Gilhooly's work is excellent -- the surfaces range 
              from realistic looking bread to sausages, eggs or cheese, all achieved 
              with fabulous glazes and not, as one might think underglazes or 
              china paints. This is the work of a glaze master. Quote: &quot;<i>All 
              commercial glazes, especially Mayco and Reward glazes with a rare 
              smattering of Duncans thrown in -- no underglazes and few china 
              paints though I would use some UGs as stains under clear glazes 
              for highlighting, sponging off the extra, leaving only the black 
              in the cracks</i>.&quot;
            <p>My favorite pieces are the boxed works '10lb Gilhooly Sampler', 'Gilhooly's 
              Coffee Break Selections' and 'Gilhooly's Breakfast Variety Pack', 
              all of 1989 (the year of the box?). These works are beautifully 
              boxed collections of small sculptures ( about 1-1.5 inches) of 'ceramic 
              confection', ceramic cups and beverages' and 'ceramic bowls of cereal'. 
              They belong to a numbered limited edition of &quot;portfolios&quot; 
              made in 1989. Quote:&quot; <i>...all done in 1989 -- see the beautiful 
              repro in the recent LACMA catalog-that's Los Angeles County Musueum 
              of Art -- boxes were made and designed by Phillip Kuznicki of Oakland, 
              California.......I also did, after the ten pound sampler, a five 
              pound sampler and a 1 pound sampler</i>.&quot; 
            <p> Gilhooly gave up clay in 1995 to work on his &quot;shadow boxes&quot;.
