              As told by Joseph Marryat<a href="#biblio">*</a> 
            <p><br>
              <img src="images/horse_rider.jpg" width="200" height="218" align="left">We 
              are not told what kaolin B&ouml;ttger employed in his first essays, 
              but the kaolin of Aue, the basis of Saxon porcelain, was discovered 
              by a singular chance. In 1711, John Schnorr, one of the richest 
              ironmasters of the Erzgebirge (Germany), when riding on horseback 
              near Aue, observed that his horse's feet stuck continually in a 
              soft, white earth, from which the animal could hardly extricate 
              them. 
            <p>The general use of hair-powder at that time made it a considerable 
              object of commerce, and the idea immediately suggested itself to 
              Schnorr that this white earth might be employed as a.substitute 
              for wheat flour, which was then used in its composition. He carried 
              a specimen to Carlsfeld, and had a hair-powder prepared, which he 
              sold in great quantities at Dresden, Leipzig, and other places.
            <p><img src="../images/odd/bottger.gif" alt="Johann Friedrich B&ouml;ttger" width="56" height="66" align="left">B&ouml;ttger 
              used it among others, but remarking on the unusual weight of the 
              powder, he inquired of his valet whence he had procured it. Having 
              ascertained that it was earthy, he tried it (as an ingredient in 
              his trials), and to his great joy found that he had at last gained 
              the material necessary for making white porcelain. The kaolin continued 
              to be known in commerce under the name of &#8216;Schnorrische weisse 
              Erde&#8217; &#8211; Schnorr&#8217;s white earth. Its exportation 
              was forbidden under the severest penalty and it was carried to the 
              manufactory in sealed barrels by persons sworn to secrecy. 
            <p> B&ouml;ttger's discovery soon became the object of the most lively 
              jealousy, and it was equally natural that every means to obtain 
              the secret should be tried by other nations, as it was that the 
              Elector should take every precaution to keep it to himself. Strict 
              injunctions to secrecy were enjoined upon the workmen, not only 
              in regard to strangers, but also towards their comrades, but notwithstanding 
              this, even before B&ouml;ttger's death, one of the foremen had 
              escaped from the manufactory and gone to Vienna, and from that city 
              the secret spread over Germany, and many rival establishments were 
              set on foot. </p>
