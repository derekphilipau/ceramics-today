<H3>DIY Fast Firing Kiln Design III</H3>

Dateline: 12/28/98 
<p> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T">his additional info 
  on the DIY Fast Firing Kiln Design instructions is a modification which will 
  greatly improve the qualities of this kiln type. One drawback of this design 
  has shown itself over years of firing, and that is that the bricks tend to move 
  slightly and eventually bulge slightly into the interior of the kiln. A space 
  between the outer and inner layers of brick develops, which is conducive to 
  heat transfer -- meaning that heat is lost. This gap can also possibly be a 
  problem when reducing the kiln, as air tends to get sucked in through the gaps 
  and exact control of the reduction becomes difficult. However, these are problems 
  that appeared only after several years of heavy use! 
<P> Another modification I am suggesting is to place both burners at the flue 
  side of the kiln, instead of at diagonal corners. At art college, the technician 
  there suggested that diagonal placement would give the most even heat in the 
  kiln, however I am not so sure about this any more. In theory, the flame is 
  meant to swirl around the kiln interior in a whirlpool-like fashion, distributing 
  the heat. However, it has been my experience that the flame from the burner 
  opposite the flue sucks a lot of the oxygen from the air entering from the flue, 
  creating an oxidized area, while the rest of the kiln is reducing. How do I 
  know this? Oxidized and reduced bricks on the floor of the kiln have a very 
  revealing story to tell! With both burners at the flue end, the flames will 
  shoot away from the flue, move upwards and arch back down towards the flue. 
  This should also give a more even heat. 
<P> The next modification is to put up calcium-silicate sheeting as outer walls, 
  holding the outer layer of bricks in place. The kiln will look a lot neater 
  too. Next, a layer of medium temperature kiln fiber between the outer and inner 
  layers of brick will make the kiln much more efficient, as heat loss will be 
  reduced greatly. In theory, hot-face fiber could be used on the interior of 
  the kiln, however, I do not appreciate kiln designs with exposed fiber walls. 
  The fiber tends to become very brittle with use and it is near impossible to 
  stop fiber particles entering the atmosphere during firings and when loading 
  and unloading the stack. Unless you want to continuously wear a mask when handling 
  the kiln, you would be exposing yourself to quite dangerous fiber particles. 
  These particles are on a similar to asbestos -- not very nice. In Australia, 
  there has been talk about banning the use of fiber blanket altogether. However, 
  if the fiber is wedged between two layers of brick, and thus not exposed to 
  the air and/or mechanical friction, there is little danger. To save stacking 
  space, you might want to reduce the thickness of the cold-face brick by about 
  a quarter of an inch, to compensate for the fiber thickness. The insulation 
  qualities of the fiber will more than compensate for the loss in brick thickness. 
  Actually, you could possibly leave out the cold-face brick altogether, and just 
  use the calcium-silicate sheeting with the fiber and hot-face brick, laid onto 
  the broader side. However this type of wall is probably not suitable for long 
  firings at high temperatures, due to eventual heat loss. 
<P> The last modification is to stop the bricks moving by gluing them together 
  with fireclay, ceramic brick cement or a mixture of the two.
