              lmost synonymous with the name Wedgwood has become his famous 'blue 
              and white' ware or 'Jasper Ware'. Jasper Ware was made from a clay 
              body invented and tested by Wedgwood himself, unlike his previous 
              clay bodies which were largely improvements of recipes already being 
              used in English potteries. It took Wedgwood several years to come 
              up with the well-known result, which was first introduced in 1774. 
              Part of Wedgwood's success, particularly when one thinks of the 
              'Jasper Ware', lies in the fact that he was quite secretive about 
              tests and ingredients of this and other clays he experimented with. 
              Today we know that barium sulphate was the important new ingredient 
              in 'Jasper Ware' making it different to other clay bodies. Wedgwood 
              dared not have the substance delivered directly to his 'Etruria' 
              factory, but rather had it sent to London, where it was ground to 
              a powder in order to disguise it and only then sent to Staffordshire. 
              He also made sure that his employees didn't know too much about 
              the processes they were involved in by giving them specialized tasks 
              and discouraging contact between different departments. 
            <p> The The Jasper Ware body itself was a pure white, but could be 
              colored in numerous ways. Usually it was colored a light to medium 
              blue, with pure white bas-relief ornaments added. These would be 
              made in separate molds and carefully attached with slip at the leather-hard 
              stage. The piece could then be fired to vitrification point, without 
              the need for a glaze (due to the so-called self-glazing effect of 
              the clay). The designs Wedgwood first used were similar to those 
              seen on the Black Basalt. At later stages, particularly after the 
              death of his partner Thomas Bently, the classical designs became 
              less rigid and new artists began to incorporate themes taken from 
              popular novels, which were a novelty on the rise at the time (late 
              1770's &amp; 1780's). 
            <p> For some time Wedgwood had been trying to gain the acceptance 
              of architects in utilizing his products instead of imitations of 
              classical works in stone and plaster. He began to produce large 
              plaques in the 'Jasper Ware', with classical motifs such as 'The 
              Apotheosis of Homer', with which he tried to gain entry into the 
              realm of architecture and interior design, but famous architects 
              and builders of the time, e.g.. Capability Brown or James Wyatt 
              complained that the ware bore too little resemblance to natural 
              stone. Ultimately Wedgwood didn't succeed in this endeavor, natural 
              or artificial stone remaining the more popular building material. 
              Despite this, there was a long list of items which were made in 
              the 'Jasper Ware', including cameos, seals, medallions, candlesticks, 
              tea-ware and even busts. 
            <p> After the death of his partner Bentley in 1780, Wedgwood rushed 
              to release a new range of Jasper Ware, to counter rumors that he 
              would not be able to manage the firm single-handedly. This new range 
              of products was shown in 1782 and proved his critics to be wrong. 
            <p> In 1783, perhaps at the height of his career, Wedgwood was awarded 
              membership in the illustrious Royal Society, an association founded 
              in the 17th century England by Charles II, which promoted research 
              in the sciences. This honor he gained for his invention of the pyrometer, 
              a still widely used device for measuring temperatures in pottery 
              kilns today. 
            <p> Today, authenticating original Wedgwood ware is done with the 
              help of <a href="http://www.netcentral.co.uk:80/steveb/auth.html">
              <strong>Signature Marks</strong></a>, which Wedgwood used from as 
              early as 1759. 
            <p> Wedgwood continued to produce ceramic wares and to explore new 
              techniques until his death in 1795. His work and art still has many 
              admirers and followers today, e.g. the <font size="2"><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ma/wsb/index.html"><strong>Wedgwood
