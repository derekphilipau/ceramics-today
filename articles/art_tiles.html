              Article by <a href="http://www.mountainpathstudio.com/">Philip Read</a> 
            <p><img src="images/art_tile1_sm.jpg" alt="Art tile by Philip Read" width="128" height="200" align="left">Art 
              Tiles are so described as to differentiate the hand-made/hand-painted 
              tiles from the die cast mass-produced tiles. Tiles have had a long 
              history of artistic and creative design. Currently, the social perception 
              of the term &#8216;tiles&#8217; has relegated the industry to an 
              inexpensive commodity status indicating a separation from the high 
              arts. This has not always been the case, the introduction of the 
              machine produced tiles witnessed the gradual decrease of the hand 
              as playing a major role in the production or painting of the tiles. 
              In the 1840&#8217;s the &#8216;dust-pressing&#8217; a method that 
              consisted of compressing nearly dry clay between two metal dies 
              revolutionized the tile making industry. Dust pressing replaced 
              tile-making by hand with wet clay, and facilitated the mechanization 
              of the tile-making industry. </p>
            <p>Today, artisans use the term Art Tiles to identify their tiles 
              as hand-made, hand-prepared and hand painted. This means that all 
              tiles are made from wet clay and are individually prepared for painting 
              by smoothing the surface and edges. The decoration is applied by 
              hand techniques such as brush, scraffito, luster, tube and transfer 
              printing. </p>
            <p><b>Historical Context</b><br>
              The history of tiles is truly a global affair. Tiles can be traced 
              back at least 4000 years into areas of China, Persia, Greece, Egypt, 
              Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) and Europe through Spain and Italy. 
              They have been excavated at the pyramids, the ruins of Babylon and 
              ruins of the ancient Greek cities. Tiles were originally used to 
              beautify living spaces and were applied on walls and floors. Early 
              designs exhibited decorations of white and blue stripes and later 
              exhibited a wider decoration of patterns and colours. A fine white 
              stoneware with glaze was found from the Shang-Yin Dynasty of China, 
              1523&#8211;1028 BC.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/mesopotamian_tile.jpg"><img src="images/mesopotamian_tile_sm.jpg" alt="Mesopotamian tiles" width="114" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/persian_tile2.jpg"><img src="images/persian_tile2_sm.jpg" alt="Persian tile" width="101" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/persian_tile.jpg"><img src="images/persian_tile_sm.jpg" alt="Persian tile" width="89" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>In the 10th and 11th Centuries a process that included a glassy 
              layer over the clay was developed in Mesopotamia, Persia and Egypt. 
              Families of potters moved to Spain from the Andalusia hub and Mediterranean 
              strip of the Iberian Peninsula. This tile method was introduced 
              to Europe with the Arab invasion of Spain where we still see the 
              architectonic application of tiles on the greater mosque of Seville 
              of the 12th century. Incredible architectural examples of Arab building 
              tiles can still be seen throughout Spain especially at the Alhambra. 
              Spain and Italy were prime markets for the development of tiles 
              in Europe specifically in the 14th and 15th centuries. At this time 
              the hand made production of tiles required an extremely specialized 
              division of labour that involved tile makers and tile decorators. 
            </p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/mosaic.jpg"><img src="images/mosaic_sm.jpg" alt="Alhambra mosaic" width="170" height="75" border="0"></a> 
            </p>
            <p>Towards the 1500 the cities of Seville and Toledo took over the 
              production of tiles. These cities developed new techniques for the 
              making of tiles; they are credited with the appearance of the first 
              mass production process. </p>
            <p>During the 1840&#8217;s the tile industry was revolutionized by 
              the &#8216;dust pressing&#8217; method that consisted of compressing 
              nearly dry clay between two metal dies. Subsequently, in the 19th 
              Century and beginning of the 20th century, the tile industry entered 
              a pre industrial stage that greatly increased the mechanized production 
              and volume of tiles. </p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/art_nouveau_tile1.jpg"><img src="images/art_nouveau_tile1_sm.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau tile" width="100" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/art_nouveau_tile2.jpg"><img src="images/art_nouveau_tile2_sm.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau tile" width="100" height="100" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Prior to the 1840&#8217;s, tiles were hand-made, that is to say, 
              that each tile was hand-formed and hand-painted making each tile 
              a work of art in its own right. Today, ceramic tile is not hand-made 
              or hand-painted for the most part. Automated manufacturing techniques 
              are used and the human had does not enter into the picture until 
              it is time to install the tile.</p>
            <p>The introduction of the term Art Tile in the last 20 years is meant 
              to promote the individual tile artist who still uses the hand to 
              make, form and decorate the tiles. This term distinguishes the small 
              studio tile artist from the mass produced industrial tile and promotes 
              the return of the labour intensive artistic method of making tiles. 
              Some tile artists will purchase standard mass produced bisque or 
              glazed tile and then hand-paint the decoration. Other artists chose 
              to hand-make, prepare and hand-paint the individual tiles. This 
              later choice greatly increases the individual tile labour and dramatically 
              impacts the volume of tiles produced. However, this later method 
              uniquely individualizes each tile as a work of art, thus the Art 
              Tile. </p>
            <p><b>Personal Style and Technique</b><br>
              <a href="images/art_tile2.jpg"><img src="images/art_tile2_sm.jpg" alt="Art tile by Philip Read" width="139" height="200" border="0" align="left"></a>I 
              chose to work only in ceramic porcelain clay; it is the smoothest 
              of clay bodies and is excellent for painting. This choice started 
              for me in 1995 when I went to the ancient city Jingdezhen, China 
              to study painting and tile making with the many studio artists who 
              still use the hands to make and decorate tiles. Jingdezhen has been 
              the center of porcelain clay production for the past 1000years due 
              to the abundant supply of Kaolin clay which is unique to the production 
              of the white clay body. I was especially interested in the large 
              tiles of 20&#8221; to 24&#8221; which offered a large smooth surface 
              to paint on. All of my large tiles are hand made and hand prepared. 
              I do not use a slab roller and maintain the thickness around one 
              centimeter or 3/8&#8221; to &frac12;&#8221;. Although this is a 
              labour intensive process and fragile method I have been able to 
              develop a success rate above 90% after firing.</p>
            <p> The drying process takes up to three weeks and is a critical stage 
              in the survival of the tile. During this drying period I have developed 
              a series of coverings to slow down the dry rate that can lead to 
              cracking and warping. After the tile has dried completely I can 
              then start the painting process. I only work with Green Ware, no 
              pre firing bisque because I have found that the dry clay has absorbency 
              similar to paper. My painting technique is a combination of Eastern 
              and Western brush applications. These brush techniques often require 
              a series of dabs rather than a drawing stroke, the difference develops 
              a layering process that will not smear or create smudge appearances. 
              Of course, the detail work requires the delicate brush stroke application. 
              I have found that this combination of dabs and drawing strokes gives 
              me the maximum freedom of expression over a broad range of composition. 
              My palette includes cobalt blue, under glaze colours, and glazes 
              in combinations that enrich the aesthetic beauty of the artwork.</p>
            <p> Once the tile painting is complete I apply a clear glaze over 
              the top and move to the kiln stage. The Kiln stage is a very critical 
              stage for the success of the large 24&#8221; green ware tiles. Moving 
              the large green ware tiles to the kiln shelves is a very delicate 
              and cautious stage, they can break very easy.</p>
            <p> My firing process involves both vertical and horizontal firings. 
              I use a gas fired reduction firing and/or an electric oxidation 
              firing. Typically, I once fire up to 1350&#8217;c and then may have 
              2-4 subsequent firings including vertical firings.</p>
            <p> I chose to hand-form, prepare and hand paint all of my porcelain 
              tiles. As a small studio artisan I can never compete with the large 
              mass-producing tile companies. Art Tiles currently have a niche 
              market and serves customers who wish to have a unique one of a kind 
              artwork to decorate their home. </p>
            <p><img src="images/art_tile3.jpg" alt="Art tile by Philip Read" width="128" height="193" align="left">I 
              often describe my art making as painting with powdered glass suspended 
              in water. My painting style is somewhat unorthodox and took me over 
              5years to develop. It is a brush application technique of dabbing 
              and layering that results in the glaze melting and fusing into unexpected 
              and exciting pools of liquid glass. These translucent layers of 
              glass fuse onto the white porcelain clay and result in images of 
              soft and strong colour compositions. My paintings are the influence 
              of Western techniques (watercolours, oil, acrylic painting techniques) 
              and Eastern techniques (ink and wash paintings on rice paper) combined 
              with the aesthetics and philosophies of cross culture studies.</p>
            <p><b>Aesthetics of Pleasure</b><br>
              The aesthetics of our personal environment is an important issue 
              in the emergence and continuing development of Art Tiles. The aesthetics 
              or beauty of an artwork responds to the individual&#8217;s pleasure 
              principle and an emotion is evoked. An emotional relationship is 
              formed, a bond of pleasure. Works of art provokes emotion and all 
              of us react accordingly to specific compositions. However, when 
              works of art are perceived to be commodity the relationship changes 
              to one of decorative function the emotion is removed from the observation 
              and the relationship remains formal. </p>
            <p>Craft is often described as the production of a thing having characteristics 
              that could be shared by other things. This sharing evokes a general 
              emotion and not a specific emotion as evoked by an individual work 
              of art like a painting or sculpture. Art Tiles have a limited niche 
              market primarily due to cost. The Art Tiles are sold as works of 
              art and are priced accordingly. They are not made to compete directly 
              with the mass produced tiles but are sold to accent living spaces 
              surrounded by inexpensive mass produced tiles. As such, someone 
              will purchase individual tiles because of there beauty and aesthetic 
              appeal but that is the beauty of Art Tiles; affordable, beautiful, 
              archival (another loaded word), and durable.</p>
