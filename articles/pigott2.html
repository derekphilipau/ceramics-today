                    Sometimes the colour, shapes, juxtapositions and jostlings 
                    suggested more of a street theatre than a silence. Character 
                    and animation came into play; I titled them Jug Parade, and 
                    Parade with Yellow Cup. Not long ago, I made two lines of 
                    small, anonymous table pots; one of 19 pieces, the other of 
                    23. The pots have a certain squareness, flat to the ground. 
                    The rims are fine but have no flare. There is some colour, 
                    some leaning towards movement but the mattness suggests quiet. 
                    I saw a displacement: images of re-settlement, border crossing, 
                    refuge-seeking. I called them Exodus.</P>
                  <P align="left"> In the catalogue of the recent Crafts Council 
                    of Queensland Touring Exhibition, Objects of Ideas, I try 
                    to explain why they move me: Pots, useful, everyday, ordinary 
                    pots, have for most of my life been my daily pleasure mines. 
                    Crowding the kitchen shelves, focusing the mind during a coffee 
                    conversation, letting the eye rest on considered form, on 
                    tenuous line, on languidness, on simplicity, on offered optimism; 
                    inviting the hand to cup, the finger to outline a rim, the 
                    lip to brush. They have become... my companions; and each 
                    meal or smoko I make a choice, inviting the pot like a friend, 
                    and seeing, perhaps, something about it I had overlooked in 
                    the rush.</P>
                  <P align="left"> Beauty, and our response to it, remains a mystery. 
                    But, it seems to me that, in the alchemy of making, the pot 
                    becomes subtly humanised. It is as though a kind of knowing 
                    – a history of understanding, and a sort of longing is translated, 
                    through care and consideration, and an intimate connecting 
                    with the stuff under our fingers... into a form with an independent 
                    life. With its own power to move.</P>
                  <P align="left"> So we speak of pots as though they are animate; 
                    we call them gentle or generous or strong or vulnerable... 
                    a straggling line of jugs, cups and tumblers become an assorted 
                    tribe journeying somewhere. A silent line of porcelain beakers 
                    waits in a window for the light to hit their rims and their 
                    ordinary beauty to become radiant.</P>
                  <P align="left"> Of course, they are still just pots that some 
                    days we might not look at twice. But they have, for a moment, 
                    pulled on our attention, with, perhaps, a reminder of our 
                    own vulnerability, and beauty and possibility of transformation 
                    and repose. Good.</P>
                  <P align="left"> I explain to curators that my pots must be 
                    grouped in that order, leaderless, uncomfortably close but 
                    quiet: I ask that they are shown at a certain height, so that 
                    the glimpses of the interiors become finely outlined, hanging 
                    ovals of colour. I supply snapshots of the arrangement; insisting 
                    on that angle of vision. I ask that a group of Limoges porcelain 
                    beakers is lit from behind, if possible with natural light.</P>
                  <P align="left"> I am quite pedantic about display, and about 
                    photography. When I see (as often) work shown low down, so 
                    that the darker interior colours become uneasily dominant 
                    or the tension of the spacing is lost, I am disappointed and 
                    want to disown the work. In fact, it is not my work. It is 
                    made for a certain eye level; spaces between the pots have 
                    a meaning; group dynamics come into play and a Promenade can 
                    be either a shuffle or a strut according to the choreography. 
                    I prefer the shambling and distrust design.</P>
                  <P align="left"> I know this is perverse. The pots are not fixed. 
                    Nothing holds them together but suggestion. I try to control 
                    their public face but, after that, who knows how they are 
                    changed and arranged and used. I let them go. Some new works 
                    are more specific in their reference to families. They are 
                    rather pale, like memories: matt like frescoes. The first, 
                    Procession, was made after my father's funeral. The others, 
                    like some recent Still Lifes have more than one suggested 
                    arrangement. There might be a group of pots posed as families. 
                    Their references are intimacy and distance. A recent grouping 
                    of 14 bottles, four jugs and tall beaker (from Somatic, Ivan 
                    Dougherty Gallery, March, 1997) is called Waiting. Groups 
                    within groups huddle or stand aloof.</P>
                  <P align="left"> In her catalogue statement for the exhibition, 
                    Objects of Ideas, Susan Ostling wrote: &quot;Placed on tables 
                    or shelves, objects are always, I think, in waiting. They 
                    are performers in an event that has just occurred, or will 
                    occur. They are outlines of objects or blanks waiting to be 
                    filled with association. There is a vulnerability about them 
                    and all their idiosyncrasies are there to see. They are intended 
                    to trigger, or generate many scenarios.&quot; The works are 
                    called Object-stages, composed of small stages and object-players. 
                    The catalogue shows a wavering, thinly-worked wide-mouthed 
                    jug, as monumental as a tree trunk, on an upturned rigorously 
                    simplified tray, one of several 'stages'. I am impatient to 
                    see it in the flesh. The words, describing her work exactly, 
                    might have been about mine. The similarities in our approach 
                    please me. But it is the difference which is the most exciting, 
                    forcing new connections, and appreciations. Recognitions and 
                    surprises reinforce, and challenge, and always lead me back, 
                    grateful, to my workshop.
