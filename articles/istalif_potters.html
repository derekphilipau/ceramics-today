              by Noah Coburn and Ester Svensson <br>
            <p><i><br>
              The Turquoise Mountain Foundation is a non-profit, non-governmental 
              organization which invests in Afghanistan&#8217;s traditional crafts, 
              historic building and landscapes in order to preserve cultural heritage, 
              improve living conditions and create economic opportunities. The 
              Turquoise Mountain Foundation believes that the preservation of 
              Afghan culture is vitally and urgently linked to the country&#8217;s 
              much needed economic, social and urban regeneration. The Foundation 
              currently has a ceramics school in Kabul and a Resource Center in 
              the town of Istalif, where Afghan potters come daily to learn safer, 
              more effective techniques. The aim of the Turquoise Mountain&#8217;s 
              work is not to alter traditional skills, but to preserve Afghanistan's 
              crafts while opening them to wider markets. <a href="http://www.turquoisemountain.org"><b>www.turquoisemountain.org</b></a>.</i><br>

              is a city teeming with construction. Returning refugees contribute 
              to the sprawl of the city, while international companies and governmental 
              organizations build taller and taller buildings downtown. Infrastructure 
              struggles to keep pace; water and electricity are scarce, traffic 
              crawls down unpaved streets and even the richest neighborhoods lack 
              plans for sewage. Outside of Kabul the pace of life is slower. Traditional 
              towns and villages have changed little in the past hundred years. 
              Reconstruction and the impact of foreign aid have been minimal and 
              much of the country struggles with poverty and hunger. </p>

            <p><img src="images/istalif/istalif2.jpg" width="221" height="166" align="left">Areas 
              such as the Shomali Plain north of Kabul were devastated by fighting 
              with the Taliban and have been very slow to rebuild. Many of these 
              towns have struggled to reconstruct themselves and have been forced 
              to find their own means of economic development. For Istalif, a 
              town an hour and a half north of Kabul, in the foothills of the 
              Hindu Kush, this means returning to their traditional crafts to 
              drive their own rebuilding process. Istalifi potters in particular 
              have come back to rebuild their kilns and return to methods of potting 
              which have been passed from father to son for generations.</p>
            <p>Istalif has long been renowned for its gardens and traditional 
              crafts. The Empire Babur praised the beauty of Istalif&#8217;s gardens. 
              Before the Soviet invasion, Istalif was a popular spot for tourists 
              and Kabulis to visit on the weekend. However, Istalif&#8217;s location 
              also made it a target for military strikes during Afghanistan&#8217;s 
              25 years of war.</p>

                <td width="56%"><p>As a primarily Tajik town, at the edge of the 
                    mountains and therefore an ideal route between Kabul and the 
                    safety of the hills for resistance fighters, the Taliban saw 
                    Istalif as a threat to their rule of Kabul. As a result after 
                    weeks of fierce fighting, the Taliban took control of the 
                    town. They gave the residents a few hours warning and then 
                    slowly and methodically buried or razed every building in 
                    town.</p>
                  <p>Most of the potters in Istalif fled to Kabul, many walking 
                    for almost a month to avoid the intense fighting while carrying 
                    all their positions. Most remained in Kabul, living in poverty 
                    with relatives or in squatter villages, until the fall of 
                    the Taliban. Almost immediately after Hamid Karzai&#8217;s 
                    interim government arrived, Istalifi potters began to move 
                    slowly back to their destroyed homes and returned to what 
                    they do best, making pots.</p></td>

<p>The methods of the Istalifi potters have changed little 
                    despite the upheaval of the past three decades. They use a 
                    mixture of earthenware clays that they collect in the mountains 
                    above Istalif and bring to their workshops by donkey. To the 
                    clay they add a plant fiber called gul-e loch, which makes 
                    the clay more workable, but also makes their pots much more 
                    brittle. They do all their measuring by eye and then the clay 
                    is mixed together by stamping it with their feet for between 
                    two and four hours.</p>
                  <p>The Istalifi potters are masters on the kick wheel and traditionally 
                    make a variety of bowls and plates. They throw off a hump 
                    and often produce as many as 50 bowls an hour when they are 
                    pressed for time. Since the 1970s however, they have increasingly 
                    made candlesticks and other decorative objects, which both 
                    foreigners and visiting Kabulis purchase.</p></td>

                    The unfired pots are then dipped into a white slip containing 
                    chakhma, or ground quartz, and a white clay. The potters then 
                    use three different glazes. The most popular, sundur, is a 
                    beautiful, but also highly toxic lead glaze. By working with 
                    the Turquoise Mountain Foundation and other non-profit organizations, 
                    the potters have come to realize the danger of the lead in 
                    this glaze and are beginning to use it less. In the past, 
                    the potters used an alkaline glaze called ishkor, made from 
                    the ash of a mountain bush found north of the Hindu Kush. 
                    Mixed with copper this produces a beautiful turquoise glaze 
                    for which Istalif has long been famous. </p>

                    The potters fire in traditional updraft kilns made with house

                    seven hours, requiring over a thousand pounds of wood. The 
                    potters pack the kiln using a series of tripod stilts. This 
                    allows them to pack an incredible number of pots upside down 
                    into rather small kilns, but leaves three small scars on each

            <p><b>The Challenges</b>:</p>
            <p>While Istalifi potters have worked hard to revive their traditional 
              crafts they still face severe challenges, which the Turquoise Mountain 
              Foundation is working with them to overcome.</p>
            <p>Currently the Istalifi pots are brittle and impossible to export 
              to wider international markets. Much of this is due to the fact 
              that their wood kilns do not reach high enough temperatures and 
              are very difficult to control. The Turquoise Mountain Foundation 
              is currently working with a group of potters, teaching them how 
              to build gas kilns. These potters will then build a gas kiln at 
              TMF Resource Center, which will be available to all potters. Micro-lending 
              programs will then allow groups of potters to construct their own 
              cost-effective and more environmentally-friendly kilns. Such shared 
              kilns will allow the potters to produce less brittle pots, will 
              help slow the deforestation problem that confronts much of rural 
              Afghanistan, and make it more economically viable for the potters 
              to remove the tripod stilts.</p>
            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
              <tr valign="top"> 
                <td width="361">The Resource Center also serves as a place where 
                  visiting ceramists can come and work with the potters of Istalif. 
                  The Resource Center provides workshops for the potters that 
                  emphasize the use of safer materials and the dangers of lead-based 
                  glazes. Pottery remains a central part of the social organization 
                  of the village. Beyond their work with potters, TMF is also 
                  establishing several social programs that are run out of the 
                  Resource Center including literacy classes and workshops on 
                  business development. </td>
