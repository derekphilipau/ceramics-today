            <p> I would hardly have thought it possible to write such a comprehensive 
              book on the topic of extruding clay, but Tom and Jean Latka's publication 
              <i>&quot;<b>Ceramic Extruding, Inspiration and Technique</b>&quot;</i> 
              proves me wrong. This 140 page, full color, soft cover book deals 
              with all aspects of the topic, ranging from a history of extruding 
              to specific formulas for extruding clay bodies through to constructing 
              your own dies.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/extruding.jpg" width="126" height="172" align="left" hspace="4" alt="Book Cover Art">Extruding 
              is a technique that is well suited to clay and perhaps one that 
              is not afforded enough credit, considering the wide gamut of applications 
              it can be used for. These range from the pavement brick to the extruded 
              pitcher or the constructed, multi-part, extruded clay sculpture. 
              As the clay is extruded, it is compressed, giving it enough structural 
              strength to withstand even stoneware firings. Various formulas are 
              offered for plastic clays suitable for extruding and for different 
              firing temperatures. There is even a formula for a kiln furniture 
              clay, for those who like to make this sort of thing themselves.</p>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of extruding is die construction. 
              Dies can be purchased from commercial sources, but constructing 
              your own will enable you to make shapes not available commercially 
              and will widen the range of possible applications considerably. 
              A chapter on dies offers knowledgeable and comprehensive advice 
              on construction theory. How do dies work? How should they be constructed? 
              How does clay flow through them? Next are how-to instructions for 
              the potter. What kind of materials are suitable? How do you make 
              a solid 'coil plus' or hollow die?</p>
            <p>This is sound technical advice, but the book does not just tell 
              you how to make dies and extrude clay. It also explains in great 
              depth how to use the extruded material. Extruder projects show how 
              to make platters, bowls, weave coils, attach extruded handles, make 
              napkin rings, umbrella stands, work through tile projects and more. 
              A gallery of extruded art offers full color examples of what can 
              be done, ranging from the monumental wall piece to extruded animal 
              sculptures and woven clay baskets. Final chapters on common problems 
              and their solutions and studio safety deal with issues specific 
              to extruding clay and a final chapter shares some of the authors' 
              experiences establishing a business in making art.</p>
            <p>This is a comprehensive book on the topic of extruding clay, and 
              certainly a very useful one for the student as well as the established 
              potter, who would like to delve deeper into this ceramic technique.</p>
