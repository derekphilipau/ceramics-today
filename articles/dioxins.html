            <p> <u><B>Compounds: </B></u></p>
            <p>Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) 
              are tricyclic aromatic compounds with similar chemical and physical 
              properties. They are ubiquitous in the environment and usually do 
              not occur naturally.There are 75 positional isomers of PCDDs and 
              135 isomers of PCDFs. 2,3,7,8-TCDD (TCDD) is the most toxic isomer, 
              and the estimated toxic risk in humans is calculated in terms of 
              «TCDD equivalents». For exemple, the toxic effect of different isomers 
              is calculated in terms of the amount that would cause the same degree 
              of toxicity as TCDD. Octachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxine, produced during 
              the synthesis of pentachlorophenol (Norback et al. 1975), is quite 
              less toxic than TCDD produced during the synthesis of the herbicide 
              2,4,5-T.TCDD is one of a family of componds known effectively as 
              dioxins which comprises PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs (polychlorinated 
              biphenyls). There are 7 PCDDs, 10 PCDFs, and 12 PCBs considered 
              to give dioxin-like activity among a total of 419 congeners (compounds).</p>

            <p><B><U>Exposure:</u></B></p>
            <p>Ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption are all thought to 
              be routes of exposure to PCDDs and PCDFs. However, exposure for 
              most individuals will be small and will come through a variety of 
              sources. It is generally accepted that about 95% of human exposure 
              comes from food. The major environmental exposure hazard for humans 
              is with fish consumption. Anthropogenic production of dioxin has 
              decreased a lot during the past two decades. Current herbicide manufacturing 
              processes are designed to remove dioxin contaminants.</p>
            <p><B><U>Toxicology:</u></B></p>
            <p>Dioxins are insoluble in water but lipophilic (soluble in fats) 
              and other hydrophobic materials, and bind to solid material such 
              as soil and fly ash. They have a low rate of metabolic breakdown, 
              they preferentially accumulate in adipose tissue, skin, liver, and 
              breast milk in mammals. The amount of dioxins expressed as TCDD 
              equivalents in breast milk of lactating women often exceeds the 
              tolerated Swedish daily intake of 5 pg/kg body weight by a factor 
              of 20 to 30. In soil TCDD has an extremely long half-life time, 
              greater than 10 years. The biologic half-life in humans has been 
              measured to be in the range of 5 to 8 years. TCDD represents one 
              of the most toxic synthetic compounds known. When heated to decomposition 
              it emits toxic fumes of CL-. </p>
            <p><B><U>A - Acute intoxication:</u></B></p>
            <p>In humans, the acute toxicity of TCDD is known from accidental 
              release due to runaway reactions or explosions. <B>Essentials of 
              diagnosis are: </B>-eye and respiratory irritation, -skin 
              rash, chloracne, -fatigue,nervousness, irritability. A process accident 
              in 1949 was followed by: -acute skin, eye, and respiratory 
              tract irritation, -headache, dizzines, and nausea. These symptoms 
              subsided within 1-2 weeks and were followed by: -acneiform 
              eruption, -severe muscle pain in the extremities, thorax, and shoulders, 
              -fatigue, nervousness, and irritability, -complaints of decreased 
              libido, -intolerance to cold. Workers also exhibited: -severe 
              chloracne, -hepatic enlargement; -peripheral neuritis; -delayed 
              prothrombin time; -increased total serum lipid levels. A follow-up 
              study 30 years later found persistance of chloracne in 55% of the 
              workers. </p>
            <p><B><U>B - Chronic intoxication:</U></B></p>
            <p><B>Essentials of diagnosis are: </B>-chloracne, -soft tissue 
              sarcoma, - non-Hodgkins lymphoma, -Hodgkins disease. Chloracne 
              can result within several weeks after exposure to TCDD and can persist 
              for decades, the severity of chloracne is related to the degree 
              of exposure. In some workplaces, exposed persons had chloracne but 
              no systemic illnesses. In others, workers experienced: -fatigue, 
              -weight loss, -myalgias, -insomnia, -irritability, -decrease libido. 
              The liver has become enlarged and tender; and sensory changes particularly 
              in the lower extremities. In exposed production workers, systemic 
              symptoms, except for chloracne, have not persisted after exposures 
              ceased. The American Air Force has found a «significant and potentially 
              meaningful relationship between diabetes and bloodstream levels 
              of chemical dioxin in its ongoing study of people who worked with 
              Agent Orange.</p>
            <p> <B><U>Carcinogenesis:</u></B></p>
            <p>It acts as a complete carcinogen in several species. Rats, mice, 
              and hamsters exposed to TCDD have developed histiocytic lymphomas, 
              fibrosarcomas, and tumors of liver, skin, lung, thyroid, tongue, 
              hard palate, and nasal turbinates.Initiating or promoting carcinogenesis 
              may be functions of TCDD. It has been concluded, TCDD is among the 
              most potent identified chemical carcinogens. It is transspecies, 
              transstrain, transsex, multisite, and complete carcinogen. By now, 
              an increased risk for all cancer sites combined has been shown in 
              cohort studies on TCDD-exposed subjects, with an especially high 
              risk for soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). TCDD has also been associated 
              with Hodgkins disease and non-Hodgkins. In Seveso, Italy, area 
              with TCDD soil contamination, excess numbers of tumors have been 
              found, including lymphomas and STS. </p>
            <p><B><U>Immunotoxicity and Reproduction:</u></B></p>
            <p> Immunotoxic and reproductive effects appear to be among the most 
              sensitive indicators of dioxin toxicity. In animals TCDD is a teratogen 
              and toxic to the ftus. A variety of immunologic effects have been 
              seen in animals. Dioxin produces adverse developmental and reproductive 
              effects in fish, birds, and mammals. Laboratory studies in animals 
              suggest that dioxin-like compounds cause altered development (low 
              birth weight, spontaneous abortions, congenital malformations) adverse 
              changes in reproductive health ( fertility, sex organ development, 
              reproductive behavior). For humans, the immunotoxic effects by dioxins 
              are probably at least as serious as the carcinogenic properties. 
              Little is still understood about the potential effects on fertility 
              and the developing nervous system in children by dioxins and related 
              chlorinated compounds. TCDD may be transferred trans-placentally 
              and via breast milk, and elevated levels of TCDD have been detected 
              in adult children of female production workers exposed to dioxins. 
              Human studies have shown alteration in delayed-type hypersensitivity 
              after exposure to dioxins.</p>
            <p><B><U>Exposure limits:</u></B></p>
            <p> NIOSH recommends that TCDD be treated as a potential human carcinogen. 
              NIOSH REL (Dioxin): Reduce to lowest feasible level.</p>
            <p><U><B>Laboratory findings:</b></U></p>
            <p>1-Abnormalities reported most consistently are: -elevated 
              liver enzymes -prolonged prothrombin time -elevated cholesterol 
              and triglycerides levels 2-Urinary porphyrins may be elevated 3- 
              2,3,7,8-TCDD may be measured in: -serum (body burden) -blood 
              lipids -adipose tissue -breast milk. </p>
            <p><B><U>Differential diagnosis:</u></B></p>
            <p>Known causes of an acneiform eruption in the workplace include: 
              -petroleum cutting oils, -coal tar, -chlorinated aromatic compounds. 
              With systemic complaints, such as weight loss, headache, myalgias, 
              and irritability, other underlying medical illnesses should be ruled 
              out before attributing the disorder to TCDD. </p>
            <p><B><U>Conclusion:</u></B></p>
            <p>Not knowing the exact exposure of ceramicists to the different 
              isomers( different levels of toxicity) identified in kaolins and 
              ball clays, it is very difficult to discuss this problem properly. 
              For obvious reasons, we should be more worried about employees working 
              in mining and processing these dioxin-containing clays, and by pottery 
              factory employees than by studio potters, hobbyists, teachers and 
              their students. The use of clays made without ball clays could be 
              recommended for those more worried while awaiting more information. 
              However, in Ceramics Monthly, January 2001, page 8, Dr. David Cleverly 
              of EPA in Washington DC. is cited as having written the following 
              to a potter: </p>
            <p>The good news is that once the ball clay has been commercially 
              processed in a kiln before it is sold to potters, all the dioxin 
              is removed. We have verified this in EPAs laboratories. So you 
              can rest easy and continue making great art out of ball clay.</p>
            <p>Still, it would be good practice to proceed to good housekeeping 
              of workshops, to avoid unnecessary dusty operations and to use an 
              appropriate dust mask to prevent hazardous exposure.</p>
