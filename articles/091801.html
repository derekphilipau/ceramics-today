              ye injuries are not something we always consider when practicing 
              ceramics. They may especially occur over lengthy periods of time 
              from firing kilns. Unfortunately eye protection is something not 
              always emphasized enough in schools. I am grateful to Edouard Bastarache 
              for the use of the text below. * (Also available in <a href="091801b.html">French</a>)

            <p align="left"><font size=2><b>1-Injuries Due to Ionizing Radiation 
              :<br>
              </b></font><font size=2>X-rays, beta rays, and other radiation sources 
              in adequate doses can cause ocular injury.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>A) Lids :</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>The eyelid is particularly vulnerable to x-ray damage 
              because of the thinness of its skin. Loss of lashes and scarring 
              can lead to inversion or eversion (entropion or ectropion) of the 
              lid margins and prevent adequate closure.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>B) Conjunctiva :</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Scarring of the conjunctiva can impair the production 
              of mucus and the function of the lachrymal gland ducts, thereby 
              causing dryness of the eyes.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>C) Lens :</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>X-ray radiation in a dose of 500-800 R. directed toward 
              the lens surface can cause cataract, sometimes with a delay of several 
              months to a year before the opacities appear.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2><b>2-Injuries Due to Ultraviolet Radiation :</b></font></p>
            <p><font size=2>A) Cornea :</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 
              300 nm. (actinic rays) can damage the corneal epithelium. This is 
              most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude 
              and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from 
              bright surfaces such as snow, water, and sand. Exposure to radiation 
              generated by a welding arc can cause welding flash burn, a form 
              of keratitis.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>B) Lens :</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Wavelengths of 300-400 nm. are transmitted through 
              the cornea, and 80% are absorbed by the lens, where they can cause 
              cataractous changes. Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure 
              to solar radiation in these wavelengths near the equator is correlated 
              with a higher incidence of cataracts. They also indicate that workers 
              exposed to bright sunlight in occupations such as farming, truck 
              driving and construction work appear to have a higher incidence 
              of cataract than those who work primarily indoors. Experimental 
              studies have shown that these wavelengths cause changes in the lens 
              protein, which lead to cataract formation in animals.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2><b>3-Injuries Due to Visible Radiation (Light):</b></font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Visible light has a spectrum of 400-750 NM If the 
              wavelengths of this spectrum penetrate fully to the retina, they 
              can cause thermal, mechanical, or photic injuries.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>A) Thermal injuries:</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>They are produced by light intense enough to increase 
              the temperature in the retina by 10-20C. Lasers used in therapy 
              can cause this type of injury. The light is absorbed by the retinal 
              pigment epithelium, where its energy is converted to heat, and the 
              heat causes photocoagulation of retinal tissue.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>B )Mechanical injuries:</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>They can be produced by exposure to laser energy from 
              a Q-switched or mode-locked laser, which produces sonic shock waves 
              that disrupt retinal tissue.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>C) Photic injuries:</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>They are caused by prolonged exposure to intense light, which produces varying degrees of cellular damage in the retinal 
              macula without a significant increase in the temperature of the 
              tissue. Sun gazing is the most common cause of this type of injury, 
              but prolonged unprotected exposure to a welding arc can also damage 
              the retinal macula. There may be permanent decrease in visual acuity. 
              The intensity of light, length of exposure, and age are all important 
              factors. The older ones are more sensitive, also those who have 
              had cataract surgery because filtration of light by the lens is 
              impaired.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2><b>4-Injuries Due to Infrared Radiation:</b></font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Potters may be exposed to this type of radiation. 
              Wavelengths greater than 750 NM in the infrared spectrum can produce 
              lens changes. La "cataracte des verriers" ( glassblower's cataract 
              ) is an example of a heat injury that damages the anterior lens 
              capsule among unprotected artists. Denser cataractous changes can 
              occur in unprotected &nbsp; workers who observe glowing masses of 
              glass or iron for many hours a day.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Another important factor is the <b>distance</b> &nbsp; 
              between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of arc 
              welding, infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, 
              so that farther than 3 feet away from where welding takes place, 
              it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation 
              still does. That is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding 
              workers only have to wear clear ones.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2><b>Conclusion&nbsp;:</b></font></p>
            <p><font size=2>When we speak of type of exposure, potters look at 
              their cone packs for very short periods of time in a repeated way, 
              more often nearing the end of firing; and also according to the 
              use of other methods for measuring temperature, like the concomitant 
              use of a thermocouple and a reading device. </font><font size=2>So, 
              these &quot;&nbsp;short-term&nbsp;&quot; exposures are spaced by 
              quite longer &quot;&nbsp;exposure-free&nbsp;&quot; periods and the 
              sum of the former does not correlate with the concept of &quot;many 
              hours a day&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>We have searched the literature pertaining to Occupational 
              Health and Safety and have not found a single case of presumed &quot;&nbsp;ceramist&#8217;s 
              or potter&#8217;s cataract&nbsp;&quot;, even if the trade of potter is 
              quite older than the one of glassblower. </font><font size=2>Therefore, 
              I do not think that any of the above types of radiation present 
              a threat to potters.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>It is a good thing, mainly at high temperature, to 
              wear lightly tinted industrial grade safety glasses to better visualize 
              cones (ocular ergonomics) and also to reassure those who are more 
              worried. These glasses also offer a better protection than typical 
              sunglasses in case of projection of hot dust particles from a gas 
              kiln when looking through the peephole in a soft brick door.</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>By the way with aging, most if not all of us, will 
              suffer from cataracts of the &quot;senile&quot; type. The progress 
              or change and the related reduction in vision is usually quite slow. 
              Nuclear sclerosis-an increasing density in the central mass of protein-causes 
              a myopic change than can be corrected by changing glasses for some 
              years-in many instances restoring vision to near normal.</font></p>
