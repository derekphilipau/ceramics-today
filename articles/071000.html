              you ever had trouble with cracks developing in the base of your 
              wheel thrown work? This problem can be avoided by following a few 
              simple guidelines. </p>
            <p>Cracks develop for two main reasons: uneven drying and uneven compression 
              in the throwing process. 
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid uneven drying</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OK, so you put your wheel thrown work in a drying cupboard. You 
              even additionally cover the work with plastic sheeting, trying to 
              ensure even drying. But if you are throwing on a bat, no air reaches 
              the bottom of a platter, vessel or other thrown object. What happens? 
              The top dries a bit slower. As the top dries, it shrinks and pulls 
              together, cracking the slightly wetter and therefor less shrunk 
              surface towards the bottom. Once a crack has developed, it is near 
              to impossible to get rid of, even by turning (trimming). One way 
              to avoid this might be to turn over the work halfway in between 
              the drying process, but this is not usually feasible. So what to 
              do? How to get that bottom drying at a similar rate? The answer: 
              throw your work on plaster bats. (How to make plaster bats will 
              be the topic of a feature soon to come.) 
            <p>The bat will need to be moistened, otherwise the clay will pop 
              off too soon and throwing will become an impossibility. After throwing 
              your work, the piece can be lifted off while still on the bat, and 
              the bat, work and all, can be placed in your normal drying area. 
              After a few hours, depending on moisture content of the bat, the 
              work will pop off all by itself, and may even be ready for turning 
              that same day. 
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid uneven compression when wheel throwing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cracks may not appear until in the firing itself, often even until 
              a second high temperature firing, especially in fine clays like 
              porcelain or porcelaineous stoneware. Rougher clays like raku are 
              generally not so prone to cracking, unless you really treat them 
              badly, as the grog tends to absorb a lot of tension. For finer clays, 
              the best technique to get a consistently compressed clay throughout 
              is to center the clay on the wheelhead, then cut off the clay with 
              a cutting wire. Invert the clay and recenter 'upside down'. This 
              ensures that the clay will be quite compressed at the bottom as 
              well as at the top, thus avoiding 's-cracks'. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid uneven kiln firing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Uneven firing can also cause cracking. If one side of a pot gets 
              more heat than another, it may shrink more rapidly, causing tenion, 
              which could lead to cracks developing on cooling.</p>
            <p>Combined, these techniques should be able to cure most cracking 
              problems with wheel thrown work.</p>
