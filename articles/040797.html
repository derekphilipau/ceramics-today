<p><b>Japanese Culture seen in Kanazawa</b> </p>
<p> Welcome to Japan. The site <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/index.html"><B>Japanese 
  Culture Seen in Kanazawa</B></A> is a wonderful site for anyone with an interest 
  in Japanese culture and holds a particular interest for lovers and practitioners 
  of ceramics with its pages on Japanese ceramics and tea ceremony. 
<P> The introduction informs us of what lies ahead: "Cultural and art forms in 
  Japan are stylised and highly refined, emphasising simplicity, elegance and 
  grace; these include theatrical performances, textiles, ceramic ware and 'the 
  Way', which includes the tea ceremony. Each section offers three opportunities 
  to branch off: <B>'What is It?'</B>, <B>'The Beauty of It'</B> and <B>'Let's 
  Try It'</B>. Let's have a look at the ceramics and tea ceremony pages, as they 
  are of the greatest interest here. 
<P> Clicking on the <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/ceramic/ceramice.html"><B>Ceramics</B></A> 
  button, we are presented with a luminescent ceramics logo, which suggests the 
  fire that transforms the clay. Below we find a map of Japan, marked with the 
  most important ceramics manufacturing areas in the country. Further below, we 
  are given the invitation to a tour to the <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/ceramic/ohiyaki/ohiyakie.html"><B>Refined 
  World of Ohi</B></A>; at the time of writing the 'World of Kutani' was in preparation. 
  On the next page, we learn that <B><a href="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/ceramic/ohiyaki/what/whate.html">Ohi 
  ware</a></B> "was developed for use in the tea ceremony. Made of soft clay and 
  fired at low temperatures, Ohi pieces are prized for their beautiful shapes 
  and luster" and that they were and still are made by the Ohi Chozaemon master, 
  whose lineage dates back to 1630. 
<P> Ohi ware is made by hand without a wheel. The glaze effects are achieved by 
  taking the hot piece out of the kiln while the glaze is soft, then cooling it 
  rapidly. On the <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/ceramic/ohiyaki/what/whate.html"><B>What 
  is It?</B></A> page, one can view several beautiful pieces of Ohi work made 
  by the current master Ohi-Chozaemon Toshiro (b.1927). The <a href="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/ceramic/ohiyaki/beauty/beautye.html"> 
  <b>Beauty of It</b></a> page offers a selection of images of tea bowls, water 
  containers and ceremonial vessels by several Ohi masters. 
<P> We now go back to the homepage and click on another section of the Kanazawa 
  site, simply titled <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/waye.html"><B>The 
  Way</B></A>. "Michi (literally 'the Way') is a term used to denote the fundamental 
  principle underlying a system of though or belief, an art, or a skill...The 
  basis of Michi, the Way, resides in posture and body movement". This school 
  of thought applies to<b> </b><A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/teae.html"><B>Sado 
  (Way of Tea)</B></A>. 
<P> The <B><a href="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/what/whate.html">What 
  is It?</a></B> page gives us a short description of the basics of the Way of 
  Tea and describes the typical tea ceremony room, manners and utensils. We learn 
  that the tea ceremony may have originated as a way of settling feudal disputes 
  and one entered the ceremony room through a small entrance crawling on one's 
  knees. This is thought to instil humility in the participants or may have been 
  a way of making sure no swords were hidden under the robes. The <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/beauty/beautye.html"><B>Beauty 
  of It</B></A> bids us to 'please enjoy the beauty of the tea ceremony' and offers 
  thumbnails of tea bowls, whisks, scoops, kettles and more. Each image can be 
  enlarged if wished. 
<P>
The Kanazawa site is beautifully laid out and the images of Japanese culture are intriguing and visually stunning. This is a great site to learn something about Japanese culture and ceramics.
