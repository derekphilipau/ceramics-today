            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past several years I have enjoyed ongoing 
              e-mail conversations with my friend and potter, Shiho Kanzaki. Kanzaki 
              lives in Shigaraki, Japan. He produces pottery within the Shigaraki 
              tradition, employing the long-established methods of that tradition 
              to create and fire his works.&nbsp; As time has passed, our correspondence 
              has steadily drifted toward the themes which we hold most important 
              to our lives and art. With his permission, I share some excerpts 
              from Kanzaki’s contributions to our conversations which I have found 
              most stimulating. <BR>

              <BR>
              Before everything, I would like to review for you my basic thoughts 
              concerning the making of ceramic works and how it is that we can 
              live fully in this world. I believe that our spirits and thoughts 
              are what make our ceramics. The making of ceramics and our attitude 
              towards living are closely related. The two may seem to be unrelated 
              at a glance but I think that the relationship between the two is 
              important.&nbsp; An attitude of disarray towards living can cause 
              us to make works which have a ‘wrong spirit’ or which are without 
              soul. However, the reverse is also true: sometimes when we see certain 
              ceramic works, we get a feeling of emotion and they touch our hearts. 
              Now I believe that our response to this work is not simply because 
              of the shape, or due to excellent technique, or the beauty of the 
              surface. These ceramic works possess the spirit, soul and personal 
              history of the potter. This is why we might be so impressed with 
              these particular ceramic works. For if the beauty of a ceramic work 
              exists only in its good shape, design and colour, I suspect that 
              its effect upon us may fade over the years. But if the spirit, the 
              heart and the soul of the potter are in the pieces, these ceramic 
              works can touch our heart and soul for many years. <BR>
              The art of ceramics isn’t to be found in technique and skill alone. 
              We must extend beyond technique. And it is those who are extending 
              beyond technique who are becoming real potters: living within their 
              spirits, thoughts and religion. Because they have already discarded 
              their sense of self-will, they live in freedom. They move in a living 
              way. As a result their works have a feeling of strength, and are 
              full of life.&nbsp; It is important that we live our lives purposefully. 
              Our spirits, thoughts and hearts – all parts of us – are constantly 
              changing when we live with this sense of purpose. As we each strive 
              to live up to the best that we know as a way of life, then that 
              is when the ceramic work is the potter... the potter becomes embodied 
              in the ceramic work itself.&nbsp; Out of our moments of true being 
              come the ceramic work. <BR>
              <I>I asked Shiho Kanzaki to explain what he looks for in good work. 
              What does he think are the characteristics of the best ceramics?</I> 
              <BR>
              Ceramic works which have a tender heart, which reveal emotion and 
              life, which show a feeling of strength – these are the real ceramic 
              works.&nbsp; Such feelings come from the potter’s heart. It is quite 
              natural that these pieces are not overworked for effect. <BR>
              <IMG SRC="images/shihopi2.jpg" ALT="Shiho Kanzaki firing kiln" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 NOSAVE HEIGHT=232 WIDTH=212 ALIGN=LEFT> 
              <BR>
              If one tries to make wonderful and marvellous works in order to 
              gain the applause and approving words of others, it will be obvious. 
              Greedy and desirous potters tend to express their motivations by 
              putting excess decoration on the pot. This excess obscures the real 
              heart of the pot...&nbsp; revealing only the desires of the potter. 
              <BR>
              In order to make good work, I find that I must make an effort to 
              release myself from greed and desires. I believe that if someone 
              abandons their greed, their true spirit will come through and the 
              pots themselves will reveal a heart. For me, it is at this point 
              that the pots become real ceramic works. <BR>
              To summarise, these are the characteristics of good ceramic works: 
              they are made by potters who have moved beyond single-minded reliance 
              upon skilful technique. The work is simple and natural. The maker 
              has given up any greedy motivation. The works show us a ‘look of 
              delight’, a feeling of strength, and a full-of-life stance. And 
              these works we experience as beautiful. In fact, as I think of it, 
              I suppose that the beauty in these works is ‘continuing forever'. 
              <BR>
              <I>What sorts of ceramic works move you? Which ones touch your spirit? 
              And why do you think that some pots move you more than others?</I> 
              <BR>
              I like the natural-ash-deposit works, like those which come from 
              the Shigaraki, Iga, Bizen, Tamba and Tokoname traditions. The ancient 
              pieces from these traditions especially touch my heart. You see, 
              our ancestors were mainly farmers who, in their free time, made 
              pottery utensils for their daily needs. Their purposes were to make 
              durable and useful pots, and to make as many as possible in the 
              limited time that they had. I suppose that they didn’t give a great 
              deal of thought to the colour and shape of the pieces... to the 
              beauty of the works. But despite the likelihood that they were not 
              concerned about beauty, I find them to be beautiful with their rich 
              natural ash deposits. <BR>
              Their pots came from anagama firings. Of course, in an anagama, 
              nobody can foresee the results of the pots. The atmosphere surrounding 
              the pots determines the results. And the ash deposits grow naturally 
              from the effects of the flames. One can say that the resulting pots 
              were created by nature. And these natural-ash-deposit pots move 
              me more than others. <BR>
              <I>I asked Kanzaki how he measures success in the works he makes.</I> 
              <BR>
              There is an easy way to judge the works... whether they are successful 
              or not. The work, just after having been made, is wet and glitters 
              in much the same way that it does when it has much natural ash glaze. 
              I think that this sheen affects our response to the work... making 
              it seem bigger and better than it really is. We tend to become infatuated 
              with the ‘make-up’ on the pots... their costumes of colour, glaze, 
              shape and decorations. However to judge the work, I look at it when 
              it is dry greenware. The real beauty is to be found here in the 
              greenware. I look at the work and see it with no ‘make-up’... this 
              is the time when I measure the success of the piece. <BR>

              <BR>
              <I>How does your ceramic work change and grow over the years? Do 
              you intentionally try to make it grow, or are you responding to 
              what happens in the firing?</I> <BR>
              I have already told you how I believe our thoughts and spirits change 
              and grow as we go through life... and how our ceramic works reflect 
              those changes. However, I would like to tell you about how the firing 
              affects the work, as well. <BR>
              As you know, each firing is different because of differences in 
              weather, season, air pressure and other circumstances. I have never 
              used a pyrometer or pyrometric cones. I decided against cones and 
              pyrometer because I think that if I used them, I would tend to rely 
              upon them to make my decisions during the firings. At that point 
              my concentration would move from the firing to the tools of firing. 
              When one chooses not to use the tools, one must concentrate only 
              on the fire, the smoke colour, the sound of the kiln, and the shape 
              of the flame and smoke.&nbsp; When you accumulate these experiences 
              during the firings, you tend not to forget them. You develop an 
              understanding of a whole variety of phenomena, and then each firing 
              tells you what you need to do, and how you need to do it. Clearly, 
              gaining experience is most important for this kind of firing. <BR>
              Each firing condition is, of course, different. While I may begin 
              each firing with&nbsp; work which is similar to the work I have 
              previously made, what happens in the firing changes and adds to 
              the intentions and decisions I made while creating the pots. This 
              means that all of my works change and grow over the years in response 
              to the changing conditions of firing. </p>
