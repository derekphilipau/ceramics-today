            <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>How important is it to add to the tradition 
              as opposed to simply continuing to make work which is in line with 
              the Shigaraki tradition?</I></FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000"><img src="images/shiho_kanzaki.jpg" alt="Shiho Kanzaki" width="220" height="301" align="left">I 
              believe that the changes and maturity that occurs in our lives have 
              a direct impact on our works. In other words, our works are changing 
              day by day... as a direct result of, and as we make an effort to 
              advance our lives: to change our spirits and our souls. But there 
              is also a relationship between the long tradition of Shigaraki ceramics 
              and our daily lives. For those of us who work in the Shigaraki tradition, 
              it is one of the most important things in our lives, as potters, 
              and as human beings. You see, our ancestors were continuing to build 
              upon the traditions which they had inherited. They contributed to 
              a tradition which was long and continuous. The reason we have inherited 
              this tradition is tied to their commitment and contribution to this 
              tradition. One might ask, “Is there something new in the Shigaraki 
              tradition?” I don’t think so.</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">I suspect that there are the changes which 
              come from the changes in our daily lives. And while parts of those 
              changes are genuinely new, they are at the same time connected to 
              the existing tradition.&nbsp; I do think that I live in line with 
              the Shigaraki tradition: I live in the traditional way, and am devoted 
              to Buddha. I pray and always say:</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">Namu Ami Da Butsu (I depend upon the mind 
              of Buddha). In so doing I try to give up my desires, make my heart 
              vacant and make room for Buddha to live in me. I try to do this 
              day by day. And this commitment is important for making my work 
              and for extending the Shigaraki tradition.&nbsp; Another way of 
              thinking about this is: Who I am, is myself... changing in spirit 
              and soul, day by day.</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">I have ancestors and many good friends. I 
              was born in Shigaraki. I have my own history which, fortunately, 
              included being a mendicant and being swindled while in poverty. 
              Who I am is this: I am now, in this moment, a result of my unique 
              past: a result of how I have received and thought about the many 
              opportunities and circumstances given to me in life. My works are 
              the only things (like them) in the world at the moment that I made 
              them.</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">Yet I always make works which are in line 
              with the Shigaraki tradition and, because of my individuality, they 
              also extend the Shigaraki tradition. But what is most important 
              is what is inside our minds: the thoughts coming from our philosophy 
              and religion make our work (jobs/tasks) and our works (pottery/sculpture). 
              We are able to express our ‘fullof-life’ attitude in our pots, no 
              more than at this moment. So I can say to you that one can make 
              one’s works according to one’s abilities at the moment. Our ability, 
              therefore, is not only in technique, but our thoughts, our way of 
              living, and so on.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT> 
            <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">I asked Shiho Kanzaki who are the contemporary 
              potters whose work he admires, what it is he likes about their work 
              and why it is that their work appeals to him more than the work 
              of other contemporary potters?</FONT></I> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">I greatly respect two potters: the master 
              potters, Suketoshi Matsuyama and Hakuou Kanou. Before I built my 
              anagama kiln, I visited many potters living in the pottery centres 
              throughout Japan. I saw many of their works. There were only two 
              potters whose works touched my heart:</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">Suketoshi Matsuyama and Hakuou Kanou.</FONT> 
              <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">I first visited Suketoshi Matsuyama in 1972, 
              before I built my anagama kiln in Shigaraki. He invited me to his 
              thatched studio to show me his works. He brought out his works from 
              his store room and placed them, piece by piece, on the tatami mats. 
              At that moment, I patted myself on my knees, in spite of myself. 
              I was amazed, and the works impressed themselves on my spirit: “Here 
              it is. The work for which I have been searching, for long years.”<B> 
              </B>The works... many works, were now in front of me.<IMG SRC="images/shiho2.jpg" ALT="" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=10 HEIGHT=274 WIDTH=191 ALIGN=RIGHT></FONT> 
              <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">The shapes of all his works were simple, and 
              were reflective of his daily life. But some of the pieces had sharp 
              cut marks (which had been made with a wooden or metal tool) which 
              ran from the bottom to the top or from the top to the bottom. I 
              trembled at seeing the cut marks.&nbsp; Matsuyama said that at the 
              moment when he cut the surface of his works, he had made himself 
              a ‘samurai’ – a Japanese warrior. All his works had a rich natural 
              ash deposit. At this time, I had not been able to find any other 
              potters who were currently making this kind of natural ash deposit 
              works. I felt his tenderness and life coming through his simply-shaped 
              works. Yet his cut works were full of strength. I could see the 
              beauty of creation in non-intention in his works. I was so impressed 
              with his works that I found myself wondering whether what I was 
              seeing was real, or a dream. In the following years, I visited his 
              studio many times. He generously offered to teach me all that he 
              knew.&nbsp; And in 1974, he permitted me to call myself his apprentice.&nbsp; 
              Hakuou Kanou is a priest of the Zen (Buddhist) sect, a black-and-white 
              painter (Chinese ink painting and calligraphy) and a potter. He 
              taught me his way of making tea bowls. And he shared his basic thoughts 
              about tea ceremony. At the tea ceremony, the host puts his thoughts 
              in his guest’s position, and the guest also puts his own thoughts 
              in the host’s place – they always try to think of each others’ point 
              of view, according to a precept from (Zen) Buddhism.</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">He invited me into his tea room. He entered 
              the room with a towel over the edge of a metal washbowl in his left 
              hand, and a vacuum thermos bottle in his right hand (not the normal 
              utensils for tea ceremony).&nbsp; This way of entering the room 
              seemed strange to me. But after I had drunk much tea, I could understand 
              why he had arrived in this manner: in this circumstance, the washbowl, 
              the towel, and the thermos bottle were the right tools, because 
              he served me 13 bowls of tea.&nbsp; The utensils for tea ceremony 
              are controlled by many requirements and regulations, according to 
              each tradition (school) of tea. The first, second and third time 
              that he served me tea, the bowls were beautiful, and well within 
              the requirements of tea ceremony.&nbsp; However, as he continued 
              to serve me tea, one after the other, using different tea bowls 
              each time, my feelings began to change little by little. One bowl 
              had no foot; another had such a small foot that the pot did not 
              sit stably and almost spilled; the rim of yet another was sharp 
              like the teeth of a saw; and finally, one bowl appeared to have 
              been made to be used as an ash tray.</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">Each time he served me tea, he said only, 
              “This tea bowl is good.” And then when I began feeling a little 
              strange about his choice of tea bowls, he said, “This tea bowl is 
              better than all the others before, isn’t it?” And when he served 
              tea from the bowl with the saw teeth and from the ash tray, he said 
              “These are the best tea bowls, don’t you think?”</FONT> <BR>
              <FONT COLOR="#000000">Beyond this, he never said another word. I 
              was thinking and thinking...&nbsp; pondering what he wanted to tell 
              me by all this. He sat there in front of me during all the time 
              of my thinking, and he offered no words.&nbsp; I looked at the tea 
              bowls for long hours. I began to feel a sense of freedom from the 
              tea bowls: all of the bowls exhibited a tender heart, revealed his 
              strength of spirit and his feelings of delicate sensibilities. Finally 
              I decided to tell him my feelings. I said to him, “I gain a feeling 
              of freedom from your tea bowls. Your tea bowls are telling me that 
              one has to be free always, and to make tea bowls with the feeling 
              of freedom. One need not think about the regulations of tea bowls. 
              After all, as we know, the founder of tea ceremony selected as the 
              best bowls, pots which were being used by farmers as common utensils 
              of their daily lives.” He only gave me an affirmative nod.&nbsp; 
              Both of these two potters’ works reveal life, spirit and thoughtfulness.&nbsp; 
              And their magnificent technique is indeed superior to others’ techniques. 
              But these technical skills are behind their works. I don’t think 
              that I need to make my works new through some technique. Their works 
              have taught me this. And you may think that only new things are 
              able to extend the tradition. But I can say this: our own spirits 
              and our lives are what make our own works... and they are what extend 
              the tradition.</FONT>
