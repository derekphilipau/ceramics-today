            <p>Below you will find rough definitions for a number of words commonly 
              used in discussions of Japanese ceramics. I suggest using English 
              equivalents whenever possible. If neccessary, give the Japanese 
              term in italics with an English definition in parentheses.</p>

            <p>NOTE: Accent marks over vowels indicate long vowels. For example, 
              the &quot;&ocirc;&quot; in &quot;&ocirc;gama&quot; indicates that 
              the &quot;oh&quot; sound is two times longer than the normal &quot;oh&quot; 
              vowel. Otherwise each syllable should be given equal weight.</p>
