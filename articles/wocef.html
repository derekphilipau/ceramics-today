              at the World Ceramic Biennale, aims not only to discover newly emerging 
              artists with potential power but also to foster and support their

              have screened the entries of ceramic artists from more than 60 countries. 
              The top-notch awarding prize is one of the outstanding points that

              previous International Competitions organized by WOCEF have increasingly 
              exhibited their works in the world, proving that this International 
              Competition is becoming a springboard to recognition. </p>

              world contemporary ceramics exhibition, 'Trans-Ceramic-Art' seeks 
              to divine the future of ceramic art by presenting a new paradigm 
              of ceramic art works in which diverse genres are crossed and integrated. 
              This exhibition showcases the great potential of contemporary ceramic 
              arts and diversity of culture reflected in ceramic arts, rather 
              than presenting art in a chronological manner. </p>
            <p>This exhibition is arranged after consultation with some twenty 
              experts in ceramics including James Melchert, Emeritus Professor 
              of University of California at Berkeley; Ronald Kuchta, Editor of 
              American Ceramics; Koos de Jong, Director of the European Ceramic 
              Work Center; and Shin Sang-ho, Professor of Hongik University. Looking 
              at the hot issues of ceramics today, the realm of ceramics has expanded 
              and now engenders painting, sculpture, installation and audio/visual 
              images, expressing subjects about the identity of individuals such 
              as the human body, details of everyday life, departure from tradition, 
              ecology and consumerism, and addressing social issues entailing 
              changes in everyday routines, history, culture, and politics. </p>

            <p>This exhibition of world contemporary ceramics is separate from 
              the exhibition of the International Competition, which highlights 
              all the major trends in ceramic art generally. Unlike the International 
              Competition, Trans-Ceramic-Art is a contextual exhibition featuring 
              culture and pure art. Contemporary ceramic art has multiple meanings 
              and represents a significant step in cultural development in addition 
              to 'medium' and 'creativity,' basic elements of artwork. Focusing 
              on contextual aspects of contemporary ceramic art, Trans-Ceramic-Art 
              is arranged as an exhibit with themes and explanations. This exhibition 
              will be composed of 1) Beyond Medium, 2) Metaphor of the Body, 3) 
              Poetics of Domestic 4) History, Tradition, and Culture, and 5) Post-global 
              Society.</p>
