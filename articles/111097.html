              <b>by Ettore Sottsass</b> </font> 
            <P> The Italian designer Ettore Sottsass began working in ceramics 
              in 1956. At first not that successful with his designs for ceramics, 
              Sottsass' unique designs began to take off after a stimulating visit 
              to India in the early 1960s. 
            <P> The first ceramics after this period were called <I>Ceramics of 
              Darkness</I>. The Indian influence lingered on with the <I>Yantra</I> 
              and <I>Tantra</I> series. During this period, Sottsass developed 
              the idea of objects as diagrams, which led to his strikingly minimalist 
              and geometric ceramics. 
            <P> Sottsass, who wrote this volume himself, speaks little of the 
              actual ceramic works, but rather gives us biographical details of 
              incidents in his life which have influenced and informed his work, 
              e.g. his travels to India and his fascination with Indian mysticism. 
              Sottsass also reveals that while he designed the many ceramic vessels 
              and objects depicted in the book, he made very few of them with 
              his own hands. This step was taken over by Italian ceramics manufacturers. 
              Sottsass also reveals that he always uses commercial glazes. 
            <P> The fact that Sottsass made the designs for his works and seldom 
              executed them himself may attract the ire of some readers. Certainly 
              this method of production raises the questions: 'Who is a craftsperson?' 
              'What is a craft object?' 'Must a craft object be made by a studio 
              artist?' On the other hand, so many objects we see and use in our 
              everyday lives that we recognize as 'craft' have been made using 
              industrial techniques... 
            <P> This volume <B><I>Ettore Sottsass: Ceramics</I></B> is full of 
              great illustrations of Sottsass' work over a period of 30 years 
              and offers us an interesting insight into the life of the famous 
              Italian designer.
