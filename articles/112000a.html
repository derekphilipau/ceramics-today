              dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are tricyclic 
              aromatic compounds with similar chemical and physical properties. 
              They are ubiquitous in the environment and usually do not occur 
              naturally.There are 75 positional isomers of PCDDs and 135 isomers 
              of PCDFs. 2,3,7,8-TCDD (TCDD) is the most toxic isomer, and the 
              estimated toxic risk in humans is calculated in terms of «TCDD equivalents». 
              For exemple, the toxic effect of different isomers is calculated 
              in terms of the amount that would cause the same degree of toxicity 
              as TCDD. Octachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxine, produced during the synthesis 
              of pentachlorophenol (Norback et al. 1975), is quite less toxic 
              than TCDD produced during the synthesis of the herbicide 2,4,5-T.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>The most important sources include contaminated products such as 
              chlorinated phenols and their derivatives. Polychlorinated biphenyls 
              (PCBs); incineration of municipal, hazardous, and hospital wastes; 
              sewage sludge; automobile operations; fossil fuel combustion; and 
              emissions from fire involving PCBs are other sources. Production 
              of chlorophenols and their derivatives; chlorophenol wood treatment; 
              chlorine bleaching in the pulp industry; and production and handling 
              of iron, steel, and other metals, such as aluminium, also yields 
              dioxins.</p>
            <p>Exposure has also occurred from herbicide use and from industrial 
              and transportation incidents. In occupational settings, exposure 
              has occurred in chemical manufacturing processes and from handling 
              the wastes from these processes.&nbsp;Ingestion, inhalation, and 
              dermal absorption are all thought to be routes of exposure to PCDDs 
              and PCDFs. However, exposure for most individuals will be small 
              and will come through a variety of sources.&nbsp;It is generally 
              accepted that about 98% of human exposure comes from food.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dioxins are insoluble in water but lipophilic (soluble in fats) 
              and other hydrophobic materials, and bind to solid material such 
              as soil and fly ash. They have a low rate of metabolic breakdown, 
              they preferentially accumulate in adipose tissue, skin, liver, and 
              breast milk in mammals. The amount of dioxins expressed as TCDD 
              equivalents in breast milk of lactating women often exceeds the 
              tolerated Swedish daily intake of 5 pg/kg body weight by a factor 
              of 20 to 30.&nbsp;In soil TCDD has an extremely long half-life time, 
              greater than 10 years.The biologic half-life in humans has been 
              measured to be in the range of 5 to 8 years.TCDD represents the 
              most toxic synthetic compound known. It acts as a complete carcinogen 
              in several species.By now, an increased risk for all cancer sites 
              combined has been shown in cohort studies on TCDD-exposed subjects, 
              with an especially high risk for soft-tissue sarcoma (STS).In Seveso, 
              Italy, area with TCDD soil contamination, excess numbers of tumors 
              have been found, including lymphomas and STS. &nbsp;Among Vietnam 
              veterans, increased mortality in STS was reported.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As has been concluded, TCDD is among the most potent identified 
              chemical carcinogens.It is transspecies, transstrain, transsex, 
              multisite, and complete carcinogen.For humans, the immunotoxic effects 
              by dioxins are probably at least as serious as the carcinogenic 
              properties.&nbsp;It also causes chloracne in humans, which is the 
              most precocious clinical sign of excessive exposure to TCDD. It 
              may also cause allergic dermatitis and is an eye irritant.When heated 
              to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of CL-.&nbsp;NIOSH REL&nbsp;(Dioxin)&nbsp;: 
              Reduce to lowest feasible level.&nbsp;Little is still understood 
              about the potential effects on fertility and the developing nervous 
              system in children by dioxins and related chlorinated compounds.Also 
              of concern is the high content of dioxins in mother’s milk and in 
              the food chain (e.g. some fatty fish)&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Conclusion&nbsp;:</u></p>
            <p>Not knowing the isomers (different levels of toxicity) identified 
              in kaolins and ball clays and their concentrations, it is very difficult 
              to discuss this problem properly.&nbsp;For obvious reasons, we should 
              be more worried about employees working in mining and processing 
              these dioxin-containing clays, and by pottery factory employees 
              than by studio potters, hobbyists, teachers and their students. 
              The use of clays made without these could be recommended for those 
              more worried while awaiting more information on this subject from 
              the mining companies, even from those located on other continents.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It gives a good example why good housekeeping of your studio, avoidance 
              of unnecessary dusty operations and the use of a decent dust mask 
              are important factors. Also stay away from some fatty fish!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
