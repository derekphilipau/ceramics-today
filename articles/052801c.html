            <p> <b>Safe Kilns And Firings</b>
            <p>Many potters have expressed concerns regarding the safety aspect 
              of gas kilns and the firing procedures. This section looks at ventilation 
              and flueing requirements. Remember there are regulations that must 
              be adhered to and you should always check with your local authorities 
              prior to any installation. 
            <p> <i>Ventilation</i><br>
              Potentially the most dangerous aspect of firing a gas kiln is insufficient 
              fresh air and inadequate exhausting of combustion products. 
            <p> <b>Never locate kilns inside sealed rooms or where access to sufficient 
              fresh, outside air is not available.</b> 
            <p> Gas burners require large volumes of oxygen to complete combustion. 
              Typically a natural gas burner requires for every 1 cubic meter 
              (cubic foot) of gas burned, 10 cubic meters (cubic feet) of fresh 
              air. L.P. Gas burners require 2.5 times the air volume. Fresh air 
              for the kiln should be available using fixed venting at a low level 
              in the door or wall or through a powered fan. The vent size is sized 
              by determining the MJ/Hour total burner rating. If the air is drawn 
              from outside, the rate in our area is 160mm2 per MJ/Hour, therefore 
              a typical gas kiln with 2 burners with an input of 400MJ/Hour would 
              require fixed ventilation of at least 250 x 256 mm. If the kiln 
              is drawing air from an adjacent room the area should be doubled. 
              Incidentally the maximum hole size if mesh is used is 6mm square.<br>
              Note: This is for natural gas burners only, <b>L.P. Gas burners 
              require 2.5 times the area.</b> 
            <p> <i>Flueing</i><br>
              <b>Please note: All gasfitting or flueing work should be undertaken 
              by a licensed gasfitter.</b> 
            <p> The products of combustion can contain hazardous gasses and should 
              be safely exhausted to atmosphere. A natural gas burner using 1 
              cubic meter of gas will produce 1 cubic meter of carbon dioxide, 
              2 cubic meters of water vapor and 8 cubic meters of nitrogen. If 
              the fresh oxygen supply is restricted and the combustion process 
              is incomplete carbon monoxide will result. This is a lethal gas 
              even in small quantities. Of course, this is a common occurrence 
              in reduction firings and the need to be absolutely sure the gasses 
              are safely removed from the work area is vital. 
            <p> The chimney (or flue) should be of the correct construction. It 
              is possible to construct a brick chimney but is usually more economical 
              to use a metal type with the large variety of connections and accessories 
              available. A draft terminal can be fitted on top of an existing 
              brick flue with the right adapter. A metal flue will also reach 
              operating temperature, or a temperature to create sufficient draw, 
              quicker than a brick chimney. Generally it is more economical over 
              the longer term to specify a stainless steel flue. It is not necessary 
              with gas kilns fitted with venturi burners to have a chimney that 
              is excessively long. This used to be essential with oil burners 
              or gas burners that relied on large volumes of primary air (air 
              required around the burner tip to complete combustion) for combustion 
              as the chimney height determined the draw available. Flues on modern 
              downdraft gas kilns are generally terminated near the top of the 
              kiln, a canopy is fitted over this, a pipe is continued through 
              the roof and an approved terminal is connected to the outlet. The 
              canopy is necessary for two main reasons: 
            <p> The canopy will slow down the draw from the kiln. Too much draw 
              will make the kiln inefficient through pulling the heat through 
              the stack before it has completed its task and can contribute to 
              uneven temperatures. The air the canopy pulls in helps to dilute 
              the flue gasses, cooling them to ensure the chimney lasts longer 
              and saving our environment. 
            <p> It is important the canopy is larger in area than the outlet from 
              the kiln. This ensures that there is no spillage of gasses. The 
              canopy should also be a certain shape so that there are not sharp 
              edges or steps to cause turbulence. This can induce spillage and 
              effect the passage of gasses. It is a good idea to buy a ready made 
              unit from companies that have experience in gas flueing. If the 
              pipe is passing through a roof it is necessary to have a minimum 
              clearance from any combustible material of 600mm however this can 
              be reduced if the material is protected with insulation. An approved 
              flue cowl should be fitted to the end of the stack. This will help 
              to ensure the wind does not affect the firing, birds stay out of 
              the chimney and there is not excessive draw from the flue.
