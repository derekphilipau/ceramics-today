<H3>Raku Update</H3>

<IMG align=left SRC="../images/h_gills.gif" alt="H">elp! Raku is taking over the Net! Well...not quite, but there sure is a lot of online raku art. This is all the more of an enigma, considering that you can't get much more low tech than raku! (Unless you'd like to consider <A HREF="090197.html"><B>pit-firing</B></A>).
<P>
Building on the previous Ceramics Today feature on <A HREF="041497.html"><B>Raku</B></A>, here's an update of new raku pages on the Web.
<P> <A HREF="http://www.clayarts.com/"><B>Robert E. Carlsons </B></A>site is professionally 
  crafted and features his excellent raku vessels, basket forms and other objects. 
  <A HREF="http://yarra.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/sal2.html"><B>Salvatori Lolicatos</B></A>
  new work consists of raku fired body casts, including torsos and heads, a departure 
  from his <A HREF="http://yarra.vicnet.net.au/~claynet/salamnda.html"><B>earlier
  work</B></A>, which was of a more 'interactive' and erotic nature. <!--<A HREF="http://www.sp.net.nz/dave.html"><B>David Warrens Raku Artefacts</B></A> are fired several times, building up surface color, texture and depth. They consist of wall plaques, murals, panels and sculpture. -->
<P> <A HREF="http://www2.ebicom.net/~bmyrick/"><B>Byron Myricks Wonderful World 
  of Raku</B></A> consists of his 'Three Legged Quilted Pots'. These also make 
  use of geometric patterns, but in quite a different way. His site also features 
  other raku work, such as the 'Teapot Effigy' series.
<P>
The thousands of years old tradition of raku seems a contrast to our high-tech age of space exploration and information technology, but perhaps just because of its down-to-earth, low-tech features, it's here to stay.
