            <p> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T" border=0>here 
              is something enigmatic about the 'Watercolors on Porcelain' technique. 
              The elusive colors, that may or may not be as expected; the transmutation 
              in the fire -to get that most precious, beautiful surface. The parallels 
              with alchemy of the Middle Ages certainly are there: European porcelain 
              was 'discovered' by the German Alchemist Johann Friedrich Boettger 
              around 1709, after numerous vain attempts to copy Chinese Porcelain 
              in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. There is the use of precious 
              metals -gold, silver, rhodium, palladium; the transformation in 
              the high temperature firing; the knowledge of the underlying chemical 
              processes; the chance discoveries... While it is not gold that we 
              are trying to discover (although precious metals including gold 
              may be used), the 'Watercolors on Porcelain' technique is still 
              used by relatively few. This has its reasons -some of the raw materials 
              are prohibitively expensive, they are highly toxic and necessitate 
              extreme care, the results are not always promising and more research 
              needs to be undertaken, despite knowledge already pioneered by others.

              Just what is WOP? (I shall use this acronym from now on). As most 
              readers will know, the majority of traditional ceramic colors come 
              in the form of oxides or carbonates that are used in underglazes, 
              onglazes and as slip and glaze additives. From these oxides and 
              carbonates come the broad palette of decorative effects that we 
              have known for centuries, even millennia. In the late 1980's, Professor 
              Arne &#197;se investigated the use of watersoluble metal salts, 
              derivatives of the oxides and carbonates, for color effects and 
              possible applications in studio ceramics. He chose to test these 
              substances on porcelain, as the whiteness of this particular clay 
              should give the most untainted color response. Thus the WOP technique 
              was born. 
            <P> Which chemicals are we actually talking about? As already mentioned, 
              they are watersoluble metal salts: chlorides, sulphates and nitrates 
              of some common and other not so common metals, eg. Gold Chloride, 
              Nickel Sulphate or Iron Nitrate. In most cases there will be a chloride, 
              nitrate and sulphate version of a given metal available, eg. Copper 
              Chloride, Copper Nitrate and Copper Sulphate. There are also some 
              useful colorants that aren't actually metallic salts, but nonetheless 
              watersoluble, eg. Potassium Dichromate. Being watersoluble, these 
              chemicals will react in a different way when applied to a clay surface. 
              Instead of sitting on the surface they will stain and penetrate 
              the clay, sometimes going right through to the other side, so some 
              unexpected results can be reckoned with! 
            <P><IMG align=right SRC="../images/wop.jpg" alt="Porcelain Bowl" border=0 HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5"> 
              While a fair amount of research has been done with the chlorides 
              and nitrates, I think the sulphates have been overlooked somewhat. 
              The fact that Iron Sulphate, Cobalt Sulphate and Copper Sulphate 
              were readily available and relatively inexpensive led me to investigate 
              these chemicals. I'd also like to talk about Gold Chloride, Potassium 
              Dichromate and to a degree Uranyl Nitrate, plus the effects of resist 
              materials and the use of Phosphoric Acid. These materials can sometimes 
              be bought from potters suppliers, some will need to obtained from 
              a supplier to laboratories. For our purpose, the grade or purity 
              need not be high. Generally they will be supplied in a powder or 
              crystalline form from which a solution must be made. When dealing 
              with these chemicals it is advisable to wear thick rubber gloves, 
              a mask with gas attachments and also goggles to protect the eyes. 
              Eating or drinking anywhere near these chemicals is of course out 
              of the question (and something one shouldn't do near ceramic materials 
              anyway). A few other things will be necessary: some glass jars that 
              will not leak (food jars aren't good enough!); a chemists measuring 
              tumbler, with measurements from 1 to 50 ml; an accurate set of scales, 
              with 1 gm gradations. All decoration is carried out on bisqued ware 
              and then fired to approximately 1270 degrees celsius in a reduction 
              atmosphere. 
            <P> <B>Cobalt Sulphate</B> 
            <P> A useful concentration for Cobalt Sulphate is about 10%. To make 
              this, we weigh 10 gms of Cobalt Sulphate powder and add it to 100 
              ml of water. I have previously used distilled water, but this isn't 
              really necessary unless your tap water is really impure. Carefully 
              add the powder to the water without spilling any. This should be 
              done wearing a good mask with gas filter and good rubber gloves 
              that are impervious to water and definitely not inside any living 
              quarters. Brushes must be washed well in running water and not used 
              for any other purpose. Always ensure there are a few layers of newspaper 
              underneath the work to avoid soiling the working area. If anything 
              is ever spilt, clean it up immediately and thoroughly. Never reuse 
              cleaning utensils such as sponges. 
            <P> The solution is now ready to be applied. This can be done with 
              a brush, freehand or on the wheel. Protect any bench surfaces or 
              wheel heads with newspaper. Just how many layers of solution should 
              be brushed on is a matter of finding out what works for you, as 
              the result also depends on the type of brush you are using and on 
              the density of the clay. Spraying is not recommended as it can be 
              messy, even with a spraying booth. One of the greatest difficulties 
              in applying these chemicals is the fact that they are very hard 
              to see once painted on. One way to get around this would be to add 
              ink or food colorants to the liquids. 
            <P> After applying the Cobalt Sulphate, I sometimes apply a layer 
              of Uranyl Nitrate over the top, also with a brush, in a concentration 
              of 7.5%. The greatest care needs to be taken with this chemical, 
              it is highly toxic! After a short drying time, Phosphoric Acid (85% 
              concentration) can be applied to achieve the 'halo' effect. Of course 
              great care also needs to be taken when handling the acid - goggles 
              should be worn! The effect of the Phosphoric Acid is to displace 
              the colors and concentrate them on the edge. This will often reveal 
              the white color of the underlying porcelain.
