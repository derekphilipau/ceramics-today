      <p><font size="4"><b>A Ceramic Safari in East Africa</b></font><br>
      <p><img src="../images/safari3.jpg" width="325" height="219" align="left" hspace="3">I 
        enrolled at The New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University. 
        Among the more important projects I undertook there was to build a scove 
        kiln with the help of a small group of people who formed Volunteers in 
        Technical Assistance (VITA). This scove kiln is built of the same bricks 
        that it is firing. (Scoving is the mud on the outside of the kiln.) These 
        simple kilns are built all over Africa with the biggest investment being 
        time and labour. First, clay is dug and formed into bricks. These are 
        dried and stacked en masse, a finger's width apart. A slow wood fire is 
        started underneath and in due course (days later) the kiln is dismantled, 
        the bricks ready to use. But our brick and kiln at Alfred differed from 
        those in Africa in one important respect: We had mixed creek sand by foot 
        into our red clay to make it refractory. We had taken a first journey 
        into an uncharted region of appropriate technology with little prior information 
        as to methodology. Our premise for the scove kiln project was that we 
        were making simple refractory brick and that villagers almost anywhere 
        in the developing world could do the same. Without much financial outlay, 
        villagers could then build ware kilns with the bricks for the production 
        of a variety of ceramic building materials, other refractories, table 
        and sanitary ware. In a second phase, a foundry could make carpentry or 
        farm tools, curtailing costly procurement of imported implements. For 
        water and sanitation, they could make ceramic water filters, pipes and 
        tiles for drainage or simple sanitary wares. For agriculture, kilns can 
        be built to burn lime. Glazed food storage containers would help preserve 
        food until it reaches the market. With all these various sectors in need 
        of simple, inexpensive solutions on a village level, clear opportunities 
        in appropriate, small business developments are wide open. So the journey 
        leads to an inevitable conclusion: The only true guarantee of self-sustainability 
        is, I believe, to be found in ceramics, the starting point of nearly all 
        industry. Training and education in ceramics and in high temperature processes 
        are the prerequisite to start. It is the manufacturers' products, like 
        refractory bricks or carpenters' tools, that make so much industry possible. 
        A consumer product, like a vegetable or an article of clothing, plays 
        no further role in developing industry. </p>
      <p><i>Top: Atop the Hoffman brick kiln at Khorobhagarat, Sudan. Egyptian 
        technicians at left and center talk to their Sudanese counterparts. The 
        kiln's heat helps the heavy fuel oil in the containers to become less 
        viscous.</i> </p>
      <p>Sudan's number one export is cotton. It also grows sunflowers for producing 
        oil. The stalks of both cotton and sunflowers usually go to waste. Bagasse 
        is a byproduct of sugar cane, mixed with molasses. South of Khartoum, 
        a carbonized bagasse is being manufactured. Another important attribute 
        of the vertical tunnel kiln is that it is well suited to small scale production, 
        requiring only three or four workers at any time to operate. Along with 
        its obvious environmental advantages, this kiln complies with the need 
        to start industry on the smallest scale. For the BRRI's kiln, a second 
        educational phase would aim to improve the skills of traditional brick 
        makers, training and encouraging them to build their own vertical tunnel 
        kilns.</p>
      <p> <img src="../images/safari7.jpg" width="300" height="170" align="left" hspace="4"><i>Left: 
        Stalls for foot-mixing brick materials will soon be replaced by a mechanised 
        mixer. This will help make possible the drier mix needed for uniform bricks 
        and proper stacking, resulting in better bricks and reduced fuel consumption.</i> 
      <p> The people of developing countries are industrious and resourceful, 
        using constructively what many from the richer countries would regard 
        as waste: tyres turned into sandals, discarded coffee cans turned into 
        lanterns, a scrap of paper turned into a bag.
