                <br>
                II. Fire Fighting Measures:</p>
              <p>A. Fire: <br>
                Not combustible, but substance is a strong oxidizer and its heat 
                of reaction with reducing agents or combustibles may cause ignition. 
                Releases oxygen, upon decomposition, which enhances combustion. 
                <br>
                B. Explosion: <br>
                Contact with oxidizable substances may cause extremely violent 
                combustion. <br>
                C. Fire extinguishing media: <br>
                Flood with large amounts of water. Water spray may be used to 
                keep fire exposed containers cool. Do not allow water runoff to 
                enter sewers or waterways.<br>
                D. Special information: <br>
                In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved 
                self-contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece operated 
                in the pressure demand or other positive pressure mode. </p>
              <p>PREVENTION:</p>
              <p>I. Stability and Reactivity:</p>
              <p>A. Stability: <br>
                Stable under ordinary conditions of use and storage. <br>
                B. Hazardous decomposition products: <br>
                Burning may produce chrome oxides. <br>
                C. Hazardous polymerization: <br>
                Will not occur. <br>
                D. Incompatibilities: <br>
                Reducing agents, acetone plus sulfuric acid, boron plus silicon, 
                ethylene glycol, iron, hydrazine, and hydroxylamine. Any combustible, 
                organic or other readily oxidizable material (paper, wood, sulfur, 
                aluminum or plastics). <br>
                E. Conditions to avoid: <br>
                Heat, incompatibles. </p>
              <p>II. Handling and Storage:</p>
              <p>Protect against physical damage. Store in a dry location separate 
                from combustible, organic or other readily oxidizable materials. 
                Avoid storage on wood floors. Remove and dispose of any spilled 
                dichromates; do not return to original containers. Wear special 
                protective equipment for maintenance break-in or where exposures 
                may exceed established exposure levels. Wash hands, face, forearms 
                and neck when exiting restricted areas. Shower, dispose of outer 
                clothing, change to clean garments at the end of the day. Avoid 
                cross-contamination of street clothes. Wash hands before eating 
                and do not eat, drink, or smoke in workplace. Containers of this 
                material may be hazardous when empty since they retain product 
                residues (dust, solids); observe all warnings and precautions 
                listed for the product. </p>
              <p>III. Accidental Release Measures:<br>
                Ventilate area of leak or spill. Wear appropriate personal protective 
                equipment.<br>
                Spills: Sweep up and containerize for reclamation or disposal. 
                Vacuuming or wet sweeping may be used to avoid dust dispersal. 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                IV. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection:</p>
              <p>A. Ventilation System: <br>
                A system of local and/or general exhaust is recommended to keep 
                employee exposures below the Airborne Exposure Limits. Local exhaust 
                ventilation is generally preferred because it can control the 
                emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion 
                of it into the general work area. <br>
                If the exposure limit is exceeded and engineering controls are 
                not feasible, a half facepiece particulate respirator (NIOSH type 
                N95 or better filters) may be worn for up to ten times the exposure 
                limit or the maximum use concentration specified by the appropriate 
                regulatory agency or respirator supplier, whichever is lowest. 
                A full-face piece particulate respirator (NIOSH type N100 filters) 
                may be worn up to 50 times the exposure limit, or the maximum 
                use concentration specified by the appropriate regulatory agency, 
                or respirator supplier, whichever is lowest. <br>
                If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, 
                etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. <br>
                For emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are not 
                known, use a full-facepiece positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator. 
                <br>
                WARNING: Air-purifying respirators do not protect workers in oxygen-deficient 
                atmospheres. <br>
                B. Skin Protection: <br>
                Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, 
                lab coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin 
                contact. <br>
                C. Eye Protection: <br>
                Use chemical safety goggles and/or full face shield where dusting 
                or splashing of solutions is possible. Maintain eye wash fountain 
                and quick-drench facilities in work area. </p>
              <p>V. Disposal Considerations:<br>
                Whatever cannot be saved for recovery or recycling should be handled 
                as hazardous waste and sent to an approved waste facility. Processing, 
                use or contamination of this product may change the waste management 
                options. State and local disposal regulations may differ from 
                federal disposal regulations. Dispose of container and unused 
                contents in accordance with federal, state and local requirements. 
              </p>

              <p>A. Inhalation:<br>
                Corrosive. Extremely destructive to tissues of the mucous membranes 
                and upper respiratory tract. Symptoms may include:<br>
                - sore throat <br>
                - coughing <br>
                - shortness of breath <br>
                - and labored breathing <br>
                Higher exposures may cause pulmonary edema. <br>
                B. Ingestion: <br>
                Corrosive. Swallowing can cause severe burns of the mouth, throat, 
                and stomach, leading to death. Can cause sore throat, vomiting, 
                diarrhea. May cause violent gastroenteritis, peripheral vascular 
                collapse, dizziness, intense thirst, muscle cramps, shock, coma, 
                abnormal bleeding, fever, liver damage and acute renal failure. 
                <br>
                C. Skin Contact: <br>
                Corrosive. Symptoms of redness, pain, and severe burn can occur. 
                Dusts and strong solutions may cause severe irritation. Contact 
                with broken skin may cause ulcers (chrome sores) and absorption, 
                which may cause systemic poisoning, affecting kidney and liver 
                functions. May cause skin sensitization. May be absorbed through 
                the skin; symptoms may parallel ingestion. <br>
                D. Eye Contact: <br>
                Corrosive. Contact can cause blurred vision, redness, pain and 
                severe tissue burns. May cause corneal injury or blindness.<br>
                <br>
                III. Chronic Effects: <br>
                Repeated or prolonged exposure can cause ulceration and perforation 
                of the nasal septum, respiratory irritation, liver and kidney 
                damage and ulceration of the skin. Ulcerations at first may be 
                painless, but may penetrate to the bone producing &quot;chrome 
                holes.&quot; <br>
                <br>
                IV. Aggravation of Pre-existing Conditions: <br>
                Persons with pre-existing skin disorders, asthma, allergies or 
                known sensitization to chromic acid or chromates may be more susceptible 
                to the effects of this material. </p>
              <p>V. Pregnancy:</p>
