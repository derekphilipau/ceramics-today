              Vitreous Vicissitudes, by Georgette Ore (Chapter 4 in the 'Rascal 
              Ware' series)</b></p>
            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
              <tr> 
                <td width="29%" valign="top"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore13.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/ore13_sm.jpg" alt="Rascal Ware by Georgette Ore" width="213" height="252" border="0" align="left"></a></td>
                <td width="71%" valign="top"> <p>Vitreous vicissitudes sounds 
                    like an oxymoron but it isn&#8217;t. Last week we heard that 
                    some of my Rascal Ware was actually accepted for exhibition. 
                    I was 0 for 11 up till then and the air in the studio was 
                    getting a little tight. As a bonus, the judge (who is now 
                    referred to around here as St. Virginia) saw fit to anoint 
                    these pieces with an award. This all sparked a lunchtime discussion 
                    about judges, quality, who might be blind to it and other 
                    touchy subjects. People were naming names and the conversation 
                    coarsened very quickly. Blind justice is one thing. Blind 
                    judges are another. </p>
                  <p>The upside of this brawl was that the new guy, Hairy Potter, 
                    crossed a line and Junior fired his ass. The truth is that 
                    Hairy&#8217;s first day on the job was his best and it was 
                    downhill after that. He looked like an opportunity but turned 
                    out to be just an opportunist; common enough in the art game.</p>
                  <p>The downside was that Pilcher tried to restore order and 
                    elevate the discourse by posing questions nobody could (or 
                    wanted to) answer. He can turn small talk into a seminar in 
                    a heartbeat. That stuff flew at the U but we professionals 
                    weren&#8217;t having any of it. </p></td>

                <td valign="top"><a href="images/rascal_ware/ore14.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/ore14_sm.jpg" alt="Rascal Ware by Georgette Ore" width="213" height="252" border="0" align="left"></a></td>
                <td valign="top"> <p>Anyhow, back to judges and quality and all 
                    that. The problem begins at the beginning and it hangs on 
                    this notion: Some pots are better than others and if you work 
                    hard, you can learn to make the better ones. So your teacher 
                    says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how it&#8217;s done.&#8221; 
                    The line that usually doesn&#8217;t follow is this one; &#8220;By 
                    the way, while I know these are really good pots, they are 
                    frequently rejected by others&#8230;currently at a rate of 
                    11 to 1. Take advanced ceramics and I&#8217;ll tell you why 
                    that is.&#8221;</p>
                  <p>In advanced ceramics you learn that the disconnect between 
                    the maker and the viewer or judge- is not a scandal, it&#8217;s 
                    a mystery. For example, don&#8217;t we all see work published 
                    in magazines all the time that is nothing special? Maybe even 
                    on this very page. Well somebody likes it&#8230;a lot. The 
                    explanation comes from our resident philosopher, Mosley Bunkham. 
                    He embraces this disconnect as follows: &#8220;Art is a business 
                    with no bottom, which is not to say that all of it is equal. 
                    It&#8217;s just that where you stand on better and worse depends 
                    entirely on where you sit.&#8221; </p>
                  <p>At Rascal Ware here&#8217;s where we sit. Find an empty chair. 
                    Keep an open mind. Stay as long as it takes. It&#8217;s OK 
                    to let them see you sweat. Think faster, work slower and let 
                    the kilns cool even slower than that. Keep good records. Answer 
                    your mail. Don&#8217;t become a slave to your cell phone. 
                    Try not to make the same thing over and over. Keep coming 
                    back and, as I said last time, go easy on the pork buffet.</p></td>
