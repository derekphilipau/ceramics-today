              aperclay is an increasingly popular medium with artists, craftspeople, 
              hobbyists and teachers. It offers all the properties of a favourite 
              clay body as well as the opportunity to use techniques borrowed 
              from woodwork, bricklaying, candle making and metalwork. While paperclay 
              has been around for decades as a way to create non-warp clay slabs, 
              it has recently become popular as a ceramic art material because 
              of its dry building properties and pre-firing strength. Introduced 
              to paperclay by Jaromir (Mike) Kusnik, a ceramic technologist who 
              had been experimenting with it since the early 1980s, I have been 
              exhibiting and teaching paperclay techniques since 1992. 
            <p></p>
            <p> <img src="../images/hay2.jpg" width="166" height="253" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Paperclay Sculpture by Grham Hay">As 
              indicated previously by Caplan, Ellery, Gartside and Gault (see 
              references), any clay can be made into a paperclay by mixing a smooth 
              puree of water and paper fibre into the clay body while in slip 
              form. While some artists prefer to use cotton-based paper, the local 
              non-gloss newspaper is both satisfactory and inexpensive. I roll 
              it up and push it through the branch port of an electric garden 
              mulcher before covering the paper flakes with about ten times their 
              loose volume in hot water. A free-standing slip mixer is used to 
              puree it until all individual pieces of paper disappear. A flyscreen 
              or plastic shade cloth is used as a sieve to remove most, but not 
              all, of the water. As a guide, I remove just enough water so that 
              the puree does not slide through my fingers. I mix a third of a 
              bucket of puree with two thirds of a bucket of clay slip, by volume. 
              I have not needed to use this technique for some time, however, 
              because a local clay manufacturer has been producing and selling 
              earthenware and stoneware paperclay at conventional clay prices 
              for the past year. 
            <p> Slipcasting properties are retained and, provided the paper fibre 
              is sufficiently fragmented into individual fibres, the clay can 
              be used on the potter's wheel. However, extruding fine rods is not 
              possible because the paper fibre disrupts the process. The resulting 
              fibrous clay can be joined conventionally &#8211; plastic-to-plastic, 
              as well as radically &#8211; plastic-to-dry, or dry-to-dry. While the 
              latter techniques are relatively simple processes, they do involve 
              some unlearning of entrenched habits. The easiest way to grasp the 
              real advantages of paperclay is to make long rods or strips, allow 
              them to completely dry before joining using paperclay slops or slip 
              as the joining 'glue'.
