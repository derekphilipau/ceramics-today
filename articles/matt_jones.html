              The Life and Art of Eva Zeisel.<br>
              Canobie Films. Directed by Jyll Johnstone.<br>
              60 mins.<BR>
            
            <P> Eva Zeisel is a name many may not have heard, an artist and designer 
              many may not be aware of. Despite this, many may have seen her designs, 
              may have been touched by her work. Many will certainly be touched 
              by this lovingly and thoughfully directed documentary on the Hungarian-German-American 
              ceramist.</P>
            <p>Zeisel's extroadinary story is shown through her own eyes and those 
              of her contemporaries - interviews with the artist, family, friends, 
              collegues, gallerists and curators are put into context with the 
              help of narchival footage from the turbulant era that Zeisel was 
              a part of.</p>
            <p>Zeisel was born in Budapest in 1906. Her mother, we are told, was 
              a pioneer feminist activist. Zeisel studied art, then decided that 
              if she actually wanted to sustain herself, learning a practical 
              craft would be more sensible, so she learnt the trade at a porcelain 
              factory. The industrial approach was one that became a golden thread 
              through Zeisel's life works, but her personality gave them a distinct 
              human touch. &quot;If it gives pleasure to the eye, it is beauty&quot; 
              she says.</p>
            <p>In 1930, she went to Berlin, somehow manging to start a personal 
              trend, whereby she would always be at the forefront of political 
              developments, although by no means to her advantage. There she worked 
              at another porcelain factory, with a designer seconded to her. In 
              1932 she went to the Soviet Union, drawn there not by political 
              developments, but by the lure of an exotic culture. There she soon 
              found favor, gaining a position as artistic director of an important 
              glass and ceramics factory. However favor did not last and in 1936 
              Zeisel was arrested by the KGB for allegedly planning to assassinate 
              Stalin. she was imprisoned in St. petersburg for 16 months, then 
              inexplicably deported to Austria. How she survived that episode 
              is still a mystery to her today. In Austria she met up with an earlier 
              admirer Hans, and soon got married.</p>
            <p>Events, however, were not to leave Zeisel in peace. In 1938 Hitler 
              Germany annexed Austria and Zeisel, probably again fearing for her 
              life, emigrated to the USA, which was to become her new home. Penniless, 
              Zeisel soon got an order for 10 miniature pieces, earning her $100. 
              &quot;We were never poor. People like us were never poor&quot;, 
              she says a bit self-mockingly. &quot;We just had no money&quot;.</p>
            <p>Soon Zeisel was at the forefront of design, making a set described 
              as 'very Greenwich Village', i.e. modern. At the time, her work 
              was very 'hard edge', but over the years her forms became softer. 
              She was to go on to make some of the most famous China sets to come 
              out of the USA - 'Hallcraft' and 'Tomorrow's Classic', one of America's 
              best ever selling sets. It was very refined, even aristocratic, 
              but inexpensive. Zeisels' work since that period has been characterized 
              by curves and wavy lines.</p>
            <p>While all this was going on, Zeisel also managed to raise five 
              children. Her husband Hans was a law professor in Chicago, where 
              she spent more and more time from the mid 1970s. While juggling 
              family life with pottery, this amazing women also taught at the 
              Pratt &amp; Rhode island School of Design. She now again lives in 
              NYC and, driven by a desire for 'playfullness', still designs at 
              the age of 98. &quot;The others&quot; she says &quot;were always 
              the 'grown ups'. I somehow got old without ever growing up&quot;.</p>
            <p>Produced by Canobie Films, Throwing Curves is the first of a documentary 
              film series that explores the lives of 85-plus women still actively 
              engaged in their creative lives.</p>
