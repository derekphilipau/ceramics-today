              ceramic vessels emerge from the potter&#8217;s wheel. Yet the romanticized 
              and artistic aspects of this traditional working technique are far 
              from what he actually does. He is concerned with the problem of 
              modern vessel-ceramics in general: the search for developing and 
              forming of vessels beyond their apparent use or purpose. As an astute 
              beneficiary of studying centuries-old ceramics development, he has 
              thorough mastery of the craft. He sees his medium from basic vessels 
              through radical transformations, which ultimately need no instructions 
              or words. &quot;They are vessels without speculative ingratiation,&#8221; 
              an auspiciously polemical articulation by Volker Ellwangers, who 
              once described the work of his teacher Jan Botjes von Beek with 
              similar praise. That comment exemplified not only to Volker&#8217;s 
              own work, but also &#8220;A fortifiori,&#8221; which was crafted 
              by Martin Schlotz.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1033.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1033.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1293.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1293.jpg" width="151" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1043.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1043.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>Martin Schlotz works in thematic series. He works on variations 
              of one specific type of form at a time. He might create smooth, 
              strong tower forms made of stoneware clay on a wide base, built 
              up in tightly structured arrangements. He may conjure austere-walled 
              shells of a clear tectonic structure, stemming from a narrow enlarged 
              foot to a high, wide-rimmed opening. His ideal point of departure 
              is often the basic cylinder, which can be fashioned into slimmer 
              or wider conic forms. Never are these forms gently rounded through 
              incremental modular combinations. Martin is truly composing art, 
              not an assembly-line combination of individual pieces. Contrary 
              to standard expectations, there are no construction plans involved. 
              The quite unrefined and sometimes technical severity of the autonomous 
              form is hiding the relaxed, joyful candidness of its development; 
              decisions are only made through aesthetic judgment. The angle of 
              the aperture, the sharpness of a wrapping, the height of a section, 
              the proportions of parts to one another, are wholly arrived through 
              inspired intuition. Ultimately, this intuition, like the artist, 
              may love or loath the finished work, yet would not know either throughout 
              the process until the work is complete. The variations themselves 
              confirm the ambiguity of art: though a piece is seemingly perfect, 
              the perfect piece will never exist to the true artist who continuously 
              strives toward perfection &#8211; the unattainable goal. Such is 
              true with Martin Schlotz.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1486.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1486.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1297.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1297.jpg" width="150" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1495.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1495.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>The entire process illustrates the artist&#8217;s passion and skill. 
              The created forms will be covered with adequate glaze, though rarely 
              completely. Square-dipping of the vessel often leads to an open 
              base. By covering the different variations with similar glaze, the 
              effect of hiding and purifying the form is visible: less may be 
              more, very little everything. Martin Schlotz uses different glazes 
              with confident mastery. Years of experience provides him with an 
              immense on-demand knowledge base concerning the handling of the 
              material. This wide spectrum of techniques leads to unpredictable 
              behavior during the reduction firing, though often with magnificent 
              results. The glaze, featuring at times the crackle pattern or the 
              oxidized and fire-licked surface treatment, never becomes an effect 
              or an end in itself: opaque or transparent, matte or glossy, thick 
              or thin-layered, engobe-undercoated or colored, the glaze always 
              serves the form. The relational effect between form and glaze is 
              also unpredictable. Decisions during the process of glazing are 
              made by an aesthetic instinct, which follows neither rule nor recipe. 
              After having passed through the gas stove reduction firing at 1300&deg;C, 
              the vessel itself will prove whether the right decisions were made. 
              Beauty is not manufactured; it is a gift that manifests itself only 
              in the finish work.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1650.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1650.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1563.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1563.jpg" width="113" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a><a href="images/martin_schlotz/w1713.jpg"><img src="images/martin_schlotz/thumbs/w1713.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="1" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>In addition to interest in pottery, Martin Schlotz also experimented 
              in the past few years with self-made porcelain, which is more difficult 
              to handle than stoneware. Plain or colored, rose-gray or olive-green, 
              the surface of porcelain remains unglazed. These pieces are composed 
              only of horizontal strips of dark engobe or light porcelain, which 
              distinguish the vessel&#8217;s individual components from one another, 
              or mediate between the changes in the silhouette. Some pieces have 
              pure white porcelain finishes that materialize out of roughened 
              chamotte forms. From this intertwining of form and color, the compositional 
              complexity of a seemingly simple vessel is increased. The composition, 
              form, and coloring of the vessel must arise from a multitude of 
              combinational possibilities in the limited array of formal and chromatic 
              elements. The ostensibly minute playground then widens to an infinity 
              of nuance. The sequence of artistic decisions, whose consequences 
              are revealed in the final product, remains legible upon close examination. 
              Realize then, that the countless potential paths that were never 
              taken would have led to so many vessels that will never exist. Particularly 
              because of his inexorably harsh and utterly creative determination, 
              the vessels created by Marin Schlotz palpitate in the wake of obvious 
              implausibility: a challenge for both our aesthetic sensibility and 
              logical minds. Shall we critically evaluate each individual form, 
              in order to correct the artist&#8217;s chosen decisions in our mind&#8217;s 
              eye? Or perhaps we may simply embrace our artistic intuition and 
              merely love these works for their raw and unhindered beauty.</p>
