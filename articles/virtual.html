            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Over the past two thousand years 
              the fundamentals of craft have not changed. We basically form craft 
              objects and craft products with our hands. This century has seen 
              the rise of electricity aid us in the making of craft, but still 
              its broader practice has changed little. Now at the close of the 
              2nd millennium craft is being revolutionized by bytes and bits - 
              the art of computing. From the first self-conscious steps with Photoshop 
              to the higher sophistication of 3D imaging, VRML, animation and 
              multi-media, craft is breaking its age-old shackles of materiality 
              and entering a new dimension - the dimension of virtual craft. Craft 
              is beginning to inhabit information space. It is merging with computer 
              technologies to create a new hybrid art or craft form, informed 
              by equal parts of the old and the new.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">This transformation of craft 
              will be unexpected and rejected and attacked by many. The proclamation 
              of a new computer craft will be seen as a sacrilege by many. But 
              we are not inventing something that does not already exist, but 
              acknowledging tendencies already well under way, giving them a name, 
              making them easier to recognize. Those who are attentive to, and 
              do not close their eyes to the 'new technologies' will see its influences 
              already manifesting in craft: laser cutting techniques, stereo lithography, 
              mathematically influenced CAD, 3D rendering, VRML craft worlds et 
              cetera.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ceramics have played a significant 
              role for mankind and have literally been around for millennia. We 
              may look towards the ancient Egyptians, the Phoenicians, Assyrians 
              or even the native peoples of the ancient Americas. From the first 
              clumps of earth accidentally fired in a camp-fire to the first functional 
              pit fired vessels. Little has really changed since that time. We 
              still use fire to create our pottery - in wood kilns or gas kilns. 
              The ancient techniques of raku and pit-firings are still very popular. 
              We form works by using our hands to deform, mould and assemble the 
              clay and throw pots on wheels. In some quarters – I am told - the 
              kick-wheel is still alive and kicking. We may now have electric 
              wheels and kilns and other gadgets, but these items don't really 
              constitute a fundamental change in, or addition to our tools and 
              materials.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">However, I would say that things 
              are looking a bit different now as we rapidly approach the third 
              millennium. Technology is advancing at an ever-increasing speed. 
              Today anyone can buy a computer with more processing power than 
              a 1960's mainframe computer which took up a whole office block, 
              for around $1000. In western societies at least, the computer is 
              becoming a ubiquitous tool, with a strong presence in universities, 
              schools, libraries and of course business and the workplace. Even 
              primary school kids are going to school with their own laptops. 
              They may spend most of their time playing games on them, but that 
              will be the fertile ground on which their other digital capabilities 
              will grow.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The possibility of purchasing 
              great processing power at low prices has had a tangible effect on 
              the arts and crafts with more and more artists working in the digital 
              area, not to mention other applications like desktop publishing, 
              word processing, spreadsheeting etc. The computer screen lends itself 
              to the production of 2D images, which are not that far removed from 
              traditional paintings, prints or watercolours, so a fairly strong 
              arena of digital art has established itself. But Digital Craft? 
              Virtual Ceramics? Can there really be such a thing? Well, yes, some 
              ceramic artists and other craftspeople are incorporating the computer 
              and its multitude of possibilities into their work. The notion of 
              digital craft is being talked about and written about – here in 
              Australia by such people as Kevin Murray, or in the United states 
              by Malcolm McCullough or Stanley Lechtzin.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ceramic artists are not just 
              by creating web sites for themselves, or storing their images digitally, 
              but also manipulating their images, and creating work, which at 
              least initially exists in the virtual space of the computer monitor, 
              by using 2D software programs like Photoshop or 3D modeling programs 
              like Lightwave.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The way we view these types 
              of works is usually on a screen. Actually we may not be so aware 
              of it but we are surrounded by screens: the computer screen, the 
              TV screen, the slide projection screen, the cinema screen, even 
              the advertising billboard… The computer screen itself appears to 
              contain the images or data we are looking at within its physical 
              dimensions, although it actually only displays the data which is 
              stored somewhere else, the hard drive. This virtual space of the 
              computer monitor can be viewed as an exhibition space of sorts. 
              Of course you do get 'virtual galleries' on the Net, and the data 
              stored on computers around the world is often referred to as 'information 
              space' - an alternative type of space or reality. But the computer 
              monitor also physically extends itself into space with its external 
              dimensions and the possibility of creating 3D worlds on the screen 
              creates an internal visual space. This alternative exhibition space 
              could be called the 'New White Cube'. That other ‘white cube’ being 
              of course the traditional gallery space with its four neutral white 
              walls.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">These are works, like all others, 
              which are initially conceived in the mind – a type of virtual space 
              in itself - and then realised using computer software. They are 
              made of the stuff of the digital realm, namely bytes and bits, which 
              are basically combinations of the digits zero and one.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Ceramics that exist in cyberspace 
              may be called 'Virtual Ceramics'. Cyberspace is not something that 
              can be measured in centimetres or inches. In a way, it can be understood 
              as a virtual reality, a type of alternative digital world, made 
              by real people, that we experience through manifestations on our 
              computer screen. It has become a very real element in our lives 
              and is no more or less real than other spaces.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">While some people have trouble 
              accepting virtual ceramics as objects or even object to calling 
              them ceramics, these things do exist. They just exist in another 
              realm than we are used to. The computer file is a bit like a plaster 
              mould. Once you have made the mould, you can cast as many objects 
              from it as you like. Similarly, with a computer file you can print 
              as many prints of an image as you like, or go even further and produce 
              as many objects on a milling machine as you like. Where does the 
              justification for the term ‘ceramic’ come in? This can come from 
              many sources – it may be a chosen ceramic surface that we apply 
              to the virtual object, it may come from historical references we 
              assign to the virtual object or it may just be a traditional ceramic 
              form, like a teapot – easily recognisable by anyone.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Virtual Ceramics are not just 
              designs made for industrial production, i.e. CAD/CAM, but a hybrid 
              form of ceramics combined with elements of computer art and design, 
              which constitute something altogether new and different. Of course 
              the rise of a new ‘virtual ceramic’ aesthetic also poses many new 
              questions such as <I>When is a piece virtual and when is it not?</I> 
              <I>Where are the boundries?</I> Clearly the definitions have to 
              be refined. One could ask &quot;Is there an original?&quot; The 
              computer file can be copied ad infinitum without any loss in quality, 
              so can it be the original? Or is the print of a model the original 
              or the first solid output, made on a milling machine or lathe? If 
              the notion of the original or one-off is negated by the digital 
              medium, what does this mean for the craftsperson or collector? Another 
              question which arises from these issues is that of copyright. Because 
              the digital medium can be copied so easily, is there a danger there? 
              When someone buys a digital art work or virtual ceramic, who retains 
              copyright of that work? One big problem we have when dealing with 
              this relatively new area is that of terminology. We haven’t yet 
              developed a proper language to deal with virtual craft. Antagonisms 
              between different camps in this matter sometimes arise purely from 
              differences in interpretations of definitions. When you say ‘a mug’ 
              you mean a ceramic mug. If I say ‘virtual mug’, you might see a 
              contradiction in terms. Yet if I show you a photo of a mug, you 
              will say ‘that is a mug’ – the signifier becoming the signified 
              - but why is no longer a mug when it is created digitally? The digital 
              mug is actually much more multi-dimensional and than the photo, 
              as it can be viewed and manipulated 3-dimensionally.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">One fear of some ceramists and 
              potters with their feet firmly rooted in the various age-old ceramics 
              traditions have, is that computers and other new technologies are 
              taking over and replacing those old traditions. Will we all end 
              up just sitting at computer terminals, hacking away at keyboards, 
              modelling in bytes and bits and leaving the actual act of production 
              up to machines? Will we all be turned into designers?</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The computer offers us some 
              avenues of exploration that were previously not possible. While 
              it may be a steep learning curve to master some of the necessary 
              software, even simple programs can offer a high level of design 
              flexibility. Simple functions like lathing or extruding forms, which 
              relate to actions we are used to from handling clay, can be replicated 
              on the computer and put to good effect. Freed from the constraints 
              of the material world, potters and ceramists are free to let their 
              imaginations run wild and create imaginary works with a high level 
              of realism. This can go as far as creating not only quasi-ceramic 
              objects, but whole scenes or worlds. In cyberspace there is no gravity, 
              so tea can flow upwards from a teapot, virtual clay can be made 
              to do things which would be impossible in the physical realm. You 
              might ask &quot;why&quot;. I ask &quot;why not&quot;? And if you 
              wanted to make an actual work in clay, a model could be worked on 
              in 3D before actually rendering it in a ceramic medium.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The possibility of disregarding 
              the law of gravity, importing surfaces from any source, deforming 
              and manipulating and combining different elements, gives the ceramist 
              a new set of tools which can help to visualise ideas, view ceramics 
              from a different perspective and even to create alternate ceramic 
              realities. But Virtual Craft need not be restricted to the virtual 
              walls of the 'New White Cube'. Virtual Craft may also be translated 
              into actual works in clay or other materials. These may be a straight 
              translation of 3D modelled objects into clay. Resourceful potters 
              may also source alternative technologies to materialise their work, 
              such as Judith Cook's use of a new decal manufacturing and firing 
              process, or Les Lawrence's use of inkjet printers with fireable 
              inks. Possibly the most advanced technique of creating work at the 
              moment is the use of the industrial techniques of Rapid Prototyping, 
              Stereolithography and Selective Laser Sintering. These techniques 
              are used in industry to create models for industrial testing and 
              manufacture and are still quite expensive. A 20cm bowl could cost 
              thousands to make, but this technology will eventually come down 
              in price.</FONT></P>

              file of a 3D model to cut slices of paper, which are bonded together 
              layer by layer, building up an object. Stereolithography uses computer 
              controlled lasers to harden a resin bath in increments of one tenth 
              of a millimeter. As you can imagine, incredible detail becomes possible. 
              Selective Laser sintering is a similar technique that uses a mixture 
              of nylon and glass powder, which is then also hardened by lasers.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">In fact, I would not be surprised 
              if one day, we will have kilns that 'fire' clay by sintering a clay 
              powder with computer guided lasers. Technology may even go further 
              and at some time in the not-too-distant future, we may be able to 
              rearrange the molecules of the air to produce any desired material. 
              Experiments in this direction are already happening. The result 
              would be a 'ceramics replicator' - a machine which might look similar 
              to a microwave and would create an object chosen from a 'menu' - 
              maybe an Alessi or Walter Gropius teapot, a Leach Bottle or an Anagama 
              water jar, or maybe even a 2nd century BC Greek Vase.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">I realise that many of you will 
              scoff at such ideas, but with rapid prototyping, nano-technology 
              and self-replicating machines, we are already moving in this direction. 
              Less than a decade ago, we wouldn’t have thought it possible to 
              manipulate genes so well that we could clone other beings. Yet not 
              long ago a sheep named ‘Dolly’was cloned. And a doctor in the USA 
              is openly working towards cloning the first human being. It's certainly 
              not going to hurt to be aware of current developments and future 
              possibilities. And let's not forget that it's not always easy to 
              foresee the future correctly. In 1949, the magazine <I>Popular Mechanics</I>, 
              forecasting the development of computer technology, suggested that 
              "Computers in the future may weigh only 1.5 tons" (!).</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Of course much of Virtual Ceramics 
              is based on imagery and to a degree illusion. In a majority of cases, 
              our visual knowledge of the world, it’s art and ceramics, is based 
              on what we know from books, magazines and other media. Knowledge 
              is brought into our living room via television. Ceramic objects 
              we have never seen in the flesh are brought to our attention via 
              magazines and catalogues. As we may never have seen the actual ceramic 
              objects, this is also a form of virtuality. In contrast to previous 
              ages, today the dominance of the image is complete, with mass media, 
              photography, video, television, and now affordable digital photography, 
              scanners, high quality inkjet printing and ever cheaper, more powerful 
              computers. In fact the material value of a computer is less than 
              $100, and in the US, some companies are starting to give them away, 
              paid for by advertising that flashes up on the side of the screen.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <FONT FACE="Arial">Art is a type of illusionism, 
              exemplified in the works of MC Escher, 17th century Delftware or 
              18th century German Renaissance ceramics, or on a more contemporary 
              note, the work of Elisabeth Fritsch or Wayne Higby. With Virtual 
              Ceramics, this is even more so the case, although trompe l'oeill 
              isn’t necessarily the intention. But the possibilities of today’s 
              software go far beyond what we might be able to recognise. Today 
              we can create realistic images, which are difficult, if not nearly 
              impossible to distinguish from the ‘real thing’. Of course this 
              raises the question of what sort of world we are living in. Is it 
              a world of visual lies? Are we already in ‘The Matrix’? When shown 
              an image of a manipulated pot at College in Melbourne, one lecturer's 
              response was 'oh, when did you make that?' My reply was 'I didn't'. 
              Since then the realism of the imagery of Virtual Ceramics in my 
              own</font><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">work 
              and that of others has increased considerably.</font></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The stereographic image of the 
              Virtual Ceramic lends even more credibility to the illusion, the 
              eyes perceiving a 3D virtual scene that is deceptively real. The 
              next step from here will be to create a fully immersible 3D Virtual 
              Reality environment, perhaps a ceramics gallery, where, with the 
              help of a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and data gloves, you would 
              actually be able to move around in the environment and pick up and 
              touch things. I suspect that you may be able to experience this 
              type of technology in a few years time.</FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">The philosophy behind these 
              explorations is not mere CAD/CAM, not the use of the computer as 
              another design or production aid, but rather the use of the technology 
              to broaden the horizon of traditional crafts practice, to create 
              new unforeseen methods and new unforeseen real and virtual craft 
              objects. The intent of these explorations is not to jettison traditional 
              crafts practices and replace them with industrial techniques, after 
              all, this is a phase we already went through in the 19th C, but 
              it is the intent of these explorations to add new elements, techniques 
              and results to what we already know and have. </FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">No, craft will not die. As long 
              as we have material and aesthetic needs, craft will fulfil many 
              of them. But as our intellects evolve, so too will our needs concerning 
              craft - and crafts practice will evolve or perhaps revolutionise 
              itself. To stop now and say "you can't drink from a virtual cup" 
              would be stepping backwards. Virtual cups were never made to drink 
              from in the first place. Rather, armed with a new set of tools, 
              we will create virtual objects for virtual purposes, with the very 
              real possibility of artful and craftful manifestations. </FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial">Today the craftsperson can become 
              a programmer, and the programmer can become a craftsperson; what 
              is of interest, and what will reinvigorate the crafts in the 3rd 
              millennium, is where the two areas intersect. No, craft is not dead, 
              but it will never be the same again.</FONT></P>
