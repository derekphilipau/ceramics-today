            <p>Ironically, this was the title of my MFA Thesis at the University 
              of Georgia in 1973. I'll try to explain as simply as possible 
              where this research has taken me in the last 24 years. 
            <p><a href="images/salku/salku1.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku1.jpg" alt="Salku vessel by Rick Berman" width="127" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>From 
              the very beginning of my clay life in 1968, I have felt this amazing 
              affinity for those nasty wood-fired pots from the &#8220;Six Ancient 
              Kilns&#8221; of Japan: Shigaraki, Tamba, Echizen, Tokoname, Seto, 
              and Bizen. The whole idea of a pot being put into a kiln and allowing 
              it to become nature itself just blows me away! I guess the things 
              going on in the U.S. in the '60s and early '70s that 
              were closest to these Japanese pots were what Don Reitz was doing 
              with salt and Paul Soldner and Howard Shapiro were doing with raku. 
            <p><a href="images/salku/salku2.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku2.jpg" alt="Salku vessel by Rick Berman" width="158" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>I 
              was experimenting with both of these techniques in graduate school 
              and somehow had the idea to combine the two: thus SALKU. I built 
              a small, hard brick updraft top-loading kiln and fired with a homemade 
              venturi burner and propane. The pots were stacked not touching and 
              I used about five pounds of salt (but who's counting?) when 
              the kiln got to cone 06. Salt will volitalize at cone 06 but obviously 
              if the clay isn't vitrified, the salt just goes through the 
              cross section of the pot wall until it &#8220;fills up.&#8221; The 
              net result was a slight sheen, but no orange peel surface. I took 
              the pots out of the kiln hot and smoked them in sawdust. The slight 
              glaze sheen crazed because of the thermal shock, and a very subtle 
              white crackle occurred. The key word here is &#8220;subtle.&#8221; 
              Now you might say at this point, &#8220;What's the point?&#8221;&#8211; 
              and that's pretty much what I said, too &#8211; but it <i>was</i> 
              research and I <i>did</i> graduate.</p>
            <p> <a href="images/salku/salku5.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku5.jpg" alt="Salku platter by Rick Berman" width="127" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>Now 
              fast forward to 1977 and a workshop at Tennessee State University 
              in Johnson City. We packed the pots in a soft brick kiln, lit the 
              burner, set it to what I thought was a slow, even flame, and went 
              inside to look at slides. After probably an hour and a half or so, 
              we went back to the kiln to find the most beautiful white heat I've 
              ever seen...at least cone 8. All I could think to do at this point 
              was to throw in about ten pounds of salt, let it do its salt thing 
              for about 20 minutes, and shut it down. We took the top off and 
              started to unload the pots. It was without a doubt the biggest mess 
              I've ever seen! Pulling the pots apart was kind of like pulling 
              taffy&#8212;total disaster except for one pot that was in the bottom 
              middle of the whole mess. To this day, it is probably the most beautiful 
              pot I've ever seen. It was dry, wet, black, orange, grey, 
              with beautiful scars and warps. Except for Marvin Tadlock, who made 
              the pot, and me, people were not amused. (Too bad we live in such 
              a product oriented society.)</p>
            <p> <a href="images/salku/salku4.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku4.jpg" alt="Salku vessel by Rick Berman" width="119" height="125" border="0" align="left"></a>Well, 
              anyway, fast forward again to 1990 when I was doing a raku workshop 
              for my dear friend Tom Zwierlein at his studio in the country near 
              Lexington, Kentucky. On the second day, he asked if I'd like 
              to try a saggar salt technique he'd been working with. I'm 
              always up for stealing other people's ideas, so of course 
              I said yes. He took a saggar (a Lays potato chip can) and went to 
              work. He lined the bottom of the can with charcoal and vermiculite, 
              then pots, then salt, then charcoal, then pots, etc. until the can 
              was full. We put the can in the fiber drum raku kiln, fired it to 
              1850 F degrees, opened the kiln, took out the saggar, and unloaded 
              the pots and quenched them in water. Every pot was a killer! Orange, 
              red, black, grey, white, spots, lines, etc.</p>
            <p> After that, I started using the technique in my workshops and 
              teaching. Then one day about two years later, a light bulb went 
              on. SALKU! 1973! Duh. There <i>were</i> some problems at this point. 
              Number one, the salt was eating up the fiber drums, and if the pots 
              were fired much below about cone 04, they turned into chia pets 
              in about two weeks and totally disintegrated. This wasn't 
              too good for public relations. I felt kind of like a traveling spot 
              remover salesman who needs to keep moving.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/salku/salku_kiln.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku_kiln.jpg" width="127" height="175" hspace="3" border="0"></a><a href="images/salku/salku3.jpg"><img src="images/salku/thumbs/salku3.jpg" width="106" height="175" hspace="3" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> At any rate, I built a small soft brick (scrap) updraft Salku 
              kiln and corbled in the top with a 5-inch flue. The kiln measured 
              2-1/2 bricks across and about 15 courses high, roughly six or seven 
              cubic feet. The whole kiln became a saggar, so we eliminated the 
              potato chip cans. Now I'm tumble stacking tenmoku and ash-glazed 
              pots with a half bag of charcoal all through the pots and I'm 
              firing to approximately cone 10 in four or five hours. I use about 
              5 lbs. of salt and the pots are getting some beautiful black orange 
              peel from the melting charcoal, and sometimes stick together so 
              when they are pulled apart, some dramatic scarification is happening. 
              Remember those nasty Japanese pots mentioned above? Well, with a 
              lot of help from nature, I'm seeing surfaces now that I never 
              thought were possible. Making pots is even more of a joy when you 
              love the surface possibilities so much that you literally can't 
              wait to see the next group of pots come out of the kiln. I am very 
              grateful.</p>
