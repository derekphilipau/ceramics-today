                  in the distance, curves to the left, leaving the last part out 
                  of sight.</span></p>
                <p><span id="lBody" class="pageTemplateBody">Lining the walls 
                  and filling the floor-space are more than a hundred ceramic 
                  vases, jars, jugs, plates, oil lamps and chests, from the gigantic 
                  to the diminutive. Gracefully shaped, colored and gilded, decorated 
                  with intricate geometric, floral and calligraphic designs, all 
                  are in the 14th and 15th-century style of the Nasrid period 
                  when the Alhambra was built: the last 200 years of Muslim rule, 
                  when the arts in southern Spain flourished as never before.</span></p>
                <p><span id="lBody" class="pageTemplateBody">Anyone with an interest 
                  in Andalusian history entering here would rub his eyes in disbelief 
                  and delight. Nearly all these ceramic pieces are lusterware, 
                  made by a complicated process that was gradually lost from this 
                  land after 1492, when the Muslims were finally expelled from 
                  Spain following the Christian conquest of the Kingdom of Granada.</span></p>

                          with this transparent, metallic overglaze are called 
                          <em>loza dorada</em> (&#8220;golden pottery&#8221;) 
                          in Spanish, though, strictly speaking, the pieces may 
                          be any of several tints&#8212;both silver and gold tinged 
                          with green are common. The earliest lusterware was created 
                          at the beginning of the ninth century in Basra and Chuff, 
                          in what is now Iraq. Soon afterward, the artisans of 
                          Samarra, 125 kilometers (75 mi) north of Baghdad on 
                          the Tigris River, started to create large quantities 
                          to supply the courts of the Abbasid Caliphate, from 
                          India in the east to Al-Andalus &#8212;Muslim-ruled 
                          southern Spain&#8212;in the west. The technique also 
                          soon flourished in Egypt. From there, some two centuries 
                          later, artisans of Al-Andalus learned enough to start 
                          their own production, reaching their apogee of beauty 
                          and sophistication in the period of the Alhambra.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"> At first, lusters were 
                          made by applying pure metals like gold, silver, platinum, 
                          tin and copper&#8212;each for its distinctive color&#8212;to 
                          fired and wholly or partially glazed clay (&#8220;bisque&#8221;), 
                          which was then refired at a lower temperature. The resulting 
                          combination of glaze base and metallic sheen enhanced 
                          the lines and colors of the decoration. Later, the technique 
                          was refined by using metal oxides, which were also applied 
                          on top of the glaze base with a fine brush. (In a different, 
                          far less expensive process, pigment-based lusters, developed 
                          in the 19th century, often characterize commercial ceramics 
                          and porcelains up to the present day.)</span></p>
                        <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"> Jiménez explains his 
                          Alhambran luster technique in his typically exuberant 
                          fashion, which itself may be a legacy from the Moorish 
                          past. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a constant dialogue with all 
                          the elements of the cosmos: oxygen, earth, water, fire 
                          and time&#8230;. The process consists in converting 
                          metal into oxide and then oxide back into metal. Metal 
                          plus oxygen produces oxide. So if we now remove the 
                          oxygen from the oxide we added previously, we again 
                          get metal&#8212;a luster. The Arabs had this down to 
                          a fine art.&#8221;</span></p>
                        <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"> Complex lusters, he 
                          says, may require firing more than once&#8212;and some 
                          as many as six times. </span></p></td>

                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Very few examples of the old 
                  lusterware have survived the last five centuries. One of the 
                  most famous is the enormous, amphora-shaped &#8220;Alhambra 
                  Vase&#8221; (also known as the &#8220;Vase of the Gazelles&#8221;), 
                  and a replica of it is a centerpiece in this Pavilion. Were 
                  I to make a guess as to how long it would have taken an artisan 
                  of Al-Andalus to produce it and all the rest of these riches, 
                  I would suggest a couple of lifetimes.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Wrong! They have all been produced 
                  by one man, and he is alive and well, and full of energy and 
                  ideas. Miguel Ruíz Jiménez is a short, bearded, powerfully-built 
                  man in his mid-50&#8217;s. Said his wife, Ana, &#8220;He did 
                  it all himself, with his own hands. And he built the Pavilion 
                  as well. That alone took him 15 years!&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"><a href="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/VasodelasGacelas.jpg"><img src="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/thumbs/VasodelasGacelas.jpg" alt="Jim&eacute;nez - Las Gazelas" width="207" height="300" border="0" align="left"></a>And 
                  he&#8217;s filled his Pavilion only not with his art, but also 
                  a huge studio, an auditorium and research facilities. A stone&#8217;s 
                  throw away, he runs a small factory that employs 24 people to 
                  produce the kind of decorative Andalusian pottery found in local 
                  shops. It is a separate world from his Nasrid-style lusterware, 
                  whose prices range all the way from &#8364; 100 to &#8364; 60,000 
                  ($120&#8211;$72,000).</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">I thought a local Granada newspaper 
                  had exaggerated wildly when it described Jiménez as &#8220;a 
                  sketcher, welder, potter, wood carver, chemist, blacksmith, 
                  painter, writer, architect, sculptor and artist.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Jiménez likes to refer to what 
                  he does as &#8220;alchemy.&#8221; In a way, this makes sense, 
                  for the origin of the word is the Arabic <em>al-kimiya&#8217;</em>, 
                  which connotes transmutation. This is particularly apt for the 
                  lusterware, whose often golden color is achieved through a complicated, 
                  even arcane process.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">He has followed the authentic 
                  Arab tradition in the making of Alhambran glazed pottery,&#8221; 
                  says Ana Carreño, editor of <em>El Legado Andalusí</em>, a cultural 
                  magazine based in Granada. His research is &#8220;serious and 
                  accurate,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and his determination and 
                  effort over 25 years has led to recognition here in Spain and 
                  in the Gulf Arab countries through exhibitions, television programs 
                  and workshops.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Son of a simple <em>granadino</em> 
                  potter, Jiménez got clay on his hands as soon as he could crawl. 
                  By seven he was throwing pottery. What set his artistic passions 
                  afire more than 30 years ago was the discovery of the sensual 
                  loveliness of the old Andalusian art. &#8220;When I contemplated 
                  the vases of the Alhambra, I decided that I wanted to do this, 
                  and I started to research and study,&#8221; he says. The path 
                  he took was very different from that of his father.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">The task was gigantic: Jiménez 
                  studied chemistry, and he visited Nasrid masterpieces worldwide. 
                  There are, he says, no original, firsthand written sources. 
                  From Nasrid times, only the bare names of a few ceramists have 
                  been found&#8212;Suleiman Alfaqui, Sancho Almurci, Hadmet Albane, 
                  Felipe Frances, Abdul Aziz, Abel Allah Alfogey. Of their techniques, 
                  there is nothing.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">In 1990, Jiménez published the 
                  story of his research and struggle to recreate, experiment by 
                  experiment, the period&#8217;s ceramics in a self-published 
                  book titled <em>The Epic of Clay</em>. Here, his mystical streak 
                  comes out in prose as florid as his Nasrid arabesques: &#8220;Formulae 
                  and excessive pretension of technical precision are at times 
                  superfluous,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;for meeting the complex 
                  challenge of combining substance and space in pursuit of an 
                  intuitive art and dreamed shapes when confronted by a series 
                  of subtle factors, as unforeseeable, as variable, as those that 
                  determine the tonality, texture, coloring, and metallic intensity 
                  of the tones and, more specifically, what is going to be the 
                  singular identity of the masterpiece.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">A little further on he writes 
                  of the <em>duende</em>, the spirit or soul, required to make 
                  lusterware. &#8220;We must feel intensely and with the greatest 
                  profundity those indefinite factors that, although they take 
                  us to a foreseen outcome, oscillate during the whole process 
                  in a wide abyss of contingency.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">To recreate the Nasrid masterpiece 
                  style, he found clays and minerals both locally and as far afield 
                  as China, South Africa, England and France. Over four decades 
                  he studied the materials, built Arab-style kilns and fired them 
                  to reach temperatures up to 1040 degrees Centigrade (1904°F). 
                  (Examples of Arab-type kilns can still be found in ceramics 
                  centers such as Paterna and Manises.) For as long as anyone 
                  knows, the potters of this region have used &#8220;mountain 
                  wood&#8221;&#8212;thyme, rosemary and gorse&#8212;to achieve 
                  high temperatures and just the right kind of smoke. Jiménez 
                  used the same, varying his materials, varying his temperatures, 
                  shifting the placements of objects inside the kiln.</span></p>
                <p align="center"><a href="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/LasGacelasdetail.jpg"><img src="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/thumbs/LasGacelasdetail.jpg" alt="Detail: Las Gazelas" width="302" height="200" border="0"></a></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">He also taught himself to draw 
                  the intricate calligraphy, &#8220;profuse and complex symmetry 
                  of plant motifs, geometric stylizations, chain patterns, borders 
                  and trimmings, stars, polygons&#8221; and more, all replicating 
                  or inspired by Nasrid originals. One large vase, he explains, 
                  has a surface area of two or three square meters (40 to 60 sq 
                  ft) densely covered with designs that have to settle on the 
                  curvilinear, irregular and multifaceted surfaces. Sketch after 
                  sketch, drawing after drawing, rejection after rejection, it 
                  may require as many as 300 or 400 drawings &#8220;with the corresponding 
                  days and days of laborious work and continuous meditation.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"><a href="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/platter.jpg"><img src="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/thumbs/platter.jpg" alt="Jim&eacute;nez Platter" width="208" height="200" border="0" align="left"></a>Then, 
                  for a masterpiece like the Alhambra Vase, which weighs about 
                  100 kilograms (220 lb) and stands 1.5 meters high(4' 10"), the 
                  throwing is itself a process no less mind-boggling that may 
                  take Jiménez as long asa month. During this time, the upper 
                  part must never be allowed to dry out, lest it become impossible 
                  to join with the other parts, while the lower parts must gradually 
                  dry in order to support the weight of the top parts.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">&#8220;You humanize the piece 
                  with your hands,&#8221; Jiménez says. &#8220;You mark on the 
                  vase your impressions of humanity and sentiment, mastery and 
                  culture.&#8221; It was this attitude, he believes, that enabled 
                  him to match the master craftsmen of Al-Andalus.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">The more I looked into how Jiménez 
                  works, the more I saw a spiritual dimension in his art. The 
                  relationship between him and clay and fire, though based on 
                  years of observation and science, incorporates at least as much 
                  feeling and intuition, of the kind that comes from a master&#8217;s 
                  understanding of each step along a complex path.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">These days, Jiménez&#8217;s 
                  meditations are broken most often by his cell phone, which interrupts 
                  him with questions from customers, family, friends and foremen 
                  in the factory. Watching him made me wonder where Michelangelo 
                  would have got to had he possessed a cell phone.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">In order to focus Jiménez&#8217;s 
                  attention for a talk, we went to lunch&#8212;phone off&#8212;in 
                  a popular village restaurant.</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"><a href="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/vase_detail.jpg"><img src="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/thumbs/vase_detail.jpg" alt="Vase detail" width="294" height="200" border="0" align="left"></a>I 
                  asked whether his large amphora-style vases were indeed exact 
                  copies of known originals or his own designs. He explained that 
                  it was a combination: &#8220;You have to assimilate the [known] 
                  pieces, interpret them and then reconstitute, adding some of 
                  yourself. It is like the construction of a building. There is 
                  some cement, the basic knowledge. So you use the elements you 
                  control to add something more. My approach is that if there 
                  are elements I don&#8217;t know, I search for them,I learn them&#8212;or 
                  I invent them.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">The initial firing of the pieces, 
                  he explains, is one of the most difficult stages. His favorite 
                  kiln for the big pieces is still the Arab, wood-burning kiln. 
                  &#8220;In order to manage the atmosphere in the kiln,&#8221; 
                  he says, &#8220;you have to know how the air functions and moves 
                  in there, parameters, proportions, height, placement, and how 
                  things work between the combustion chamber and the firing section. 
                  When you fill the kiln, you have to place the pieces exactly 
                  according to how you want them done, at the speed you want, 
                  controlling with an opening below. To achieve an atmosphere 
                  for firing properly, air should circulate with a minimum of 
                  oxygen.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">And the smoke plays an important 
                  part, too. &#8220;Smoke&#8212;I cannot explain it. You have 
                  to know the interior of the kiln. You have to dream with it, 
                  think about it burning. Then see how the piece turns out and 
                  compare it with the previous piece. To get there in the end 
                  is an interminable chain of study, trial, error and trial.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody"><img src="images/andalusiasnewgoldenpottery/thumbs/MiguelRuizbigsmile.jpg" width="132" height="200" align="left">Although 
                  by now we know the answer to my question, I ask it anyway: &#8220;Could 
                  you achieve an exact replica?&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Jiménez replies: &#8220;My question 
                  to you is: What would that culture have been doing had it not 
                  been for the horrible interruption 500 years ago, those horrible 
                  wars? I could become a simple messenger from that time, or I 
                  could continue to advance that richness, sensitivity and culture, 
                  that discipline.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">What Jiménez achieved, as I 
                  saw, were near replicas of great fidelity to the originals, 
                  and occasional improvements. Many are his own designs. &#8220;I 
                  copy, research, create an essence, and then at times I add something 
                  from our time, but with all respect toward what those people 
                  did 500years ago.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pageTemplateBody">Lunch is about finished. Jiménez 
                  switches on his phone.It rings instantly. He answers, hangs 
                  up, and it rings again. With an impatient expression, he switches 
                  it off. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get rid of this thing, and 
                  my factory, and all the things that occupy too much of my time. 
                  I want peace and quiet, time to create. That&#8217;s what I 
                  was born to do. I need time to express what I have to express.&#8221; 
                  As a final word, Jiménez says, &#8220;I hope others lean on 
                  what I have humbly done and move ahead.&#8221; </span></p>
