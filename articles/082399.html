              discusses the dangers of copper. 
            <P><B>Introduction&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><IMG align=right SRC="../images/BX2b.jpg" alt="E. Bastarache. Glaze with 3.5% copper oxide" width=167 height=228 hspace=5 vspace=5>This 
              metal is red, brownish, ductile and malleable, and has excellent 
              electrical and thermal conductivity. Copper is an essential element; 
              it is transported in the serum linked to ceruloplasmin.</P>
            <P>The compounds used by potters are&nbsp;: </P>
            <ul>
              <li>black copper oxide, </li>
              <li>red copper oxide,</li>
              <li>copper carbonate.</li>
            </ul>
            <P><B>Sources and Production :</B></P>
            <P><B>I-Chemical Forms&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper forms two (2) series of compounds&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>copper (I) (cuprous) and copper (II) (cupric) compounds.</P>
            <P>Metallic copper is fairly resistant to corrosion and is not attacked 
              by dry air, water, or nonoxidizing acid.</P>
            <P>Copper I oxide (Cu2O) occurs naturally as the reddish mineral cuprite. 
            </P>
            <P>Copper II oxide is black and is obtained by heating copper metal 
              in air.</P>
            <P>In moist air, copper becomes coated with green basic carbonate.</P>
            <P><B>II-Uses and Sources of Exposure&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper was the first metal used by humans and appears to have been 
              discovered on the island of Cyprus around 2500 BC.</P>
            <P>Copper salts have been used therapeutically for more than 2,000 
              years, copper sulfate has clinically been used as an emetic, and 
              it was also a popular murder weapon and abortifacient in France 
              in the 19<SUP>TH</SUP> century.</P>
            <P>Chile, the USA, Canada, and Russia are the principal producers.</P>
            <P>Mined ores of copper are concentrated by a flotation process and 
              then are refined. Smelting consists of applying sufficient heat 
              to concentrate the metal and fuse remaining gangue (waste ore) into 
              slag.</P>
            <P><B>A-Uses&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper is used&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>- in the production of a large variety of alloys having multiple 
              applications ;</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>brass: contains mainly copper and zinc,</LI>
              <LI>bronze: contains mainly copper and tin,</LI>
              <LI>various alloys with silver, cadmium, beryllium, nickel... </LI>
            </UL>
            <P>- in the electrical industry;</P>
            <P>- in the construction industry: gas lines... </P>
            <P>- in pigments such as emerald green, in ceramic glazes, and as 
            </P>
            <P> a salt in the lithographic process. </P>
            <P>-as pesticides (seeds and vineyards) in the form of salts, like 
              the Bordeaux solution based</P>
            <P> on copper sulfate.<BR>
              -copper sulfate is also used in the whitewashing and leather industry.</P>
            <P>-etc.</P>
            <P><B>B-Environmental exposure</b>&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>It occurs primarily from ingestion of drinking water with high 
              copper concentrations and accidental or intentional ingestion of 
              copper salts.</P>
            <P><B>Clinical Toxicology&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><B>I-Routes of exposure&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper is an essential element in mammalian systems. Ilness occurs 
              when diet is deficient or intake is excessive.</P>
            <P>The principal route of exposure is through ingestion, but inhalation 
              of copper dust and fumes occurs in industrial settings. </P>
            <P>Toxicity has resulted from treatment of burns using topical copper 
              compounds.</P>
            <P>Copper has been reported to be absorbed internally from prostheses, 
              intrauterine devices, hemodialysis units using copper-containing 
              equipment, and copper azide impregnation of the skin after an explosion.</P>
            <P><B>II-Absorption, Metabolism, and Elimination&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><B>A-Absorption&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>The daily copper requirement has been estimated at 30 micrograms/kg 
              of body weight for an adult. After ingestion, maximum absorption 
              of copper occurs in the stomach and jejunum.</P>
            <P>Copper is bound initially in the serum to albumin and transcuprein, 
              then later is bound more firmly to ceruloplasmin, which binds more 
              than 75% of circulating copper.</P>
            <P>Absorption is increased in copper deficiency and is impaired in 
              small-bowel disease.</P>
            <P>Copper is distributed throughout the body but is stored primarily 
              in liver, muscle, and bone.</P>
            <P>The normal concentration of copper in blood plasma is 1 mg/liter.<BR>
              In all mammals, copper is an essential trace element involved in&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>-fundamental cellular respiration,</P>
            <P>-free radical defense,</P>
            <P>-connective tissue synthesis,</P>
            <P>-iron metabolism,</P>
            <P>-neurotransmission.<BR>
            </P>
            <P><B>B-Metabolism&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Absorbed copper is initially bound to albumin and is transported 
              from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver where it is transferred 
              to ceruloplasmin.</P>
            <P>Urinary excretion is enhanced by increased molybdenum intake, cirrhosis, 
              and biliary obstruction.</P>
            <P><B>C-Elimination&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper is eliminated principally through the feces after excretion 
              into the bile. Urinary excretion of copper is low in humans.</P>
            <P>Healthy adults have urinary concentrations of less than 100µg per 
              24 hours.</P>
            <P><B>III-Symptoms and Clinical Signs&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><B>A-Acute Toxicity :</B></P>
            <P><B>1-Gastrointestinal&nbsp;Tract :</B></P>
            <P>Because copper is an essential element, toxicity is uncommon, as 
              with all essential elements. </P>
            <P>Most reports of acute toxicity are from suicidal attempts from 
              ingesting copper sulfate. However, death is rare, owing to copper 
              sulfate's emetic properties&nbsp;:</P>
            <P><I>a-Mild forms</I></P>
            <P>Mild forms of poisoning produce only&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>nausea,</li>
              <li>vomiting,</li>
              <li>diarrhea,</li>
              <li>malaise.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>They have been described in patients poisoned by eating or drinking 
              from copper-containing vessels or from a soft-drink dispenser.</P>
            <P><I>b-Severe poisoning&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>Copper sulfate ingestion produces a severe inflammation of the 
              gastrointestinal tract, an amount of 10 g of the sulfate is sufficient 
              to cause these gastrointestinal symptoms&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-pain,</li>
              <li>-nausea,</li>
              <li>-vomiting,</li>
              <li>-diarrhea,</li>
              <li>-malaise,</li>
              <li>-hematemesis,</li>
              <li>-melena,</li>
            </ul>
            <P>Also, the following are encountered&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-convulsions,</li>
              <li>-dehydration,</li>
              <li>-shock,</li>
              <li>-hemolysis,</li>
              <li>-liver and kidney necrosis.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>Patients who developed intense jaundice from liver centrolobular 
              necrosis after massive acute copper sulfate poisonning had a more 
              fulminant course than did patients with milder jaundice from intravascular 
              hemolysis.</P>
            <P>The oxydule or the basic carbonate can also cause the intoxication 
              at the same dose.</P>
            <P>Gastrointestinal effects, including anorexia, nausea, and occasional 
              diarrhea, have been attributed to swallowing copper dust.</P>
            <P><B>2-Eye &nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><I>Chalcosis corneae</i> is the impregnation of the eye with elemental 
              copper or copper alloys. This brownish or greenish-brown discoloration 
              of the cornea, lens, or iris may occur after penetrating injuries 
              with copper fragments.</P>
            <P>Copper sulfate, copper acetoarsenite, and verdigris cause irritation 
              and inflammation but no permanent damage.</P>
            <P>Copper chloride and copper cyanide plating bath can cause severe 
              reactions and permanent opacifications.</P>
            <P>Transient irritation of the eyes has followed exposure to a fine 
              dust of oxidation products of copper produced in an electric arc.</P>
            <P><B>3-Respiratory Tract :</B></P>
            <P><I>Typical metal fume fever</i> is characterized by&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-nasal congestion,</li>
              <li>-fever up to 39 C,</li>
              <li>-chills,</li>
              <li>-malaise,</li>
              <li>-aching muscles,</li>
              <li>-dryness in the mouth and throat,</li>
              <li>-headache,</li>
              <li>-shortness of breath,</li>
              <li>-leucocytosis up to 12,000 to 16,000.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>The symptoms generally develop after <I>repeated exposure</I> during 
              the work week, tending to diminish toward the end of the week, only 
              to return more prominently on reexposure after the weekend. This 
              phenomenon has led to the term <I>Monday morning fever.</i></P>
            <P>All symptoms resolve after removal from exposure.</P>
            <P>The illness is postulated to result from immune mechanisms, but 
              no report of chronic toxicity.</P>
            <P>Inhalation of copper salts may cause irritation of the respiratory 
              tract.</P>
            <P>Inhalation of copper fumes may cause nausea, metallic taste, and 
              discoloration of the skin and hair.</P>
            <P><B>4-Renal System :</B></P>
            <P>Kidney abnormalities have been observed after copper sulfate ingestion. 
            </P>
            <P>Hematuria, rising blood urea nitrogen, and oliguria were frequently 
              observed in a large series of poisonnings. A picture of acute tubular 
              necrosis was observed on urinalysis and renal biopsy.</P>
            <P>Intravascular hemolysis but not hypertension, preceded developement 
              of acute tubular necrosis.</P>
            <P><B>5-Neurologic System&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>No evidence substantiates neurologic injury from acquired copper 
              toxicity.</P>
            <P>Coma observed in acute copper sulfate poisoning probably results 
              from uremia.</P>
            <P><B>6-Hematologic System&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Hemolytic anemia accompanies severe copper sulfate poisoning and 
              additionally follows burn treatment with copper sulfate and hemodialysis 
              using copper-containing dialyzing equipement.</P>
            <P>Hemolytic anemia also occurs sporadically in Wilsons disease, 
              the hemolysis is precipitous in these situations.</P>
            <P><B>B-Chronic Toxicity&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>In rats, degenerative modifications in the liver and the kidney 
              have been described in animals receiving, in a chronic manner, copper 
              salts by ingestion (more than 4,000 ppm in foodstuffs).<BR>
              In man, the same modifications (eventually accompanied by encephalopathy) 
              have been described mainly in patients suffering from Wilson's disease.<BR>
              Chronic disease from excessive copper storage is epitomized by Wilsons 
              disease, an inherited, autosomal recessive error in copper metabolism. 
              This disease is characterized by excess copper deposition in most 
              organs, especially the liver, kidneys, brain, and eyes. </P>
            <P>It is characterized by a diminished capacity to eliminate copper 
              via bile.</P>
            <P>Wilsons disease also termed <I>hepatolenticular degeneration</I>, 
              owing to the prominent effects on the liver (cirrhosis) and eye. 
              Chelating treatment with D-penicillamine gives excellent therapeutic 
              results while the preferred maintenance treatment is 150 mg of zinc 
              orally per day.</P>
            <P>High copper content in drinking water and food may contribute to 
              the development of severe liver damage (cirrhosis) in <I>infants</I>.</P>
            <P><B>1-Skin&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper causes a greenish coloration of skin, nails, hair and teeth.</P>
            <P>Contact dermatitis (copper itch) due to copper is rare and its 
              occurrence can be substantiated by careful patch testing. </P>
            <P>Eczematous dermatitis and urticaria have been associated with the 
              use of copper intrauterine devices.</P>
            <P><B>2-Eye&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>The penetration of copper particles in the eye was responsible 
              for cataract. </P>
            <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
            <P><B>3-Respiratory System :</B></P>
            <P>Chronic recurrent inhalation of copper fumes and dust can lead 
              to nasal septal perforation</P>
            <P>Chronic exposure to copper dust and fumes in the industrial setting 
              can lead to upper respiratory complaints and physical findings in 
              workers.</P>
            <P>Long-term exposure to dust in copper refining was not associated 
              with chronic obstructive disease or small airway disease.</P>
            <P>The higher incidence of respiratory cancer reported in copper smelters 
              is due to the presence of arsenic in the ore.</P>
            <P><B>4-Vineyard Sprayers lung&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Vineyard sprayers lung disease occurred when Bordeaux solution 
              (1 to 2% solution of copper sulfate neutralized with lime) was chronically 
              sprayed by Portuguese vineyard workers.</P>
            <P>These workers developed interstitial pulmonary disease including&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-histiocytic granulomas,</li>
              <li>-associated nodular fibrohyaline scars containing abundant copper.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>The clinical picture is characterized initially by general symptoms&nbsp;:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>weakness, </LI>
              <LI>loss of appetite, </LI>
              <LI>loss of weight; </LI>
              <LI>dyspnea and cough. </LI>
            </UL>
            <P>Micronodular or reticulonodular lung infiltration, especially in 
              the lower fields, is the most frequent radiological image encountered. 
              The evolution is variable: stabilization or regression or evolution 
              towards a pseudotumoral form as in arthracosilicosis.</P>
            <P>A high incidence of adenocarcinoma, particularly alveolar cell 
              carcinoma, was observed.</P>
            <P>Extensive liver damage was also noted. Biopsies revealed fibrosis, 
              micronodular cirrhosis angiosarcoma, and portal hypertension.</P>
            <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
            <P><B>C-Teratogenesis&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>No teratogenic effects attributed to copper have been observed 
              in humans.</P>
            <P><B>D-Carcinogenesis&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>With the exception of adenocarcinoma of the lung and angiosarcoma 
              of the liver seen in patients with vineyard sprayers lung, no evidence 
              corroborates carcinogenesis from copper exposure.</P>
            <P><B>IV-Management of Toxicity&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><B>A-Clinical Examination&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Careful history taking is essential to diagnose copper poisoning 
              in acutely ill patients.</P>
            <P>The history should contain questions relevant to intentional poisoning 
              with copper salts and to ingestion of food and drink, especially 
              acidic beverages or alcohol prepared in copper-containing vessels. 
              Persons acutely poisoned by copper (especially copper sulfate) should 
              be evaluated initially for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Blue-green 
              vomitus is diagnostic.</P>
            <P>Investigation for abnormal liver and renal function and hemolytic 
              anemia should be conducted. </P>
            <P>Vital signs and urine output should be conducted for hypotension 
              and oliguria.</P>
            <P>The medical history is also cornerstone of investigating dermatits 
              suspected to arise from copper. Inquiry as to exposure to copper 
              salts at work, use of copper-containing jewelry, or use of copper 
              intrauterine device should be conducted. Patch testing may be necessary 
              to confirm the diagnosis.</P>
            <P>A history of delayed onset of fever, chills, shortness of breath, 
              and malaise after exposure to copper fumes should lead to the suspicion 
              of metal fume fever. Fever, rigorous chills, diaphoresis, and wheezing 
              may be noted on physical examination.</P>
            <P><B>B-Laboratory Diagnosis&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><I>1-Severe copper sulfate poisoning&nbsp;: </I></P>
            <P> Laboratory findings in severe copper sulfate poisoning include&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-abnormal hepatocellular function,</li>
              <li>-hyperbilirubinemia (both direct and indirect),</li>
              <li>-elevated blood urea nitrogen,</li>
              <li>-elevated creatinine,</li>
              <li>-hematuria and cellular casts on urinalysis,</li>
              <li>-anemia,</li>
              <li>-positive stool guaiac,</li>
              <li>-elevated serum copper,</li>
              <li>-elevated ceruloplasmin.</li>
            </ul>
            <P><I>2-Metal fume fever&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P> Findings during episodes of metal fume fever include&nbsp;:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>-leukocytosis,</li>
              <li>-abnormal pulmonary function study results&nbsp;:&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <DIR> <DIR> 
            <ul>
              <li>-small airway obstruction, </li>
              <li>-reduced lung volumes,</li>
              <li>-reduced carbon dioxide diffusing capacity.</li>
            </ul>
            </DIR></DIR>
            <ul>
              <li>-abnormal chest X-ray&nbsp;:</li>
              <li>&#9;&#9;-peribronchiolar cuffing,</li>
              <li>&#9;&#9;-hazy infiltrates.</li>
              <li>-elevated urine copper levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <P><B>C-Treatment&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Removal from exposure is often sufficient to resolve most ilnesses 
              associated with copper toxicity.</P>
            <P><I>1-Severe acute poisoning by ingestion&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>In severe acute poisoning by ingestion, emesis should not be induced 
              and rarely is necessary, owing to spontaneous vomiting. </P>
            <P>Dilution with 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water is indicated after 
              ingestion or prior to gastric lavage. After any seizure activity 
              is controlled, gastric lavage may be indicated.</P>
            <P>If necessary to prevent further absorption, activated charcoal 
              may be administered and followed by a cathartic.</P>
            <P>In symptomatic patients, either intravenous calcium disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
              acid or intramuscular dimercaprol should be given as soon as possible.</P>
            <P>D-Penicillamine may be given after initial treatment with dimercaprol. 
              Hemodialysis alone is not effective. </P>
            <P><I>2-Eye injuries&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>Treatment of eye injuries includes vigorous irrigation with normal 
              salin. Ophthalmologic referral is indicated for severe elemental 
              copper, copper chloride or copper cyanide plating bath injuries 
              to the eye.</P>
            <P><I>3-Metal fume fever&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>Treatment is symptomatic and removal from exposure may be sufficient.</P>
            <P><I>4-Dermatitis&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>Removal from exposure may be sufficient but application of topical 
              corticosteroid preparations may be required.</P>
            <P><I>5-Green hair&nbsp;:</I></P>
            <P>Green hair from exogenous copper can be treated effectively with 
              shampoos containing D-penicillamine.</P>
            <P><B>IV-Biological Monitoring&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>The normal concentration of copper in blood plasma is 1 mg/liter. 
            </P>
            <P>Ninety-five percent (95%) of the copper in plasma is in <I>ceruloplasmin</I> 
              but, it is one of the acute-phase reactant proteins and it increases 
              in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. It is elevated also 
              in patients taking estrogens and birth control pills and in those 
              who are pregnant or have cirrhosis, cancer, or thyrotoxicosis.</P>
            <P>Erythrocytes also contain a significant portion of the copper found 
              in blood in the form of an enzyme, superoxide dismutase.</P>
            <P>Increased serum concentrations of copper are found in individuals 
              with such liver diseases as primary cirrhosis and other cholestatic 
              diseases.</P>
            <P>At air concentrations near current exposure limits, biological 
              monitoring is not warrented. Biological limit values cannot be established, 
              owing to lack of reliable exposure dose, and effect relationship.

              <B>V-Occupational, Environmental Regulations, and</b></P>
            <P><B> Dietary Recommendations&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P><B>A-Occupational&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>1-The VEMP in Quebec for copper dust and mist&nbsp;is&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>1mg/m3 expressed as copper</P>
            <P>2-The VEMP<B> </B>for copper fumes is&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>0.2mg/m3 expressed as copper.</P>
            <P><B>B-Environmental&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>The EPA (USA) has determined that lake and stream water should 
              contain no more than 1 ppm, and drinking water no more than 1.3 
              ppm.</P>
            <P><B>C-Dietary&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>The National Academy of Sciences (USA) recommends 2 to 3 mg of 
              copper per day as a safe and adequate intake for adults.</P>
            <P><B>VI-Environmental Fate and Transport&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper is found in the earths crust at approximately 70 ppm and 
              in sea water at 0.001 to 0.002 ppm. Mining and smelting are the 
              primary anthropogenic sources.</P>
            <P>Acidic soil conditions contribute to solubility and increased transport, 
              although appreciable mobilization occurs only at pH less than 3 
              in organic soils.</P>
            <P>Low pH and the passage of soft water through copper pipes can produce 
              high levels in drinking water; however, only 1% of U.S. drinking 
              water samples exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys 
              standard.</P>
            <P><B>VII-Environmental and Occupational Monitoring&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper fume and dust levels should be measured to ensure compliance 
              with local standards.</P>
            <P>Remonitoring should be performed after any changes in work practices 
              or plant processes that could cause a rise in air concentrations.</P>
            <P>For patients suspected of having non-occupational overexposure 
              to copper, an environmental investigation should be conducted including&nbsp;measuring 
              copper&nbsp;:</P>
            <P>-in drinking water, </P>
            <P><B>-</b>in non-prescription remedies and supplements,</P>
            <P>and investigating dietary practices such as drinking acidic beverages 
              fron copper-containing vessels.</P>
            <P>Contact dermatitis due to copper is rare. However, its occurrence 
              can be substantiated by careful patch testing. Exzematous dermatitis 
              and urticaria have been associated with the use of copper intrauterine 
              devices.</P>
            <P>Greenish discoloration of the hair has been seen in blond or lightly 
              pigmented individuals exposed to copper dust or copper-tainted water 
              used for shampooing or swimming.</P>
            <P><B>VIII-Prevention&nbsp;:</B></P>
            <P>Copper compounds used by potters are not considered much hazardous.</P>
            <P>In glazes, copper enhances lead leaching.</P>
            <P>Good studio housekeeping is always good practice. Avoidance of 
              processes</P>
            <P>generating unnecessary dust is also important and the wearing of 
              an approved </P>
            <P>dust mask when the exposure seems hazardous is also good practice.</P>

            <P> Inhalation of copper dust and fume results in irritation of the 
              respiratory tract, ulceration and perforation of nasal septum, metallic 
              or sweet taste, and in some instances, discoloration of the skin 
              and hair.The inhalation of metal fumes produced at high temperature, 
              such as welding, may cause 'metal fume fever', an influenza-like(benign) 
              illness. 
            <P> Copper sulfate is also used in the whitewashing and leather industry.Toxicity 
              is primarily due to accidental and suicidal attempts, and results 
              in intravascular hemolysis, methemogloninemia, renal failure and 
              often death. Remember clinical liver disease due to copper is not 
              usually significant. High copper content in drinking water and food 
              may contribute to the development of severe liver damage in infants. 
            <P> Copper compounds used by potters are not considered hazardous 
              as well as for pottery users. Copper in glazes fluxed by lead compounds 
              will leach more lead. 
            <P> Good studio housekeeping is always good practice. Avoidance of 
              processes generating unnecessary dust is also important and the 
              wearing of an approved dust mask when the exposure seems hazardous 
              is also good practice.
