            <p> <b>Natural Gas vs L.P. Gas</b><i>Natural gas kilns will easily 
            reach stoneware temperatures</i><br>
            Theoretical flame temperatures between these gasses are actually similar 
            but this is not the important point in this case. The heating value 
            of the gasses are different however, allowing more heat to be liberated 
            per volume of L.P. gas than natural gas. L.P. Gas has a heating value 
            of 95.5 MJ/m3 (2500 BTU/ft3) and natural gas liberates approx. 38 
            MJ/m3 (1000 BTU/ft3). All this really means is that we must ensure 
            that the burners, valves and the gas piping for natural gas firing 
            are sized to allow sufficient volume of gas to heat the kiln efficiently. 
            Luckily the costs of the gas are based on the heating value and not 
            the volume consumed. Although it depends on local pricing, generally 
            it is possible to obtain natural gas for about half the cost of bottled 
            gas. 
            <p> <i>Converting L.P. Gas Burners</i><br>
              To successfully modify existing L.P. Gas burners to operate on natural 
              gas, the gas pressure would need to be about the same. Usually the 
              town gas supply is reticulated at low pressure and it is therefore 
              not possible to convert the burners. Natural gas burners have larger 
              valves and burner parts to enable sufficient heat to be liberated. 
              If the gas pressures are the same, a simple jet size change should 
              be sufficient. 
            <p> Matching Natural Gas Burners To Your Kiln<br>
              Generally for a given kiln volume we would use more natural gas 
              burners than L.P. Gas burners to obtain the required heat input. 
              This can repay the owner with more even firings. Smaller kilns have 
              successful firings with a single burner provided a large preheat 
              pilot is fitted to assist with a low, steaming rate. 
            <p> <i>Advantages Of Natural Gas To L.P. Gas </i> 
            <ul>
              <li>Natural gas is "on tap". Consequently there are no worries about 
                empty or freezing gas cylinders or gas leaks during changeover. 
              <li>Natural gas is lighter than air and if a leak occurs the escaping 
                gas will rise, is rapidly diluted with air and easily dispersed. 
                In contrast L.P. Gas is heavier than air and tends to sink to 
                ground level, will accumulate and may cause an explosion. It is 
                important to treat all gasses with utmost caution. 
              <li>The burners are essentially large bunsen type units and if the 
                gas pressure is low are virtually noiseless in operation. Although 
                the venturi L.P. Gas burners are renowned as much quieter burners 
                than others, there is a noticeable difference with natural gas 
                burners. 
            </ul>
            <i>Disadvantages Of Natural Gas To L.P. Gas </i><br> <ul>
              <li>Natural gas burners are a little more difficult to adjust. As 
                the control valves need to be larger to handle the increased volume, 
                they tend to not have the same fine control available with the 
                needle type found on L.P. Gas burners. 
              <li>Natural gas burners are prone to "flash back" if not adjusted 
                correctly. This usually occurs if the primary air supply (the 
                adjustable wheel on the venturi section) is open too far or the 
                gas is turned down to a point where the flame speed exceeds the 
                escape velocity. Natural gas burners have a turn-down ratio (the 
                difference between maximum and minimum flame) of about 4:1. To 
                overcome this larger pilot burners are installed to provide a 
                separate low rate. 
              <li>It may be necessary to have the gas meter changed to a larger 
                unit. The gas authorities will usually do this free of charge 
                however you will have to pay for the pipe work to the kiln. Make 
                sure it is sized correctly by a competent person to minimise pressure 
                drop. 
              <li>It is important to ensure there is the proper ratio between 
                the gas and air (primary and secondary) supplied to the kiln to 
                obtain the most rapid temperature rise. This is more critical 
                for natural gas firing where the gas pressure is fixed. The correct 
                primary air is set by matching the burner tip with the air mixing 
                device. Secondary air is set by ensuring the area around the burner 
                tip is not excessive and the flue (chimney) is correctly sized 
                and has adequate draw. With L.P. Gas it is possible to simply 
                increase the gas pressure to obtain a temperature rise although 
                this can be wasteful of gas. 
              <li>Although not a disadvantage there are procedures that have to 
                be followed as natural gas installations are covered by a safety 
                code. It will be necessary to ensure the burners have approved 
                safety cut outs, a gas regulator and the chimney is of the correct 
                construction and has an approved terminal. The installation may 
                also be inspected by the local authorities but this will ensure 
                the burners operate correctly (and efficiently) and the kiln is 
                safe. 
                <p> Of course all of this is immaterial if you are lucky to be 
                  out in the countryside but unlucky to be miles away from the 
                  nearest Natural gas pipe.
