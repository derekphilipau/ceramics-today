<H3>Raku</H3>
Dateline: 04/14/97 
<p><img src="../images/r_gills.gif" width="37" height="50" align="left">aku originated 
  in Japan in the 16th century, where raku vessels were and still are used in 
  the traditional <A HREF="http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/teae.html"><B>tea 
  ceremony</b></a>. It is a low-fire technique, where bisqued work is quickly 
  heated to red hot temperature and then taken out of the kiln and reduced in 
  wood shavings, newspaper or a similar combustible material. Raku ware is decorated 
  with low-fire glazes, which usually contain a lot of frit. The clays used for 
  this firing technique contain a high percentage of grog, so the work will be 
  able to withstand the high temperature fluctuations, although this doesn't mean 
  that other clays can't be used. 
<P> Raku ware may be sculptural, like some of the work of William K. Turner, handbuilt 
  such as with Mitzi Morris, or wheel-thrown, like the works of Jack &amp; Cindy 
  Philips or Dave &amp; Boni Deal. 
<P> <img align=left src="../images/kiln.jpg">Angela Smiths work <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/2850/"><B>'The 
  Elements'</B></A> shows an interesting approach. She has represented the four 
  elements <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/2850/p_erth.html"><B>earth</B></A>, 
  <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/2850/p_aire.html"><B>air</B></A>, <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/2850/p_fyre.html"><B>fire</B></A> 
  and <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/2850/p_watr.html"><B>water</B></A> 
  in a raku context. 
<P> Raku, with its battle with the elements of fire and smoke is an exciting technique, 
  one that is suited to communal firings, as many dedicated workshops can testify. 
  While it is an age-old tradition from Japan, it has found many devout followers 
  in western ceramic communities.
