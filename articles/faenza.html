              &#8211; the International Competition of Contemporary Art, assessed 
              the entries. 
            <p><b>Their opinion</b>: 
            <p>&quot;The work <i>Silence I and II</i> has been considered worthy 
              of the first prize equally for the ability to condense an expression 
              of extreme simplicity into a material of great delicacy and thinness 
              and for the new effect of depth expressed by the successful contrast 
              between the outer surface and the inner void &quot;.

              ('Night in my district', by Anibal Troilo) has been considered worthy 
              of the first prize equally for the great formal and chromatic control 
              of its several plastic elements that come from a light-hearted interpretation 
              of the tradition and that reveal awareness and active participation 
              in the most recent artistic happenings&quot;.

            <p><b>History of the Award</b>
            <p>The International Competition of Contemporary Ceramic Art has marked 
              the cultural history of Faenza during 20th century, setting a worldwide 
              ceramic benchmark especially starting from 1960s. Established in 
              1932 with a regional extent on the initiative of the Museum of Faenza 
              and the sponsorship of E.N.A.P.I. (Ente Nazionale Artigianato e 
              Piccole Industrie), the Competition did not appeared as an independent 
              event, but on the contrary it was included in a set of initiatives 
              of fair-promotional character, also very different each other, that 
              Faenza had organised for some years under the name &#8220;Settimana 
              Faentina&#8221; (Faenza week). 
            <p>The Competition, from its very first editions, was not an extemporary 
              event: it came from the tradition of ceramics in Faenza and had 
              a basis in Gaetano Ballardini dictates. In fact, he successfully 
              decided to write down in the statute of the newborn Museum (1908) 
              &#8220;to hold international, periodical exhibitions of ceramics 
              combining both the two artistic sides: the technique and the practical 
              use&#8221; and in addition &#8220;to hold international competitions 
              for ceramic production from the artistic and technical viewpoints&#8221;.
            <p> In 1938 the Competition became national; it was the first time 
              that an event in this field was opened in Europe with a specific 
              character, a periodical pace and without trade purposes. 
            <p>The war-interlude interrupted the development of the Competition 
              in 1942 but it immediately resumed in 1946, continuing regularly 
              until now: yearly until 1987, biennial from 1989. In 1963 the Competition 
              was extended to an international level.
            <p> This Event has always been, since the beginning, an important 
              step in the improvement, in the renewal and in the promotion of 
              ceramics not only as far as the artistic and decorative aspect is 
              concerned but also regarding the functional and furnishing viewpoint. 
              In addition, it boosted a complex research, both aesthetic and linked 
              to experiences in the field of technology of clay, of glazes, of 
              firings borrowed from the industry and involving the industry itself 
              in the design of gift and fancy goods and of tiles.
            <p> Seen not only as a spur to traditional ceramics, but in particular 
              as an experience, often difficult, in order to come up to this material, 
              to mould it, to put it in aesthetic purposes, the Faenza Competition 
              allowed an interesting comparison with contemporary art and, in 
              particular in the last fifty years, witnessed an important involvement 
              with sculpture.<br>
              In the turn of 20th century, except from some leading personalities 
              such as Arturo Martini, the term of comparison of ceramics in Italy 
              was the painting, whereas in the more recent decades and in particular 
              from the Second World War the highest level term of comparison has 
              been the sculpture, which prevailed over any other art. The history 
              of Faenza Competition clearly mirrors this phenomenon and can be 
              considered an important reference for a stimulating phenomenal survey. 
            <p>In the Faenza Competition took part Italian artists &#8211; among 
              them: Angelo Biancini, Guido Gambone, Leoncillo Leonardi, Pietro 
              Melandri, Carlo Zauli &#8211; and foreigners &#8211; Eduard Chapallaz, 
              Sueharu Fukami &#8211; who made not only the history of ceramics 
              of 20th century, but also the one of sculpture and of painting, 
              with primary aspects concerning the testing and the contamination 
              among several, and not exclusively, ceramic materials. This last 
              approach could be a source of unimaginable development towards new 
              perspectives.<br>
