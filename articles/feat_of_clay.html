              redolent of myth, mystery and majesty. Christie's Auction of Ceramics 
              at Hong Kong said everything about the power of perfection to the 
              tender process of achieving the subliminal essence in the firing 
              of age old techniques that seeked to capture the infinite in tenuous 
              dictums of technical virtuosity. </p>
            <p> To celebrate 20 years of their presence in Hong Kong Christie's 
              brought forth a collection of ceramic ware that exemplified history 
              and embraced nostalgia. From the word go it was all eyes on the 
              <b><a href="copper-red_vase.html">Early Ming under glaze Copper Red
              Vase</a></b> a great masterpiece of Hongwu porcelain. Every aspect 
              of its manufacture has been successful,' says Rosemary Scott senior 
              academic consultant at Christie's Asian departments, from being 
              thrown on the wheel, the choice and execution of its decoration 
              ,the application of its glaze, to its final firing', </p>
            <p>
              Finally after much speculation and feverish bidding this Ming Vase 
              went down to the hammer for an astounding HK$78,520,000, US$10,207,600.</p><p>
              For its pedigree and its persona this rare Yuhuchunping , Hongwu 
              Period (1368-1398) piece was sold to Mr. Steve Wynn, Chairman and 
              CEO of Wynn Resorts who has announced that he will be donating this 
              exceptional piece to a museum in Macau. ` In view of the importance 
              of this piece, we are particularly thrilled that it will be returning 
              to China where it can be enjoyed and appreciated by the maximum 
              number of students and art lovers' said Christie's.. The vase realized 
              HK$78,520,000, a world record price for Ming porcelain.

              What makes this piece a gem of purest ray serene? The use of copper 
              to produce red on high fired ceramics has from its first appearance 
              in the Tang dynasty provided a formidable challenge to the potter. 
              The process of producing the desired colour is so sensitive that 
              great care has to be taken with the composition of the base glaze, 
              the percentage of copper, the temperature and degree of reduction 
              in the firing and the placement of vessels within the kiln. In fact 
              research shows that the copper red decoration was discovered empirically 
              or by accident. This vase is undoubtedly is one of the finest examples 
              of under glaze porcelain to have been made during the Hongwu reign.`It 
              is remarkable that it has fired so perfectly and even more remarkable 
              that it has survived in excellent condition to the present day,' 
              says Scott. </p><p>
              Collectors in Hong Kong seemed to be excited to hear the news of 
              the new world record set by the Ming ware and soon they sat and 
              went back in time talking of the yesteryear. How Hong Kong's impending 
              change from British to Chinese Communist rule had led to an exodus 
              of Chinese art, with residents sending their collections overseas 
              out of fear that China may prevent the export of items deemed to 
              be cultural patrimony. </p><p>
              The second highest bidding in the ceramic and Imperial auction was 
              nabbed fairly and squarely by an extremely rare blue and white 'three 
              friends' jar, Guan, Yuan Dynasty, mid-14th century exquisitely painted 
              globular jar that went for HK$21,400,000, US$2,782,000.</p><p>
              It was imminently clear those transition periods that bridge the 
              abyss from one culture to another hold a special fascination to 
              our society. Chinese firing techniques changed according to tastes 
              and influences of rulers. Objects d'art of any size and significance 
              appeared to substantially have a link between the spread of an empire 
              and the formulation of a new culture.
            <p align="center"><a href="images/Christie's_auction/lot1384.jpg"><img src="images/christies_auction/thumbs/lot1384.jpg" width="132" height="180" border="0"></a><a href="images/Christie's_auction/lot1387.jpg"><img src="images/christies_auction/thumbs/lot1387.jpg" width="136" height="180" border="0"></a><a href="images/Christie's_auction/lot1295.jpg"><img src="images/christies_auction/thumbs/lot1295.jpg" width="132" height="180" border="0"></a></p>
              <br>
            The next highest bid was an important Ming blue and white jar, Guan, 
            Chenghua six-character mark within double-circles and of the period 
            (1465-1487) that sold for HK$16,920,000, US$2,199,600. 
            <p> Collectors and connoisseurs alike have revered the Chenghua reign 
              this jar was a product of greater refinement of raw materials and 
              better preparation. The fact that it had as little iron impurity 
              resulted in whiter body material. According to studies there was 
              also slight adjustment in the composition with the proportion of 
              clay to baidunzi (china stone) being increased so that so that there 
              was more alumina and less calcia to produce honey white body which 
              could be fired at a slightly higher temperature than previous porcelains 
              and was thus more vitrified. The glaze on this jar was improved 
              by reducing the amount of flux in the glaze which allow it to mature 
              at a higher temperature enabling more of the residual batch material 
              to be dissolved in the glaze during firing. This produced a smooth 
              glossy glaze with minute bubbles evenly distributed. This gives 
              the glaze its much admired unctuous jade like texture, while the 
              tiny bubbles produce a soft appearance without masking or distorting 
              any decorating beneath. A reduction in the amount of iron in the 
              glaze resulted in a cleaner clearer glaze. The persistence of colour 
              texture and style of painting of the cobalt blue is in keeping with 
              another feature of the Chenghua style. This jar reflected therein 
              the magic of Chinese Cobalt. </p><p>
              <a href="images/Christie's_auction/lot1238_hexagonal_Dragon_vase.jpg"><img src="images/christies_auction/thumbs/lot1238_hexagonal_Dragon_vase.jpg" alt="Hexagonal Dragon Vase" width="142" height="180" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
              sale proved to be the awakening of an ephemeral treasure trove, 
              with ceramic ware reflecting the prowess and aesthetics leanings 
              of varied dictums of dynasties. A superb Imperial blue and white 
              hexagonal 'Dragon' vase, Qianlong six-character sealmark and of 
              the period (1736-1795) went for HK$13,560,000, US$1,762,800.
            <p>Tall slender and hexagonal this painted entity with a full faced 
              dragon grasping a shou medallion above a brand of archaistic cicada 
              blades was a quaint piece that had embellished key frets and a tall 
              waisted neck with a shou character between archaistic foliate dragon 
              motifs above and below. What stood out in this piece was not only 
              its novelty of form but the brilliance of the cobalt blue. </p><p>
              With a fantastic collection of an amazing number of ceramics on 
              sale this auction was also about learning about different genres 
              in the Chinese period of porcelain and clay firing. During some 
              periods, the Chinese porcelain maker's art attained a complexity 
              that mirrors the conflicting influences at work. The aesthetics 
              of the Song dynasty preceding the Yuan rulers had been about daintiness 
              of form, hue and pattern. The Mongol domination, which extended 
              over China and the Iranian world, signaled the end of the Song ideal 
              in the Chinese art of the object. Palace wares became huge, the 
              colors intense and contrasted and patterns crisply arrayed and outlined. 
              The Yuan wares reveal from Day One a cultural revolution which the 
              Ming who overthrew them nevertheless perpetuated. </p><p>
              Even the porcelains that supposedly maintained earlier tradition 
              reveal a change of sensibility. There were some ravishing bottles 
              of so-called pear shape more heavily potted and the pale greenish 
              (qingbai) glaze, much loved in Song times. The radical change of 
              orientation came out most strikingly in entirely new categories. 
              </p><p>
              The contrasting tonalities and the sculptural handling of the dragons 
              and the frets made the sale have a vigor that was rare to see. </p><p>
              The most spectacular expression of the aesthetic revolution was 
              the blue-and-white porcelain and this sale reflected the fact that 
              Ming porcelain makers were boldly innovative across the border. 
              In the early 15th century, they used copper oxide to produce the 
              first red-glazed ceramics. Some are monochrome; others are decorated 
              with dragons reserved in white on the outer sides. From rounded 
              shoulders to waisted necks to flared mouths and penciled styles 
              this auction that celebrated 20 years of Christie's in Hong Kong 
              became an exercise in the patronage of ceramic arts that flourished 
              well before our modern times.
