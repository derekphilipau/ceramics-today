              </b><font size="-2">Please note: this article may be offensive to 
              some readers.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><b><a href="images/rascal_ware/rascal_jan_2007b.jpg"><img src="images/rascal_ware/thumbs/rascal_jan_2007b.jpg" alt="Rascal Ware" width="334" height="299" border="0"></a></b></p>
            <p>Michio Fujiwara was a celebrated potter in the city of Hiroshima, 
              Japan. As an apprentice, he learned the potter&#8217;s art in the 
              early 1920s. Over the years he became especially well-known for 
              his yunomis and tea ceremony ceramics. </p>
            <p>Michio&#8217;s son, Ichiro Fujiwara, was born in 1921. He served 
              his country as a much decorated pilot in the Japanese Imperial Navy. 
              On December 7, 1941, the youthful Ichiro lead the first air wing 
              attack on Pearl Harbor. Later in the war, in a furious air and sea 
              battle against the American fleet, he was credited with inflicting 
              heavy damage on the USS Missouri. Ichiro would survive World War 
              II and had planned to open a teahouse/restaurant in peacetime. An 
              important feature of this venture would include his father&#8217;s 
              very famous yunomis. But in an ironic turn of unintended consequences, 
              that was not to be.</p>
            <p>Michio continued to operate his pottery throughout the war and 
              his fame as a yunomi maker increased, even during those difficult 
              times. In 1945, on the afternoon of August the 5th, Michio was loading 
              his kiln with the intention of a glaze firing the next day. He preheated 
              all night and by early morning the kiln and its 800 yunomis were 
              sufficiently warm to proceed. </p>
            <p>At the next moment, Hiroshima was introduced into the nuclear age 
              and these tea cups -- and the rest of the city -- reached the necessary 
              cone 10 temperature in approximately 6 seconds. The cup shown here 
              is the lone survivor of that firing. It reveals the marks of uranium 
              fusion and remains metaphorically radioactive to this day. It is 
              not recommended for daily use but certainly qualifies as a &#8220;cautionary 
              object&#8221; and, as such, a Rascal Ware Original. To the best 
              of our knowledge, there is no other like it in the world. In a turn 
              on the Biblical prophesy, this is a case of the sins of the son 
              being visited upon the father. It was President Harry Truman who 
              ordered the dropping of the first atomic bomb. Truman was from Missouri. 
              What goes around comes around. <br>
