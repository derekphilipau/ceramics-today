                  <p align="left">Domestic pots have gone hand in hand with human 
                    civilization. What does hand made functional ware bring into 
                    our lives that a cheap, useful, factory-made bowl from Woolworths 
                    doesn't? This question strikes at the heart of our capitalist 
                    society where convenience and conformity have become goals 
                    and &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; has replaced life. In this world 
                    the fast food equivalent of pottery has led to a bulimic gorging 
                    where a smorgasbord (so to speak) of faddish dishes in the 
                    latest colors and &#8220;contemporary&#8221; shapes have replaced 
                    meaningful objects; functional pots made by potters bringing 
                    the concerns of the domestic world into direct contact with 
                    the concerns of the artistic world.</p>
                  <p align="left"><a href="images/shannon_garson1.jpg"><img src="images/shannon_garson1_sm.jpg" alt="Porcelain bowls by Shannon Garson" width="256" height="182" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
                    privilege of using handmade pots is that they contain the 
                    idea of human endeavor, a link with other people not with 
                    factories or corporations. Most people haven&#8217;t lost 
                    touch with this concept when it comes to food. A home cooked 
                    meal is still the epitome of good, nourishing food for the 
                    body and soul. But society as a whole has lost contact with 
                    the fact that pots can do the same thing. By only buying useful 
                    and fashionable pots from Ikea we lose touch with something 
                    in ourselves, in the same way as if we eat at MacDonald&#8217;s 
                    every night. We begin to feel that everything should be blatant, 
                    the main reason for eating or owning pots is immediate gratification. 
                    We forget that there is value in taking time to appreciate 
                    things and what is left is a jaded palate and a yearning to 
                    eat / buy everything with a hunger for nothing.</p>
                  <p align="left">I want to consider two aspects of functional 
                    ware in the 21st century. The first is how potting enriches 
                    the life of the maker and the second is how handmade pots 
                    enrich the life of the user. A quote from Canadian potter, 
                    Brother Thomas Bezanson illustrates this concept. Brother 
                    Thomas speaks of the artist&#8217;s experience as being a 
                    &quot;vision quest&quot; and the creation of art as providing 
                    a link between the world of the mundane and the world of the 
                    spirit, he says &quot;Artist's experience opens their own 
                    hearts to a larger reality and their work opens ours.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    It is my contention that, although useful, cheap, factory 
                    made pots are readily available, handmade domestic ware builds 
                    on a tradition of human/pot interaction that is as relevant 
                    to the 21st century as it was to the 1st. </p>
                  <p align="left">The value that these pots bring into our lives 
                    has changed from being pure necessity, when the town potter 
                    was as essential as the baker or the farrier to handmade pots 
                    performing a spiritual function. The presence of handmade 
                    domestic ware has become a symbol of the link between artist 
                    and community, the importance of a skill that takes time to 
                    learn, a calm, individual voice amid the mass-produced. In 
                    this world of fast food, and corporate control of &#8220;good 
                    taste &#8220; in everything from clothing to home wares the 
                    handmade pot represents an investment in individualism, an 
                    aesthetic that values patience and celebrates humanity in 
                    objects. </p>
                  <p align="left">The availability of factory made ware has led 
                    to a gradual and insidious &#8220;de-texurization&#8221; of 
                    the home. The uniformity and smoothness of factory made pots 
                    and other domestic objects is beautiful in itself and these 
                    objects of design and manufacturing processes function as 
                    doorways to ideas, but these are not the same ideas as the 
                    ideas in a handmade pot. The products of factories can bring 
                    up ideas about the design, the manufacturing process, the 
                    role of human imagination in an industrial world. Handmade 
                    pots can bring up ideas of process, the role of the artist, 
                    and human skill, and how it is transformed by creativity. 
                    The connection between the human and the object, in a handmade 
                    pot is so strong that the very word &#8220;hand-made&#8221; 
                    has come to signify a fanciful, stereotype and, as with Sara 
                    Lee &#8220;home baked&#8221; apple pies is often applied to 
                    things which are not hand-made at all. Companies that peddle 
                    lifestyle such as Country Road and Ikea are aware of the individual 
                    appeal of the hand-made and often include factory made items 
                    designed to reference the hand made. These items may include 
                    texture, or in the case of pottery (horror of horrors!!!) 
                    fake throwing lines. To engage with the many concepts objects 
                    bring into domestic life there must be balance, the industry 
                    of making beautiful things accessible through mass reproduction 
                    can exist side by side with the industry of creative individuals 
                    making pots alone in the studio.</p>
                  <p align="left">Individuals creating objects to be used in the 
                    domestic context are integral to a fully rounded society. 
                    The studio potter combining skill, intellect and spirit in 
                    their works is more than a happy artist doing what they love. 
                    Like the pots themselves this individual embodies a greater 
                    idea, the notion that there is a link between everyday life 
                    and spiritual fulfillment the possibility of a world where 
                    objects are meaningful, beyond the vagaries of fashion and 
                    commerce. I think through it's very functionality domestic 
                    ware can slip in where other examples of &quot;art&quot; would 
                    not be welcome. Pots can do this in a very important way, 
                    in the intimate space of the home. Walter Keeler spoke about 
                    this at a conference on &#8220;Form and Function&#8221; in 
                    London last year claiming that functional ware within the 
                    home &quot;speaks&quot; a language that is deeply connected 
                    to the experiential. Keeler explores the notion that pots 
                    escape from the boundaries of visual art through their use 
                    and as a consequence &quot;the experimental language of functional 
                    ceramics can chatter away to us&quot;. The language of handmade 
                    pots within the home is a complex one. Every time we put a 
                    cup or bowl to use we are initiating a series of ideas connecting 
                    artists to the home.</p>
                  <p align="left"> Unlike other forms of original art such as 
                    painting and sculpture handmade pottery has been able to enter 
                    homes regardless of socio-economic status or level of education. 
                    It is an art form that can be non-threatening and I see this 
                    as one of the most valuable aspects of handmade pots. Although 
                    many handmade pots end up in the back of the pantry gathering 
                    dust- the relics of anniversaries long gone, many others are 
                    in constant daily use. The practicality of these pots opens 
                    the possibility of connection between the world of ideas and 
                    the world of making the meals/ doing the dishes. Food symbolizes 
                    many things in our lives and Nana&#8217;s milk jug or favorite 
                    teacup becomes a part of the love and rituals of communication 
                    in these relationships. Bridges can be mended (or broken!) 
                    over a cup of tea, asking someone over for a meal or up for 
                    a cup of coffee is an entrenched part of the courting ritual. 
                    Later down the track there is nothing like the satisfying 
                    crash of a piece of china smashing against a wall to illustrate 
                    your point. What other form of art is so intimately involved 
                    in the minutiae of life? </p>
                  <p align="left">The connection between the maker and the user 
                    is one of the most valuable, and joyful aspects of my work 
                    as a potter. Creating work that enters daily life and has 
                    the possibility of comforting someone when they feel sad or 
                    lonely, being part of their morning daydreams or nightly ritual, 
                    is a great honor not shared by all artists. The very fact 
                    that handmade pots are not quite the stuff of &#8220;cutting 
                    edge&#8221; exhibitions is their greatest strength. It has 
                    been said that making handmade functional pots represents 
                    the conservative side of ceramic art but what could be more 
                    radical than entering the home, and affecting the inhabitants 
                    on a regular basis?</p>
                  <p align="left"><img src="images/shannon_garson2_sm.jpg" alt="Porcelain bowls by Shannon Garson" width="250" height="145" align="left">Where 
                    handmade pots come into their full strength is in the fact 
                    that intimate relationships are joined by a third, more nebulous 
                    party. Where handmade pots are invited to tea the artist or 
                    rather the idea of the artist is also invited. The knowledge 
                    that the bowl or jug you are using has been crafted by another 
                    human being brings individuals into contact with one another. 
                    This creates a community of potters/artists and users. Where 
                    in the past the pot would most likely have been made by a 
                    local person using local materials and working within the 
                    immediate geographic locale, handmade pots now travel far 
                    and wide disseminating their strange mixture of signs and 
                    symbols miles from where the clay was first mined. Since the 
                    first wondrous porcelain made its way out of China handmade 
                    pots have carried with them portents and echoes of other lives. 
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"> If we were to &#8220;read&#8221; a handmade 
                    domestic pot as scholars read texts we would find that this 
                    useful object symbolizes much more than what its function 
                    might suggest. In this reading the knowledge that the pot 
                    is indeed handmade and not the clever product of some machine 
                    is the most important concept. It is implicit in this pot 
                    that it is the product of meaningful work, the outcome of 
                    a series of creative decisions bounded by the functional form 
                    and the limits of the clay. We are all products of our environment 
                    and every thumbprint on a blob of clay is a record of that. 
                    The line of a thrown bowl says as clearly as our handwriting 
                    who we are and what we are about. Handmade pots also encompass 
                    the idea of beauty. While most potters would deny that their 
                    work ever reaches that perfect balance of form and function 
                    where the glaze, function and spirit of the pot appears effortless 
                    and seamlessly combined, most potters eagerly and fearfully 
                    open the kiln, mentally crossing their fingers and praying 
                    that there will be just one magnificent pot. Handmade pots, 
                    ranging from the first, imperfect wobbly efforts through to 
                    the work of accomplished craftspeople strive for beauty and 
                    it is in their striving that they connect us to one another. 
                    Joan Chittister in her wonderful essay &#8220;Thirst For Beauty 
                    Thirst For Soul&#8221; speaks about the role of the artist 
                    in bringing beauty into our lives;<br>
                    &#8220;Beauty, in other words, lifts life out of the anaesthetizing 
                    effects of the pedestrian and gives us reason for going on, 
                    for being, for ranging beyond our boundaries, for endeavoring 
                    always to be more than we are. It enables us to pause in time 
                    long enough to remember that some things are worth striving 
                    for, that some things are worth doing over and over again 
                    until they become their breathless selves... Beauty is a moment 
                    in time that must be captured so that the human heart can, 
                    in the midst of pain and despair, cling to the notion that 
                    that which is capable of bearing beauty is capable of bringing 
                    new life, is capable of pervading the world, is able by penetrating 
                    our own souls to penetrate the ugliness of a world awash in 
                    the cheap, the tawdry, the imitative, the excessive and the 
                    cruel.&#8221; (pp.11-12 Creation Out of Clay, Wm B. Eerdmans 
                    Publishing Co, 1999) <br>
                    Chittister believes that the artist can bring this element 
                    into our lives and this essay was written about a potter- 
                    Brother Thomas. If, as Chittister writes our lives are awash 
                    in cheap, tawdry imitations then it is our homes and immediate 
                    surroundings that are affected. While the beautiful, thought-provoking 
                    contents of art galleries may provide illumination and inspiration; 
                    in the midst of domestic isolation and over-work one is more 
                    likely to come across the cup of tea or bowl of salad.</p>
                  <p align="left"><br>
                    The work of being a potter, learning skills, translating them 
                    into objects of beauty and utility, focuses our minds. The 
                    repetition in the studio and rhythm of the firing schedule 
                    all form a solid background to the unpredictability disastrous 
                    and beautiful of the finished product. Work is an individual 
                    thing and I can only speak of what working as a potter has 
                    given me, and my hopes for work in the future. The most important 
                    thing I learnt in my early years of potting was patience. 
                    Not waiting for pots to dry was the cause of many an early 
                    failure, trying to unpack, glaze and pack a kiln all on the 
                    same day another one. Unlike drawing and painting, my previous 
                    areas of study, where the materials were torn, and manipulated 
                    in various violent ways for immediate effect here was clay, 
                    a material that bossed me around. And glaze a mysterious wet 
                    substance that I crossed my fingers and hoped like hell would 
                    do what it was supposed to. These materials rewarded me not 
                    with obedience but with unpredictability, and gradually I 
                    learnt to relax and respect the natural rhythms and I grew 
                    to love being bossed by my materials and working with them 
                    rather than trying to subdue them. Potters throughout the 
                    ages have worked in the same way and after years of the rhythm 
                    of the work sometimes, the work is elevated into something 
                    more than itself, what used to just be a serviceable salad 
                    bowl now functions as a sculpture. How can we define this 
                    quality that turns work from mundane into transcendental? 
                    We can&#8217;t define it, it is like beauty, the secret spice 
                    of life that brings other flavors into balance, we don&#8217;t 
                    know what it is but we know when we see it.</p>
