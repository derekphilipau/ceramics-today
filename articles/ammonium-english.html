                <P>Ammonia-dissolved pre-vulcanized latex is of everyday usage to make flexible 
                  moulds and peelable protections. In this last case, it is mainly 
                  used in ceramic decoration, to carry out resists in the application 
                  of engobes, glazes or colorants.
                <P>The liquid latex solution is applied with a brush to the dry 
                  area to protect for less than 15 minutes, then becomes rubbery. 
                  After application and drying of a layer of engobe, colorant 
                  or glaze, one withdraws the solidified latex film by gently 
                  separating it from the ceramic object with a pair of small pliers 
                  or a blade. The elasticity of latex facilitates the removal 
                  and generally the pieces are withdrawn as a whole and in one 
                  go. The parts protected by latex are free of engobe, colorant 
                  or glaze. 
                <P>This technique is particularly appreciated when products of 
                  very different colors must be superimposed while being well 
                  delimited, or if the color of the ceramic object or shard must 
                  appear non-colored in the case of application by spraying or 
                  dipping. 
                <P>Attention - if the porosity of the object is too important 
                  the layer of latex will be difficult to withdraw. Always make 
                  a test before launching into it. 
                <P>It is necessary to proceed in a well ventilated room to avoid 
                  breathing ammonia vapor. In the case of a daily and long use 
                  of this technique, it will be necessary to consider means of 
                  suitable protection and ventilation. Brushes must be washed 
                  between each application and drying of latex. <FONT COLOR="#004080"></FONT> 
                  <FONT COLOR="#004080">[Editor's note: in my experience, latex 
                  brushes cannot be properly washed. They should only be used 
                  for that purpose.] </FONT>

                <P ALIGN=left><font size="-2">Gary Molitor made the following 
                  observations in regards to using Liquid latex resist: &quot;The 
                  product ceramists should be using is prevulcanised liquid latex 
                  rubber (e.g. Douglas &amp; Sturgess's &quot;LATEX NUMBER 10 
                  WHITE&quot; - <a href="http://artstuf.com/flexmold.html" target="_blank">http://artstuf.com/flexmold.html</a>). 
                  This product has a very light odor. I use this same material 
                  in my work. Also, I work for a paint manufacturer where we make 
                  latex paint.<br>
                  Ammonia is used to stabilize the pH. Breathing pure ammonia 
                  is quite harmful and our guys wear chemical respirators as a 
                  safety precaution. However, the amount of ammonia one breathes 
                  as a result of using small amounts of latex rubber is very small.&quot;</font></P>

                </p>
                <p>Ammonia is used mainly in the manufacture of fertilizers and 
                  of many other products in a very large variety of fields. It 
                  is used as a cooling gas in the industry of industrial refrigeration. 
                  One can also find it as a cooling gas in arenas, and as an air 
                  contaminant in breeding settings (examples: pigsties, henhouses). 
                  Ammonia is also found as liquid ammonia which is in fact gaseous 
                  ammonia dissolved in water (solution of ammonia at 28% or ammonia 
                  at 28%). </p>
                <p><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Hygiene and Safety:</FONT></B></p>
                <p><B>I-Appearance:</B> Ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic 
                  and prickly odor. It is a suffocating gas at high concentration.</p>
                <p><B>II-Exposure Characteristics:</B> Exposure to ammonia in 
                  the work environment occurs mainly as a gas, because of its 
                  very low boiling point and its great volatility. The exposure 
                  to liquefied ammonia generates a significant gas concentration 
                  because of its very low boiling point and its high volatility. 
                  The exposure to liquefied ammonia is increasingly frequent because 
                  of its use in refrigeration systems. Moreover, concentrated 
                  aqueous ammonia solutions can emit ammonia vapors at high levels 
                  of concentration. </p>
                <p><B>III-Exposure to the gas: </B> The prickly odor characteristic 
                  of ammonia can be detected at 16,7 ppm, which is in the same 
                  order of magnitude as the VEMP, 25 ppm or 17 mg/m&#179;; at 
                  a VECD of 35 ppm or 24 mg/m&#179;; at an IDLH value of 300 ppm 
                  or 209 mg/m&#179; and at the lower limit of explosiveness at 
                  13 % or 13 000 ppm; so that it can be a sign of adequate warning 
                  before the exposure becomes dangerous. An olfactive fatigue 
                  occurs following repeated exposures, therefore the odor cannot 
                  be an adequate sign of warning to an exposure exceeding the 
                  VEMP or the VECD. However, the olfactive threshold is sufficiently 
                  low to prevent a situation of IDLH. </p>
                <p><B>IV-Exposure to the liquid: </B> Ammonia is a liquid at -33,35&#176;C. 
                  In the liquid state, it is thus necessary to take into account 
                  all the aspects which comprise the exposure to a liquid at low 
                  temperature. Immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH): 
                  300 ppm </p>
                <p><B>V-Inflammability and explosiveness: </B> <U>A-Inflammability:</U> 
                  The fire hazard caused by ammonia is relatively low, it must 
                  be put in contact with materials or a surface having a temperature 
                  of 651&#176;C before igniting itself However the presence of 
                  oil or other combustible materials can increase the fire hazard 
                  by lowering this temperature of autoignition. Ammonia can ignite 
                  in contact with strong oxidants. <U>B-Explosiveness:</U> Ammonia 
                  requires a concentration of at least 15% and the presence of 
                  a source of ignition to explode. Ammonia can explode in contact 
                  with strong oxidants.</p>
                <p><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Toxicology:</FONT></B> </p>
                <p><B>I-Toxicokinetics: </B> <U>A-Absorbtion</U> Ammonia is mainly 
                  absorbed by the respiratory tract. Absorption by other routes 
                  is negligeable. Du ring a short-time exposure (up to 2 minutes) 
                  at concentrations varying between 57 and 500 ppm, 83 &agrave; 
                  92 % of the inhaled dose is retained in the respiratory tract 
                  (mouth, lungs, etc.), among volunteers. Following longer exposures 
                  (30 minutes) among seven (7) volunteers exposed at 500 ppm, 
                  it has been reported that the retention of ammonia in the mucous 
                  membranes of the nasopharynx diminishes to 23 % when equilibrium 
                  is achieved (after10 &agrave; 27 minutes). <U>B-Distribution:</U> 
                  The few data available in man suggest that only small amounts 
                  are absorbed into the blood circulation. Blood ammonia is distributed 
                  throughout the body where it plays an important role the synthesis 
                  of proteins and in maintaining the acid-base equilibrium. <U>C-Metabolism:</U> 
                  Ammonia is an essential constituent of the human body. It is 
                  produced during digestion and rapidly metabolized into glutamine 
                  and urea, mainly by the liver. <U>D-Excretion:</U> The major 
                  part of ammonia (70-80%) dissolved in the mucous membranes of 
                  the upper respiratory tract was excreted unchanged in the expired 
                  air following inhalation at 500 ppm during 10 to 27 minutes 
                  by volunteers. Ammonia absorbed by the body is excreted by the 
                  kidneys as urea and ammonia compounds. Less than 1% of the 4 
                  grams of ammonia produced daily by the intestinal tract is excreted 
                  in the feces. A certain amount may also be excreted in sweat. 
                </p>
                <p><B>II-Acute Effects:</B> Irritation and corrosion:Ammonia being 
                  absorbed very little by the body, its effects are limited to 
                  its irritating and corroding capacity to the eyes, the skin 
                  and the respiratory tract. Ammonia as a gas is irritating and 
                  corrosive to the skin, the eyes and the higher respiratory tract 
                  (nose and throat). The severity of symptoms may vary according 
                  to the conditions of exposure (duration of contact, concentration 
                  of the product, etc). The first signs of exposure are discomfort, 
                  dry nose, watering and a burning sensation in the eyes. Exposure 
                  to high concentrations may cause irritation of the skin, damage 
                  to the cornea, cough, pain in the chest, respiratory problems 
                  (dyspnea i.e. shortness of breath) and suffocation. In severe 
                  cases, one observes laryngeal oedema which may evolve to pulmonary 
                  oedema and death by asphyxiation. The symptoms of pulmonary 
                  oedema (mainly cough and other respiratory difficulties) often 
                  appear after a delay which may go up to 48 hours. Physical exertion 
                  may worsen these symptoms. Rest and medical surveillance are 
                  consequently essential. Accidental exposure to high concentrations 
                  can also cause a bronchial irritation syndrome (RADS, Reactive 
                  Airways Dysfunction Syndrome, an asthma-like condition or asthma 
                  without a latency period). Very high concentrations may lead 
                  to corrosion of the skin, eyes and upper respiratory tract. 
                  Contact with liquefied ammonia gas can cause frostbites as well 
                  as corrosion of the eyes and the skin, following a direct contact.

                <p><B>IV-Chronic effects : </B>  Repeated or prolonged exposure 
                  can generate a certain tolerance, i.e. the irritating odor and 
                  effects will be felt at higher concentrations. </p>
                <p><B>V-Sensitization :</B> Available data do not show that ammonia 
                  can cause cutaneous or respiratory sensitization Justification 
                  of effects : Some reports mention cutaneous eruption (urticaria) 
                  following exposure to the vapors of ammonia and asthma-like 
                  reactions following exposure to concentrations between 8 to 
                  15 ppm of ammonia. However, these reports do not make it possible 
                  to link these effects with a mechanism of allergic nature. </p>
                <p><B>VI-Effects on development : </B> No data concerning an effect 
                  on the development was found in the consulted documentary sources 
                  Justification of effects : Ammonia is produced by the body. 
                  It is also an essential constituent for the normal development 
                  of human beings. An exposure in the work environment is not 
                  very likely to lead to an increase in the blood ammonia level 
                  and thus, it does not represent a hazard to development. </p>
                <p><B>VII-Effects on reproduction :</B> No data concerning the 
                  effects on reproduction was found in the consulted documentary 
                  sources. Justification of effects : Ammonia is normally produced 
                  by the body. It is also an essential constituent for the normal 
                  development of human beings. An exposure in the work environment 
                  is not very likely to lead to an increase in the blood ammonia 
                  level and thus, it does not represent a hazard for reproduction. 
                </p>
                <p><B>VIII-Effects on breast milk : </B> It is detected in human 
                  mother's milk. Justification of effects : Ammonia is a natural 
                  component of this milk. </p>
                <p><B>IX-Cancinogenic effects :</B> There was no data concerning 
                  a carcinogenic effect found in the consulted documentary sources. 
                </p>
                <p><B>X-Mutagenic effects :</B> The data do not make it possible 
                  to make an adequate evaluation of the mutagenic effect. Justification 
                  of effects : A study mentions a light increase in chromosomal 
                  aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in workers of a manufacture 
                  of artificial fertilizers simultaneously exposed to several 
                  chemicals among which ammonia. </p>
                <p><B><FONT SIZE="+1">First Aid : </FONT></B> </p>
                <p><B>I-Inhalation :</B> In the event of inhalation of gas, bring 
                  the worker in a ventilated place and place him in semi-seated 
                  position. If he does not breathe, give him artificial respiration. 
                  In the event of respiratory difficulties, give him oxygen. Transfer 
                  immediately him to the nearest medical emergency department. 
                  The symptoms of pulmonary oedema may appear after a delay of 
                  several hours and are worsened by physical exertion. Rest and 
                  medical supervision are consequently essential. </p>
                <p><B>II-Contact with eyes :</B> Rinse the eyes copiously with 
                  water for at least 20 minutes. See a doctor. </p>
                <p><B>III-Contact with skin :</B> Quickly withdraw contaminated 
                  clothing by using suitable gloves. Abundantly rinse skin with 
                  water. See a doctor. In the event of a frostbite, apply lukewarm 
                  water, rinse abundantly and see a doctor. </p>
                <p><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Prevention :</FONT></B> When engineering 
                  measures and modifications of working methods are not sufficient 
                  enough to reduce the exposure to this chemical, the wearing 
                  of individual protection equipment may be necessary. These protection 
                  gears must be in conformity with regulation. <U>I-Respiratory 
                  tract : </U> Wear a respiratory protection apparatus if the 
                  concentration in the work environment is higher than VEMP (25 
                  ppm or 17 mg/m&#179;) or than the VECD (35 ppm or 24 mg/m&#179;). 
                  <U>II-Skin :</U> Wear skin protection. The selection of skin 
                  protection equipment depends on the nature of the work to be 
                  carried out. <U>III-Eyes :</U> Wear protection for the eyes 
                  if there is a risk of splashes. The selection of ocular protection 
                  depends on the nature of the work to carry out and, if it is 
                  necessary, on the type of apparatus of respiratory protection 
                  used. <I>References :</I> <I>1-CSST-Quebec, Repertoire Toxicologique,
