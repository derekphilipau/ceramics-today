      <P><b>1st World Ceramic Biennale, 2001 Korea</b>
      <P>Please Note: links no longer valid! 
      <p>What 
        could be more befitting for the first article of the new millennium than 
        to write about the 1st World Biennale of Ceramics (CEBIKO), 2001 Korea? 
        This Biennale is hosted by the 'World Ceramic Exposition 2001 Korea Organizing 
        Committee', is sponsored by the Kyonggi Provincial Government of the Republic 
        of (South) Korea and is patronized by the <a href="http://www.karaart.com/academy/academie_gb.html"><b>International 
        Academy of Ceramic Arts</b></a> (IAC), the <a href="http://nceca.net/"><b>National 
        Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts</b></a> (NCECA) and the <a href="http://www.acers.org/"><b>American 
        Ceramic Society</b></a> (ACerS). 
      <p><img src="../images/wocekmascot.gif" width="111" height="77" align="left" alt="Toya, WOCWEK's mascot" border="0">The 
        <b>World Ceramic Exposition (WOCEK)</b>, an 'international non-profit, 
        cultural festival for the new millennium, celebrating the past, present 
        and future of ceramic arts', will be held in the Korean cities of Ichon, 
        Yoju, Kwangju, all brimming with age-long traditions in ceramics, from 
        August 10 to October 28, 2001. The theme of the event is &quot;Shaping 
        the Future with Earth&quot;. The Biennale will be WOCEK's main event, 
        but <b>other events</b> such as national exhibitions and conferences and 
        an <b>International Ceramic Symposium</b> will also be taking place. All 
        of this is promising to be a great show. 
      <p> The 1st World Biennale of Ceramics, 2001 Korea is the main event and 
        is an international ceramics competition of giant proportions. Open to 
        all individual and groups, regardless of nationality or age. The competition 
        offers a 'Grand Prix' of about US$27,000 (30 million Won), to be chosen 
        from the two categories of functional and non-functional ceramics. Furthermore 
        there is a 'Gold' prize of $US9,000 for each of the two above categories, 
        as well as a total of four silver (US$4,500) and eight bronze prizes (US$2,700) 
        to be won. Furthermore there will be 16 special mentions worth US$1,800 
        and multiple selected honorary 'diplomas' to be awarded. 
      <p><a name="sites"></a>The jury for this prize will consist of five jurors 
        -- three international and two Korean. Preliminary selection should be 
        completed by February 22, 2001 and all entries must be submitted to the 
        panel by February 10, 2001. The initial selection is by slides, identical 
        to the works to be exhibited. Up to five works may be submitted by any 
        one individual or group, and two slides of each work should be sent. Entry 
        forms for the competition may be downloaded from the Biennale websites 
        at <b>http://www.worldceramic.or.kr</b> or <b>http://www.ceramicbiennale.org</b>. 
        Further information can also be obtained by phone (+81-331-237 4291), 
        fax (+82-331-237 4295) and email: <b>c6@worldceramic.or.kr</b>. For reference, 
        a <b>copy of the entry form</b> (96 kb) is also available from Ceramics 
        Today, if the web sites should prove to be difficult to access. However, 
        this copy is not meant to replace getting further information from the 
        above mentioned sources... By the way -- good news for international participants: 
        there is no entry fee.
