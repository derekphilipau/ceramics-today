              <BR>
              </FONT>The ceramics student is left feeling like a second class 
              citizen, because the rich history, which he should be able to draw 
              upon for sustenance and inspiration, is not valued within the institution. 
              Hell, mostly it’s not even taught. Ask many ceramics lecturers who 
              Ernest Chaplet or Auguste Delaherche are and they won’t have a clue, 
              but mention a French post structuralist philosopher with absolutely 
              no interest in pottery at all...<BR>
              <BR>
              That this is a loss not only to Troy, but also to the painting student, 
              is not even considered.<BR>
              <BR>
              In this situation, students find themselves in a real bind. It is 
              difficult enough for staff to explain why students should be taught 
              to make stoneware cereal bowls in an art school, and why such a 
              skill, no matter how successfully mastered, is worth a university 
              degree. It is even more embarrassing for the student who attempts 
              to make the bowls, when surrounded by the uncompromising cool of 
              grainy video’s and multiple piercings.<BR>
              <BR>
              The tragic fact is that the alternative has often seen students 
              retreat into making bad sculpture under the tutelage of untrained 
              staff. It is tragic because the sculpture department hate people 
              muscling in on their turf, and it is self-defeating because you 
              don’t need two separate departments telling students how to make 
              sculpture. When crunch time comes and one has to go, guess who it 
              will be?<BR>
              <BR>
              Calling these sculptures ‘ceramics’ fools no one, although there 
              have been heroic attempts made to justify the field. A common argument 
              for the continuing existence of ceramics departments is one of material 
              specialization, and it goes something like this. 
            <P>Clay is just so difficult to use that lumpy blue feathered things, 
              when made out of this material, are beyond the ken of sculpture 
              departments, limited as they are to coping with relatively simple 
              tasks like large-scale bronze casting. If the department also has 
              a small percentage of students who make stoneware cereal bowls, 
              well, all the better, because everybody knows sculptors can’t do 
              that. It is absolutely no problem at assessment time, to compare 
              the cereal bowls with the blue lumpy feathered things, because they 
              both sit on plinths and short of never turning up, no one fails 
              anyway. It is purely academic. 
            <P> For the historically minded, it is easy enough to trace the onset 
              of this schizophrenic condition. It is often characterized as a 
              battle between the Anglo-Oriental Brownies and West Coast Funkers, 
              a muddy gang warfare played out on the margins of art, like a couple 
              of spectators grappling on the sidelines whilst the match goes on 
              somewhere else. The real situation is much more complex - and interesting 
              - but the fact is the fundamental split within many ceramics departments 
              must, to an outsider, look truly bizarre. 
            <P> So, how is it that students still manage to do it? The subtleties 
              of celadon are still with us, as each successive generation finds 
              ways to learn the necessary skills. The bad sculptors are hanging 
              in there as well, passing their treasured knowledge on to future 
              generations. 
            <P> The answer is that there are still some very good ceramics departments 
              left, as well as limited opportunities for advanced training. But 
              we should not fool ourselves - even the best departments are under 
              threat, and as each one closes the opportunities to acquire skills 
              and knowledge decreases. I am not worried about the bad sculptors 
              - there are sculpture departments to take care of that side of things. 
              I am worried about the potters. 
            <P> There surely is a point of critical mass, beyond which the whole 
              enterprise loses viability. As it is there are almost no potters 
              left who earn their living by selling to the general public. They 
              have become reliant on the gallery system, often paying for the 
              privilege of exhibiting. Without an art school background it is 
              unlikely that they would even have the dubious opportunity of exhibiting 
              in publicly funded spaces - they would not be ‘in the loop’. For 
              those that do, pottery has increasingly become a process of making 
              simulacrums of useful objects. It is like a friend of mine who has 
              a stack of Gwyn Piggott dinner plates, made when she was at the 
              Jam Factory workshops in Adelaide. Believe me, they don’t see the 
              inside of a dishwasher any more. 
            <P> These phenomena may explain the rise of porcelain, with its associations 
              of rarity and value. We are asked to pay a thousand dollars for 
              a group of objects arranged on a shelf, so they may be admired whilst 
              we eat our dinner out of the ten dollar China plate. There is a 
              haptic lapse, and in a reversal of the common phrase popularized 
              by Ali G, we ‘talk to the face, ‘cause the hand don’t want to know.’ 
            <P> There is much more to be said, and I know what I have written 
              is rather short on solutions - although removing ceramics departments 
              from the university system entirely might not be a bad start - but 
              at the end I am left with this question. 
            <P> If the general public has, to a large extent, stopped buying hand-made 
              pottery, and the courses are closing down one after another, is 
              it at all possible that the ceramics fraternity - we - are at fault? 
            <P> Bernard Leach (yes, the bad daddy who bothered <b><a href="082701.html">DeWaal</a></b>
              so much) was once in America, where he was doing what Bernard did 
              best, namely sharing his wisdom, or pontificating, depending on 
              your bias. (Keep in mind that people queued up for this - it wasn’t 
              like he had Yanagi judo chop them into submission.) Anyway, he had 
              seen the birth of the West Coast funk movement, when American art 
              schools, fueled up by the post-war economic miracle were full of 
              confident, questioning iconoclasts. Leach was said to have looked 
              around him in despair and asked ‘Where has pottery failed these 
              people?’ 
            <P> It still is a good question to ask. I have my answer - it’s just 
              a matter of doing it.
