              <a name="1"></a><b>1. What is raku?</b></p>
            <p>Raku is a pottery technique that has it's origins in 16th century 
              Japan. We are pretty sure that it was developed by Korean potters 
              under Japanese rule but the exact circumstances of it's development 
              and in what context it was discovered is a mystery. The raku technique, 
              like other pottery techniques such as salt glazing and pit firing, 
              primarily revolves around it's firing process although involvement 
              with raku often goes much deeper into its philosophy, roots, and 
              cultural significance. Traditional raku and our western version 
              of raku are similar in many ways though there are some significant 
              differences.</p>
            <p>To briefly describe the raku process we must understand that most 
              all other types of pottery are loaded into a cold kiln where the 
              firing proceeds slowly until the desired temperature is reached. 
              This firing cycle may take anywhere from 8-24 hours or even longer. 
              When the kiln has reached temperature (which is generally determined 
              through the use of pyrometric cones), it is shut off and allowed 
              to cool enough to be able to remove the ware using bare, or lightly 
              gloved hands. The cooling cycle may last from 12-24 hours or longer. 
              The ware is considered finished when it is taken from the kiln. 
              In raku, the pieces may be loaded into a cold kiln but are often 
              preheated and loaded into a hot kiln. The firing proceeds at a rapid 
              pace with the wares reaching temperature in as short a cycle as 
              15-20 minutes (though raku firings can last up to several hours 
              depending on the individual pieces and their firing requirements). 
              Glaze maturity is judged by the trained eye without the use of cones 
              or measuring devices. When the firing is determined to be completed 
              the wares are immediately removed from the kiln. Since at this point 
              the glaze is molten, tongs or other lifting devices are used.</p>
            <p>This is the stage in the process where traditional and contemporary 
              raku differ in technique and treatment. In our western version the 
              wares are now treated to a 'post firing reduction' phase. The wares 
              are put into a container with combustible material such as sawdust, 
              or leaves and allowed to smoke for a predetermined length of time. 
              The carbonaceous atmosphere reacts and affects the glazes and clay 
              and imparts unique effects and surfaces to the wares. Some of these 
              effects are metallic and crackled glazes surfaces and black unglazed 
              clay. When the wares have cooled, they are washed with an abrasive 
              cleaner to remove all residue of soot and ash.</p>
            <p> <a name="2"></a><b>2. Didn't Paul Soldner invent raku?</b></p>
            <p>Not exactly. Soldner is an innovator and one of a few responsible 
              for popularizing raku in this country beginning in the 1950's. Raku 
              was first developed by Korean potters under Japanese rule in the 
              17th century. The circumstances that led to its launch and spread 
              are somewhat of a mystery though.</p>
            <p> <a name="3"></a><b>3. How do pit, sawdust, smoke firing, and raku 
              differ?</b></p>
            <p>These types of firings are often confused with each other because 
              they can share some similar characteristics. Briefly, raku ware 
              is fired in a more or less conventional type kiln where glaze technology 
              is understood and utilized. The others are forms of primitive firing 
              where temperatures reached are generally lower and glazes are not 
              commonly used. In primitive firings, the &quot;kiln&quot; may consist 
              of a simple hole in the ground (ie, a pit).</p>
            <p><a name="4"></a><b>4. Isn't raku a once-fire process where you 
              don't have to bisque first?</b></p>
            <p>Raku firing greenware is a sure way to line the bottom of your 
              kiln with shards. Always bisque-fire to at least Cone 08 before 
              glazing and raku firing. </p>
            <p> <a name="5"></a><b>5. Is raku suitable for functional use?</b></p>
            <p>The traditional use of raku ware in the Japanese tea ceremony has 
              contributed to confusion about the functional use of raku. With 
              very few exceptions, all raku fired ware is fragile, porous, and 
              generally unsuitable for functional use. Unless such fragile ware 
              is treated post-firing with a non-glaze material, such as a polyurethane 
              or acrylic sealer or an oil of some kind, the pots will sweat water 
              and eventually breakdown. Treat raku as decorative. The occasional 
              use of raku in a functional setting is OK but keep in mind that 
              the glaze is soft and can be easily chipped and end up being ingested. 
              If you must use your pots for food try to limit the use to dry food. 
              The fragility of the ware also renders the reliability of handles 
              and other appendages extremely questionable. </p>
            <p> <a name="6"></a><b>6. What constitutes a raku clay?</b></p>
            <p>A raku clay is any clay that can be successfully raku fired. That 
              includes most any type of clay out there! As I say at my workshops; 
              &quot;I've never met a clay that I couldn't raku.&quot; Generally 
              though, a clay suitable for raku needs to contain a lot of fireclay 
              and similar refractory materials so that it can withstand the sudden 
              heat shock of the raku process. This includes most stock stoneware 
              clays. The clay does not have to be loaded with coarse grog but 
              it does have to be open enough to expand and contract without cracking. 
              Most clay suppliers can help you choose an appropriate clay body. 
              The other characteristics that you are looking for are your personal 
              ones such as plasticity, color, texture, etc. Nothing needs to be 
              sacrificed in order to have a good, reliable raku clay. </p>
            <p> <a name="7"></a><b>7. What is a raku glaze? </b></p>
            <p>Similar to the question of raku clays is the answer to this question. 
              Any glaze that you can successfully raku fire is a raku glaze. The 
              most important factors in identifying raku glazes is the temperature 
              at which they mature, how you plan on using them, and what kind 
              of effects you are looking for. You must also keep in mind that 
              if you are using a variety of glazes on the same pot or in the same 
              kiln load, unless you know that they all mature to your satisfaction 
              at around the same temperature, you will be faced with varying degrees 
              of maturity. However, just because a glaze is formulated to fire 
              at a temperature higher than your usual range doesn't mean that 
              you should eliminate that glaze from your pallet. Experiment with 
              your glazes to achieve a variety of surface effects from dry textures 
              to surfaces with a high gloss. Don't limit yourself to homemade 
              or personal glazes either. Try low fire commercial glazes for some 
              unusual results.</p>
            <p> <a name="8"></a><b>8. Which cones do I use in raku?</b></p>
            <p>The only cones that should be used near a raku kiln are ice cream 
              cones. Because of the fast firing, varying atmosphere, multiple 
              loads and other factors, pyrometric cones are generally poor indicators 
              of heat and temperature so they are not used. Most raku potters 
              fire their wares using the actual glaze melt as the visual indicator 
              of maturity. Many potters, however, do use pyrometers or cones to 
              warn of coming glaze maturity and then check the ware visually through 
              the peephole(s). It takes some temperature of raku depends on the 
              glazes that you are using. Most raku is fired in the range of cone 
              010-06. You must remember though that you as the maker of the pots 
              are the final expert on whether a glaze is mature,<br>
              underfired, or overfired. If a glaze is not glossy enough, doesn't 
              have the expected crackles or metallic effects, or doesn't exhibit 
              any other characteristic that you find desirable, you need to adjust 
              the firing. </p>
            <p> <a name="9"></a><b>9. How do you get those bright metallic effects? 
              Sometimes my glazes don't crackle as much as I like. What can I 
              do?</b></p>
            <p>Assuming you are using the correct glazes, both metallic effects 
              and dark crackle lines are a result of firing the glazes to their 
              maximum maturity followed by a fast post-firing reduction technique. 
              You must quickly get your pot from the kiln to the reduction container 
              and covered before the pot has a chance to cool too much, otherwise 
              the post-firing reduction will not be effective. Pronounced crackle 
              effects are also often dependent on a thick application of glaze.</p>
            <p> <a name="10"></a><b>10. All I ever get are bright metallic effects. 
              How do I get more colorful glaze effects?</b></p>
            <p>This is the exact opposite of the previous question and problem. 
              Brighter colors need a degree of post firing oxidation in order 
              to develop. There are several ways to achieve this. When you remove 
              the ware from the kiln, spray the areas with water where you would 
              like more color to develop before placing the ware in the reduction 
              container. This will oxidize and cool the glaze. Another method 
              is to hold the ware in the air for 10 - 30 seconds before reducing 
              the ware. Allow the combustible material to ignite and cover the 
              container only after flames have clearly developed. Other potters 
              will uncover the reduction container after a short time allowing 
              the material to ignite again while fanning the ware. Using these 
              and other similar techniques you will learn how to control the amount 
              of metallic and colorful effects on your wares as well as grey to 
              black unglazed areas.</p>
            <p> <a name="11"></a><b>11. Can I preheat my pots in the kiln as it 
              is warming up (starting with a cold kiln). I will be using a fiber 
              garbage can kiln with a lift-off lid, not one where the entire kiln 
              lifts off. I don't see how my pots will get preheated enough by 
              just setting them on the lid. Do they get hot enough on a fiber/expanded 
              metal lid?</b></p>
            <p>This question shows a common misunderstanding about the raku process. 
              The only time you need to be concerned about preheating your ware 
              is when you are doing multiple firing loads in the same kiln. The 
              first load should always be in a cold kiln taking the temperature 
              up slowly. Only if you are going to fire additional loads should 
              you be preheating your pots on or along-side the kiln. If the lid 
              of the kiln is a wire mesh/fiber lid then you might get enough radiant 
              heat. Place the pots near the flue opening so they get the heat 
              coming from the draft. Be careful not to place them too close, too 
              soon, or they may break. After preheating on top of the kiln you 
              can place the pieces around the base of the kiln after you remove 
              the fiber chamber, let them heat up there for a minute or two, then 
              put them on the kiln shelf letting them sit for another minute, 
              then put the chamber back in place for a minute, then re-light the 
              burner. </p>
            <p> <a name="12"></a><b>12. Must I use a certain type of kiln or can 
              I fire raku in an electric<br>
              kiln?</b></p>
            <p>Most any type of kiln can be used for raku as long as it meets 
              certain requirements of the raku process. It must be located outdoors 
              or in close proximity to the outdoors. You must be able to easily 
              reach into the kiln to remove your ware. If you are going to be 
              firing multiple loads the temperature of the kiln must be easily 
              controlled. An electric kiln is perfectly suitable for raku although 
              there are some special considerations that require careful attention. 
              You must remember that you are exposing yourself to live electrical 
              current when you open an electric kiln so you must protect yourself 
              from any possible contact with the current. There'll be more on 
              this in a subsequent revision of this FAQ. </p>
            <p> <a name="13"></a><b>13. When it comes to kilns I've heard the 
              terms flue, damper, stack, and chimney. How do they apply to raku 
              kilns?</b></p>
            <p>All fuel fired kilns need some way for the gases to exit, the air 
              flow to be controlled, and air to enter the chamber. Conventional 
              kilns have a flue, damper, and stack (or chimney). The flue is a 
              path in the kiln for the gases to move through after they have circulated 
              through the kiln on their way to the stack. The damper is a device, 
              usually a kiln shelf, that slides in and out of the lower part of 
              the stack in order to control the size of the opening, thus controlling 
              the exit of the gases and their mixture with air. Raku kilns are 
              generally small and overpowered. Most have a simple opening in the 
              top of the chamber covered by a kiln shelf shard. The kiln chamber 
              chamber is essentially the stack with the opening the flue and the 
              kiln shelf the damper.</p>
            <p> <a name="14"></a><b>14. Why can't I reach temperature no matter 
              how much gas I use?</b></p>
            <p>This is the most common question regarding the raku firing. Successful 
              rise of temperature in any fuel-fired kiln depends on the correct 
              mixture of air and fuel. A hotter kiln is not necessarily dependent 
              on more fuel! If there is too much fuel, the atmosphere will be 
              smoky, full of flames and the temperature will not rise. Also, if 
              there is too much air, the temperature will stagnate or fall. Usually, 
              the solution to a situation in which the kiln doesn't reach temperature 
              is to increase the air in the air/fuel mixture. In a gas-fired kiln 
              this can be done by increasing the available air in the burner or 
              around the burner. You can also simply open the flue (the opening 
              at the top of the kiln). Most potters use a venturi type burner 
              that has a disk that screws open or closed. Open it for more air. 
              If you are using a power burner in which a fan is attached, increase 
              the air flow. Experiment to arrive at the correct mixture but be 
              patient!</p>
            <p> <a name="15"></a><b>15. Don't the tongs used to lift the pots 
              leave marks?</b></p>
            <p>Sometimes they do. More often though the glaze is still molten 
              enough that once the pot is released from the tongs, the marks tend 
              to smooth out. In either case the tong marks should not be treated 
              as defects but rather as characteristics of raku. </p>
            <p> <a name="16"></a><b>16. I'm confused about the term 'reduction.' 
              Can you explain what this means?</b></p>
            <p>Reduction is a firing term that refers to a lack of oxygen in the 
              combustion process. This lack of oxygen in the atmosphere causes 
              the fuel to search for oxygen elsewhere to allow for more complete 
              combustion to take place. This can take place during a firing as 
              in 'reduction stoneware.' In this conventional situation, the additional 
              oxygen is found chemically bound in the the clay body and glazes. 
              The result is characteristic reduction effects. Reduction as it 
              is referred to in raku usually takes place out of the kiln separate 
              from the actual firing as described earlier. However, just because 
              you are doing raku doesn't mean that you can't experiment with actual 
              reduction firing in the more conventional sense.</p>
            <p><a name="17"></a><b>17. Must I remove my ware from the kiln to 
              apply post firing reduction or can I insert reduction material into 
              the kiln chamber?</b></p>
            <p>As described earlier, post firing reduction is normally done by 
              removing the ware from the kiln and placing it in a container with 
              your combustible material. Certain situations may make it difficult 
              to actually remove the wares from the kiln while they are hot. For 
              instance your piece may be too large or awkward to handle. In this 
              case you can achieve some post firing success by shutting off the 
              kiln, adding your reduction material to the chamber, and closing 
              off all open ports including the flue, peep hole, and burner ports. 
              At best, the chamber will be only marginally sealed and since effective 
              reduction depends on on air tight chamber, your reduction will be 
              only partially successful. If your kiln is a lift off fiber type 
              then you might try removing it and replacing it with a metal drum 
              or can for the reduction phase.</p>
            <p> <a name="18"></a><b>18. Do different types of reduction material 
              give different effects?</b></p>
            <p>The short answer is yes. The long answer is much more complicated! 
              Here is a medium answer: Your reduction effects are certainly influenced 
              by how much carbon is in the atmosphere that surrounds your pot. 
              In other words, how much smoke your pot is quickly subjected to. 
              Some materials have the potential to release more carbon than others. 
              The condition of your material (wet, damp, dry) as well as the particle 
              size as in the case of wood materials (sawdust, shavings, chips) 
              can be important. The type of wood can also affect your results.</p>
            <p> <a name="19"></a><b>19. Must there be clouds of smoke when doing 
              raku?</b></p>
            <p>Raku doesn't require smoke at all. There are two aspects of the 
              process that have the potential for creating smoke. If you are using 
              a fuel fired kiln (as opposed to an electric kiln) then it is likely 
              that there will be at least some smoke generated during the firing. 
              If you are doing post firing reduction, there will be smoke created 
              then as well. The amount of smoke is determined by the efficiency 
              of your reduction technique, the material you are using, and the 
              amount of material you are using. If you are reducing in a container, 
              the tighter the lid fits, the less smoke will exit the container. 
              There are other techniques of reduction that create less smoke than 
              others. Of course if you are not doing post firing reduction and 
              simply cooling your ware when it comes from the kiln, then there 
              is no smoke created.</p>
            <p> <a name="20"></a><b>20. What is 'smokeless raku'?</b></p>
            <p>'Smokeless raku' is not really smokeless at all. The term was coined 
              by Jerry Caplan who has been developing his techniques for many 
              years. It is a post firing reduction technique that is designed 
              to produce minimal smoke by keeping the reduction chamber as air 
              tight as possible. This can be done using a combination of tight 
              fitting lids with 'gaskets' of wet paper or cloth. The tightest 
              chamber is one made by inverting your container onto a bed of sand 
              or dirt. Arrange a ring of sand or dirt on the ground for the lid 
              of your container to fit onto when placed upside down. Place your 
              reduction material within the ring. Quickly place your ware onto 
              the material and cover it with the container pushing the rim of 
              the container into the sand. Bury the rim with additional sand to 
              keep the smoke in.</p>

              <a name="21"></a><b>21. What is meant by 'naked raku' and 'slip 
              resist' in raku?</b></p>
            <p>Naked raku or slip resist refers to a variety of techniques whereby 
              a clay slip is applied to the surface of the ware. This slip is 
              formulated to peel away during the firing, and not permanently adhere 
              to the surface. As the slip peels, shrinks, and separates from the 
              surface it exposes the ware to varying degrees of post firing reduction. 
              When the piece is cooled, whatever slips remains on the pot is removed 
              by scraping and cleaning. As a further decorative process, you can 
              scratch and draw through the slip prior to firing to create designs.</p>
