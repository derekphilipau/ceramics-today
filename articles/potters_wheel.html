            <H3 >The Sumerian Culture - The First Urban Civilization</H3>

            <P > The 
			story probably begins in the Middle East around 4000 BC (6000 BP). 
			The village settlements were growing in size and prosperity. A new 
			phase in man's development was happening. In what is today southern 
			Iraq, or Ancient Mesopotamia, the first urban civilization was being 
			created; villages grew into towns and then towns into the great city 
			states: Ur, Uruk, Ubaid, Eridu, Lagesh etc. By 3000 BC. the people 
			of these cities, the Sumerians, had already established a 
			sophisticated trading commercial culture. This was the first town 
			and city based civilization on this planet. New crafts and 
			occupations evolved. More skills and tools were invented. </P>

            <H3 >The Effects of Specialising</H3>

            <P > To a great extent all was triggered as a result of increased 
			division of labour and job specialisation within earlier small 
			communities. Of course some men still hunted and fished, but others 
			now planted crops and reared animals and, as they became more 
			experienced, farming methods improved, food production increased and 
			so did the population. Trade expanded over the whole region. More 
			pots were needed and various ways were tried to speed up all the 
			pottery techniques: making, decorating and firing. 

            <H3 >Who did what - Men or Women?</H3>

            <P > Most of these changes affected the work and life style of the 
			men much more than their womenfolk. Most women were already almost 
			fully occupied and &quot;specialising&quot; in the vital task of bearing and 
			rearing children. Any other tasks done by the women must therefore 
			have been part-time and close to the home. Women almost certainly 
			developed the techniques of sewing, weaving and basket making in 
			most prehistoric communities. They were probably also the first real 
			potters - the makers of bowls, dishes, jugs etc. so it is not 
			surprising that in these early village societies building a basket 
			and coiling a pot had a lot in common. 

            <H3 >Coiling Pots</H3>

            <A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/wocoil02es.jpg" >
			<img SRC="wocoil02bth.jpg" width=51 height=50 alt="" border="0"  ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A> 

            The ancient technique of building a coiled pot involves squeezing, 
			squashing and smoothing the successive layers of coils into a thin 
			even wall which swells or tapers as it grows and encloses a shape. 
			To do this you need to turn the pot around slowly as you work. 

            <P > Early potters soon learned to make the task of periodically 
			turning the pot much easier and more efficient by beginning their 
			coiling on a dish or bowl, or even a flat plate or smooth platter 
			they could twist round as they worked. 

            <P > <A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/ch122aas.gif" >
			<img SRC="ch122tvth.gif" width=62 height=50 alt="" border="0"  ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>

			<img SRC="ch132aath.gif" width=50 height=50 alt="" border="0"  ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>Most 
			early coiled pots are round bottomed. They were probably started in 
			a bowl which could be easily turned or rolled around whilst adding 
			and smoothing the clay coils. <br clear=all>

            </p>

            <P > <A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/ch145aas.gif" >
			<img SRC="ch145aath.gif" width=50 height=50 alt="" border="0"  ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>Other 
			coiled pots taper downwards to a small base. This would make the 
			pots easier to turn whilst coiling.</p>

            <P >The base was probably started by pressing a lump of soft clay or 
			a spiral of coils into a shallow round bottomed bowl and smoothing 
			it out with the fingers or a piece of wood or a bone rib. Coils were 
			then added progressively. The shallow bowl gave support to the soft 
			clay as first coils were added. The rounded bottom made it easy to 
			pull the pot around bit by bit. As the base and lower coils 
			gradually dried and hardened progressively they gave firmer support 
			to the soft coils being added above.</P>

            <P >In more remote regions of the world women are probably still 
			coiling pots in this way. These illustrations show these methods 
			still being used within the last century in some African villages.<br>

              Innumerable ways developed of using a platter or bowl to speed up 
			coiling. Here is an example found in the Indian subcontinent. 
			However, soon after 4000 BC. in Mesopotamia a new 
			discovery/invention was being exploited...<br clear=all>

            <H3 >The Arrival of the Wheel</H3>

            <P ><A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/wheel01s.gif" >
			<img SRC="wheel01ds.gif" width="200" height="91" alt="" border="0" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A> 

              The principle of the Wheel was discovered earliest in southern 
			Iraq(Mesopotamia). 

              <br>

            <P >By discovering the principle of the wheel, the Sumerians were 
			able to give up pulling provisions or people along on sledges or 
			dragging heavy objects over a series of logs. They devised how to 
			construct the first carts and chariots.<br>

            <P > <A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/urstand03as.jpg" >
			<img SRC="urstand03ath.jpg" width="62" height="100" alt="" border="0" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>This 
			strange wedge shaped object c. 3000 BC. was found in an ancient 
			Sumerian royal grave at Ur in Iraq. (It may have been a sounding box 
			for a harp). It includes perhaps the earliest drawings of wheeled 
			carts or chariots. The whole surface is covered with a decoration 
			made up of tiny carved pieces of lapis, ivory and limestone stuck 
			together on the wooden box with bitumen; a sort of mosaic with 
			engraved drawing. There are two main rectangular panels illustrating 
			a great battle and then the plunder and celebration. 

            <P > <A href="/articles/images/history_of_wheel/urstand02s.jpg" >
			<img SRC="urstand02th.jpg" width="77" height="50" alt="" border="0" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A>This 
			is a detail from the Battle scene: Warriors in a horse drawn cart or 
			chariot. This new weapon of war has four wooden wheels made out of 
			two semicircular pieces bolted together. It must have been a deadly 
			weapon at the time. Soon potters and other craftsmen found more 
			peaceful uses for the wheel... 

            <H3 > 

              <H3 >Faster Coiling on a Turntable...</H3>

            </H3>

            <P >Eventually a small turntable or &quot;tournette&quot; was developed. With 
			this a pot could be turned around much more easily and quickly. The 
			pot making technique in Mesopotamia now gradually gradually changed 
			during the third millennium BC as the more potters adopted the 
			turntable for making and decorating. However, it took a long time 
			for free running steady turntables to be developed, therefore 
			&quot;throwing&quot;, as we understand the technique today, did not develop 
			for a long time to come. It would be more accurate to describe this 
			turntable making process as <b>&quot;fast coiling&quot;</b>. </P>

            <H3 >And Men Became The Potters...</H3>

            <P >Until the arrival of the wheel, the women usually made the pots 
			- by coiling. With so many other responsibilities they could only be 
			part-time potters. With the invention of the wheel, men appear to 
			take over from their womenfolk the task of making pottery in most 
			ancient cultures. The villages of the Near East were now growing 
			into towns. More pottery was needed. Probably this need for 
			increased pottery production proved impossible for the women to do 
			with their considerable commitments to child rearing and food 
			preparation. Although one person can make pots more quickly with a 
			wheel, still more full-time labour is needed to decorate, finish and 
			fire this increasing amount of pottery. Clearly, in all communities 
			many people now became full-time potters from the third millennium 
			BC. onwards. 

            </P>

            <P >It appears that predominantly Matriarchal village societies 
			gradually became dominantly Patriarchal as bigger urban communities 
			became more organised and complex. (These important social changes 
			could be studied elsewhere in more detail.)
