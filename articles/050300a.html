            <p> <img src="../images/potw/wedgwood.jpg" alt="Portland Vase - Black Basalt Ware" width="160" height="237" hspace="4" align="left">Josiah 
              Wedgwood was born in Burslem, Staffordshire where potters had been 
              situated for a long time. His father was a potter himself and at 
              the age of fourteen Wedgwood was apprenticed to his brother Thomas, 
              who was also a potter. Wedgwood's heirs <a href="http://www.wedgwood.com"><b>Josiah 
              Wedgwood &amp; Sons</b></a>, still run the business today. 
            <p> Being a diligent worker and pupil Josiah soon became skilled at 
              all aspects of the trade. He soon recognized the potential market 
              that existed for ceramics in England, due to the backwardness of 
              techniques and ideas at the time. 
            <p> He was a perfecter and also innovator of a whole range of new 
              techniques in the second half of the 18th century. He discarded 
              traditional Staffordshire forms and began incorporating elements 
              of 'higher' Rococo and Neoclassical art into his work, creating 
              articles that were to become fashionable amongst the 'high society' 
              of England, which up to then had traditionally mainly used silver 
              or other metal utensils on their dinner tables. Wedgwood was also 
              remarkable for his business capabilities, always trying to get as 
              much publicity for his products as possible. He was the first potter 
              to print catalogues with illustrations of his wares, which were 
              themselves always of the best quality. 
            <p> Wedgwood's first great success was the perfection of a cream-coloured 
              crockery which had been produced in Staffordshire from the early 
              18th century onwards. The chemical composition was actually that 
              of a stoneware clay, but it was fired to an earthenware temperature 
              and lead-glazed, giving it it's characteristic creamy yellow color. 
              Wedgwood was able to eliminate the problem of crazing (he appearance 
              of small cracks in the glaze) which had been a great problem in 
              English pottery up to that time He also perfected a green glaze 
              which appeared on popular fruit and vegetable teapots, such as the 
              well-known 'cauliflower' tea- pot. The taste for such items waned 
              by the mid 1760's and the more simple 'cream-coloured' ware became 
              more popular, especially after Wedgwood was conferred royal patronage 
              by Queen Charlotte of England, in merit of this ware, which was 
              from then on called <a href="http://www.netcentral.co.uk:80/steveb/queens.html">'Queen's
              Ware'</a>. This 'Queen's Ware' became so popular and well-known 
              that in 1767 Wedgwood wrote: "The demand for this said cream color., 
              alias Queen's Ware, alias Ivory still increases. It is really amazing 
              how rapidly the use of it has spread almost over the whole globe 
              and how universally it is liked." 
            <p> Being named 'Potter to Her Majesty' led to a huge amount of publicity 
              for Wedgwood. This association with the Queen proved to be very 
              fruitful and Wedgwood didn't hesitate to capitalize on the fact 
              by using the term 'Queen's Ware' as much as possible. 
            <p> In 1770 he received an order from the Empress Catherine the Great 
              of Russia for a 'Queen's Ware' dinner service for two dozen people 
              and in 1773 a further order for a dinner and dessert service for 
              fifty people. This set was completed in 1774 and consisted of over 
              950 pieces which were decorated with scenes from the English countryside. 
              Wedgwood must have known that an order such as this one would not 
              be very profitable due to the high costs of production (each plate 
              was decorated with an individual scene as a 'one-off' piece) but 
              he was not one to let such a publicity opportunity slip through 
              his hands. In her book 'The Story of Wedgwood' Alison Kelly states 
              that "No expense was spared, and the financial outlay was extremely 
              small. Catherine the Great's archives show that she paid Wedgwood 
              16,406 rubles and 43 kopeks, or a little over 2,!00 pounds, while 
              his expenses have been calculated as being about 2,612 pounds. However 
              as an advertisement the service amply justified itself. It was put 
              on display in Josiah's Greek Street showrooms, was visited by the 
              nobility and also Queen Charlotte, and became the fashionable topic 
              of conversation."
