              Article by Ron Earl<br>
              <br>
              My recently published book, <a href="toby.html"><b>Toby Jug-The
              Most Underestimated Antique!</b></a> has already created frantic 
              waves of people searching their attics and cup&shy;boards for the 
              elusive Jug.<br>
              <br>
              Everybody claims to have at least one, but on further questioning 
              the one usually turns out to be a seaside holiday jug or at best, 
              although quite collectable, a Royal Doulton Character Jug. Although 
              there are a few Doultons capable of real&shy;ising big sums, most 
              Character Jugs can be bought for between &pound;70-&pound;200.<br>
              <br>
              The absence of the real Toby has become quite apparent, a viewpoint 
              which I personally have held for a few years. 
            <p>&nbsp;
            <table width="64%" border="0" align="center">
              <tr valign="top"> 
                <td width="27%"><img src="images/toby/cross_legged.jpg" width="110" height="180"></td>
                <td width="73%">A 1870 cross legged Toby similar to this will 
                  usually cost around &pound;150.00. If Longton 1850 is impressed 
                  on base expect to pay up to &pound;350.00.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p> For this level of investment, say &pound;150-&pound;200, a nice 
              late Victorian Toby can be purchased, and may probably still be 
              intact with his detachable crown.<br>
              <br>
              But let us go back to 1760 when the first Tobys emerged. A good 
              Ralph Wood can be bought for &pound;1,500. If it has the mould number 
              on the base maybe it will fetch &pound;1,800. If it is signed or 
              has the Burslem mark you may well be looking at &pound;2,500+. These 
              jugs with their attractive running glazes are now very sought after. 
              When did you last see one for sale? The enamelled Toby from say 
              1800-1830 may well fetch up to &pound;1,100 for a good specimen. 
              I would say a good specimen without major repair or replacement 
              hands etc, but maybe some minor cracking or small chips are quite 
              acceptable in Toby Jugs of this age. They probably have had a hard 
              life.
            <p>&nbsp;
            <table width="78%" border="0" align="center">
              <tr valign="top"> 
                <td width="27%"><img src="images/toby/walton.jpg" width="154" height="251"></td>
                <td width="73%"><p>1830-1870 sees Jugs fetching around &pound;400-&pound;800 depending on quality, a Walton Jug with a nice 
                    factory mark will fetch more as will a good Davenport with 
                    its anchor mark on and date. Any genuine mark which will help 
                    to identify a pottery or potter will always enhance the price. 
                  </p>
                  <p>A very nice Faience Jug, probably about 1890, this will cost 
                    in the region of &pound;700-&pound;800. </p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>French Faience jugs tend not to be so collectable, but a nice specimen, 
              say 1890-1910 can fetch up to &pound;800. One major difference 
              with faience jugs is that they always carry considerable detail 
              on the base regarding the artist and pottery, amongst other things, 
              unlike 90% of Staffordshire and Yorkshire jugs which are generally 
              unmarked. A nice impressed crown on a good Yorkshire may well add 
              &pound;200-&pound;300 pounds to its value.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/toby/blue_coat.jpg" width="123" height="180" hspace="6"><img src="images/toby/light_blue_coat.jpg" width="118" height="180" hspace="6"></p>
            <p>The Jug sporting the dark blue coat dates from around 1880 and 
              if in good condition can be bought for about &pound;130. The Jug 
              with the light blue coat dates from around 1830 and would cost anything 
              between &pound;500-&pound;800 depending on condition.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/toby/thin_man.jpg" width="96" height="180" hspace="6"><img src="images/toby/prattware.jpg" width="118" height="180" hspace="6"></p>
            <p>The Jug wearing the green coat is The Thin Man. He pre-dates most 
              Tobys being potted in 1770. A Thin Man can fetch up to &pound;5000 
              if unrestored and in fine shape. The Jug with the floral coat is 
              a good example of a Prattware, 1830 and would cost around &pound;700 
              for a good specimen.</p>
            <p>I am totally convinced that the current interest in Toby Jugs will 
              cause a spectacular rise in their value. Many are being exported, 
              some get broken, there will never be enough to satisfy demand.</p>
            <p>I confidently predict a rise in their value over the next few years 
              by as much as 80%. They must be a good investment, but look after 
              them, keep them behind glass and don't keep washing them in hot 
              detergents-beware.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/toby/pock_marked_toby.jpg" width="132" height="180" hspace="6"><img src="images/toby/snuff_taker.jpg" width="110" height="180" hspace="6"></p>
            <p>A fine enamelled-finished jug about 1840, with good floral decoration, 
              with a puce coloured coat, would cost about &pound;500-&pound;600. 
              He has a well painted face and pock marks, which are well defined. 
              The other illustration shows an early snuff taker (a variation to 
              the Ordinary Toby), and would fetch about &pound;250-&pound;350 
              for this 1840 specimen.</p>
            <p> I am certain that Toby Jugs and their variants, (Martha Gunn, 
              The Gin Lady, The Snuff Taker, Heart Goodfellow, the Cross Legged 
              Jolly Miller), would be of historical interest to all those interested 
              in the world of ceramics. When one considers the bottle-kiln firing 
              which was available in 1790, for example, with no electric thermostats 
              or modern technology, it is a wonder so many beautiful jugs were 
              so well made and have existed to this very day.</p>
            <p>I would be very pleased to hear from any readers of Ceramics Today 
              who can help me into my research on Tobys and their makers. Email:
