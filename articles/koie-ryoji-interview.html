              </B>&quot;Go ahead, ask me anything you want,&quot; he said. His 
              loud and bright voice struck me and the whole room brightened up. 
              This man in front of me, with the cheerful smile on his sun-tanned 
              face, this is the pottery master-star, Mr. Koie Ryoji. &quot;Ha, 
              ha, ha, good, good, and?&quot; he says with warmth, making me feel 
              at ease. It turns out he was doing all this to help me loosen up 
              and relax a bit.<BR>
              <BR>
              In the world of practical pottery (e.g., chawan, tsubo, plates), 
              Koie Ryoji has developed his own realm, beyond any prejudiced concept 
              of pottery or what it means. In the world of modern art, moreover, 
              he has been sending important messages to society through other 
              artistic endeavors, such as his &quot;Returning to Clay&quot; series. 
              Koie takes pleasure in freely exploring the two realms. With a flexible 
              attitude and a power beyond national borders -- which does not allow 
              him to stay in one place very long -- people cannot help being attracted 
              to him.<BR>
              <BR>
              Yes, now I get it! I know that's the reason why young wannabe-potters, 
              not only Japanese, but also from other countries, gather around 
              him; the reason why many potters make Koie-like works unintentionally. 
              I understand the reasons so well now. </FONT></P>

              are not the only thing that keeps him busy.<BR>

              <B>Y:</B> You are so well tanned.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I went to Hokkaido to make a monument and I worked outside 
              all the time for more then ten days. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> What kind of monument?<BR>
              <BR>

              I dug a long groove -- about 10 centimeters wide in the ground, 
              swiftly poured in liquid aluminum, and set an aluminum column in 
              the groove standing up.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> So, it isn't yakimono, is it?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Well, it is yakimono. The aluminum was about 700 degrees 
              centigrade, so the ground got burned. Therefore, it was yakimono. 
              It is just a standing column, but it left a scorch mark on the ground. 
              That's like &quot;Scar Art.&quot;<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Sounds very poetic. Where is it?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Atsuta-mura (village). It is a small village with a population 
              of 3,000, located north of Ishikari city. Nice place it is. It's 
              by the Japan Sea, so a lot of driftage shows up from Russia and 
              Korea. Looking at all that stuff is interesting! I'm the type of 
              guy who finds anything interesting.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> But still, doing that at such a busy time, with all your 
              exhibitions.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I am crazily busy. As such, I am happy and thankful. I 
              don't mind being so busy as being too fragile to be broken. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> When do you sleep?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Well, I sleep when I'm sleepy, and I drink when I want 
              to. Those times are what I call my sleeping hours. I used to sleep 
              three times a day. You know, I don't work without drinking. So I 
              do my job while drinking, and when I get tired from drinking too 
              much, I go to bed. Then, when I wake up, I start drinking and working. 
              I kept repeating that. In that respect, I felt like I lived three 
              times more than a regular person. I used to work that much. I don't 
              work as hard these days, but I think it's ok anyway. As a result, 
              my sleeping hours are totally messed up. There are people who have 
              decided to sleep six to eight hours. But, I believe it doesn't have 
              to be decided. In the last firing, I fired for 11 days continuously, 
              so I hardly slept. &quot;What is being awake?&quot; I sometimes 
              wonder. I know people who are awake yet sleeping. I sometimes find 
              a guy eyes-open who must be sleeping for Christsake. Then, there 
              are people who are sleeping, while being awake, who are all ears.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Ummm, one can never be too careful.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Yeah, yeah. Yet, I don't want to be obsessed with prejudices 
              or something. Once you are stuck with prejudices, it's over. It's 
              no fun just to live. You have to experience the fun of living.&nbsp;

              I would like to introduce Koie's works as recently exhibited at 
              the Akasaka Inui Gallery, where this interview took place. Wait, 
              I have to mention this before continuing -- his newly built anagama 
              (single-chamber kiln) in his hometown of Okujo Amagasa (in Tokoname, 
              Aichi), made the news because of its size, 20 meters in length. 
              It's called the Muteppo-gama, or Temerity Kiln. It was intentionally 
              made to fire ceramics uneven. That is very Koie-ish, what one might 
              expect from this artist. Since I had just recently seen another 
              Koie exhibition, one displaying big tsubo made at that kiln (I vividly 
              remember some brownish tsubo), I was expecting similar works at 
              the current exhibit, especially in light of the interest sparked 
              by the Muteppo-gama. Yet, the space looked like this: </FONT></P>

              I expected that you would go with brown works.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I knew it. It is my job to betray people's expectations. 
              Almost all my clients look forward to seeing &quot;How is he going 
              to betray us this time.&quot; When one thinks, &quot;Koie must go

              <B>Y:</B> I see green linear yakimono standing side by side. What 
              is that expressing? I first thought it was something like a forest, 
              but the more I look, it begins looking like Manhattan. <BR>

                                depiction of the group of buildings in Manhattan 
                                where the terrorist attacks took place. His deep 
                                green copper glaze falls on the unspeaking building. 
                                The title of all these works is &quot;Mizaru, 
                                Iwazaru, Kikazaru.&quot;&nbsp; Three Nikko monkeys, 
                                the Mallet of Luck, Daikoku-ten (The God of Wealth 
                                and Farmers), and Ebisu (God of Commerce) can 
                                be seen between the Manhattan buildings standing 
                                side by side. They look like decorative objects 
                                at first glance, but they can be used as vases. 
                                They were fired in a gas kiln.</I></FONT><I></I></P></TD>

              What is your message in the title, &quot;Mizaru, Iwazaru, Kikazaru?&quot;<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> There are Mizaru, Iwazaru, Kikazaru (see, speak, hear 
              no evil), but there is no Tsukurazaru, or &quot;make no evil.&quot; 
              Rather than seeing or speaking or hearing unnecessary things, one 
              should instead be involved in creating. The hidden meaning of the 
              pieces is that one can do what they want to, instead of only listening 
              to what someone else is saying.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> I can see a Mallet of Luck, Daikoku-ten, and even Ebisu. 
              Those are all good luck talisman. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> The rush of business! (laughs)<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Making a wish or having one's dream come true?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> It is all up to how one interprets it. I do not care.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Is this green glaze Oribe?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> It's better to think of it as a copper glaze. People call 
              this an Oribe glaze, but one can think more simply, more loosely. 
              Copper glazes include green glaze, shinsha (red) glaze, kinyo (grayish) 
              glaze, etc. Copper is the uniform material for all those glazes, 
              so you can include everything and think of it as &quot;copper glaze.&quot; 
              And among Oribe, there are many kinds, like kuro (black) Oribe, 
              aka (red) Oribe, and Shino Oribe. Thus, if you stop referring to 
              Oribe so simply, some would say, &quot;You know about this very 
              well. What a smart person you are!&quot; (laughs)<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> I will start using the word &quot;copper glaze&quot; from 
              now on! And now, looking at this piece (photo below), what is this 
              reddish thing? </FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="-1" CLASS="normal" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif,sans-serif"><B>K:</B> 
              The bases of the marks are shells. Those spots turn out red because 
              the shells contain salts. This technique has been used since very 
              old times. Ancient people were very flexible in their ways of thinking 
              and they took risks. As civilization progressed and living got more 
              convenient, people started thinking in narrower ways. People have 
              become shabby.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> The horrible terrorist attacks of September 11 in New 
              York changed the whole world. Why did you choose this time, a year 
              after the attacks, to make these pieces?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> It's not like something was finished yesterday, and I 
              make something today. I think it's better to make something after 
              the incident sinks in. I've made series like &quot;No More Hiroshima, 
              Nagasaki&quot; and &quot;Chernobyl.&quot; I do believe those things 
              should not be created right after the incidents. In between, I have 
              listened to many kinds of music, seen dances, plays, and fashion 
              shows, and read books. Creating something for me is like having 
              those accumulated things blossom.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> It requires an aging time.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Right, I have to have things ferment within myself.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> You are doing workshops all over the world. Where were 
              you at the time of the attacks?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I was in Korea at that time. My American friend from New 
              Jersey was with me, and he got white-faced and could do no work 
              at all. I suggested to him, &quot;Hey come to Japan. You can work 
              with me for a while,&quot; because he could not get back to America 
              for the time being. But it didn't work out. He was so terrified. 
              That was quite sad. </FONT></P>

              the 60's<BR>
              When the World was a Fun Place<BR>
              <BR>
              Y:</B> As I see your chain of performances, I am reminded of John 
              Lennon and Yoko Ono. What do you think about them?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> They're wonderful. So were the Beatles. The long and short 
              of it is that the 1960s was a most interesting and changeable period. 
              Students acted like real students and had the energy to change the 
              world. The same can be said of the world of art. I came out at that 
              time. After all, a person needs to be broken up, proliferating in 
              other words, maybe? It is ok to change your mind day after day. 
              I think that is what makes one a person. It is also very human that 
              one thinks on the same subject continuously, but it is better to 
              have many different thoughts. So, if one makes pottery, one has 
              to do other things (for example, free jazz) as well or it won't 
              work out. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Talking about jazz, musicians often play ad-lib. The exquisite 
              feeling radiating from jazz is very similar to your physical rhythm 
              when you are creating ceramics. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I think they are quite similar. I agree with what you 
              mentioned about ad-lib. I do play piano.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Do you? Piano?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Yeah, everybody is surprised because I 'm so good at it. 
              Everybody lets loose a &quot;ha, ha, ha.&quot; This is how I act. 
              I teach at the university (Aich Prefectural University of Fine Arts 
              and Music). But, I go to the university on the condition of not 
              teaching, so I do not teach! There is nothing that someone like 
              me can teach brilliant students. Yet, they are such turkeys. They 
              are worried like, &quot;What should I create?&quot; or &quot;How 
              can I make a hit?&quot; They should be creating something if they 
              have time to worry. That's what I think. </FONT>

              Workshops <BR>
              <BR>
              Y:</B> You've had workshops in eight different countries so far. 
              How do you deal with the language problem?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Well, as long as we create something, we do not need words. 
              Our creations stand between the words. So, between &quot;ha&quot; 
              and &quot;well&quot; is a piece of work. So, I create works without 
              words, and when I wave my hand, a drink will come without me saying 
              &quot;Give me a drink.&quot;<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> I wonder how it works so well. (laughs)<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> That's how it is. Yes! (emphatically)<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> In the workshop, do people show their works to each other 
              like &quot;this is my way?&quot;<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Uh-huh. When I went to a restaurant in Israel, the master 
              of the restaurant was better at the wheel than I. Saying, &quot;Get 
              out of the way, I'll do it,&quot; he made a huge tsubo in seconds. 
              He used to be a potter. That made the whole thing interesting. <BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> Was he that good?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> He just had skill. What's more important is what else 
              is in the work. There is no meaning in just creating something. 
              There are many handy people around, and just being a handy person 
              is not good enough. I feel sorry for those skillful people. They 
              do everything smoothly so therefore they don't convey feelings in 
              their work.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> To finish here, could you give us your words on how to 
              have more GENKI (vigor) in Japan?<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> I began thinking about what Japan is when I was making 
              ceramics outside Japan. I want to love this country, but cannot 
              love it as I'd like to. I don't know how to express it. I want my 
              work to go beyond borders. We've had enough of being swayed by other 
              countries. War occurs because there is a country. If there were 
              no countries, there would be no wars.<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>Y:</B> I see. You are right.<BR>
              (All of a sudden, Koie grabbed the tape recorder and began speaking 
              like a radio announcer.)<BR>
              <BR>
              <B>K:</B> Well, this is how I am. I appreciate all of your continuous 
              support. I will talk to all of you face to face. Everybody all over 
              Japan, please be well. Everybody in the world, be well too.<BR>
              <BR>
              People present in the gallery burst into laughter. </FONT>
