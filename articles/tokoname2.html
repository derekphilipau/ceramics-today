            <p><b>Redware</b><br>
              <img src="images/tokoname/kyusu.jpg" alt="Redware teapot" width="206" height="174" align="left">Redware 
              teapots are famous as typical Tokoname ware, so that one remembers 
              red-brown teapots immediately when one hears the name of Tokoname. 
              It was relatively earlier in the history of Tokoname ceramics that 
              redware was introduced. It was during the period from 1861 to 1864. 
              Tea ware for green tea like teapots had been produced since the 
              early 19th century in Tokoname following the popularity of the custom 
              of green tea drinking from the late Edo era. Typical tea ware during 
              this period was redware produced in China. Mr. Jyumon Sugie and 
              Nikou Kataoka started to make redware for the first time in Tokoname.</p>
            <p> Tokoname redware was made by the clay from rice fields which contained 
              lots of iron. This clay gave the ware a rich deep red color. Producing 
              redware drastically changed Tokoname's ceramic industry. Potters 
              who specialize in making redware teapots appeared in addition to 
              those who had made conventional large products such as jars and 
              pots. Important to the development of Tokoname ceramics was a Chinese 
              potter Jin Shi Heng who was invited to teach Chinese teapot making 
              technique to Tokoname potters in 1878. This greatly helped the rapid 
              development of redware teapots. The technique of carving small letters 
              on teapots started from the time Jin Shi Heng came to Tokoname.</p>
            <p> Jin Shi Heng's visit extremely influenced not only ceramic making 
              techniques but the craftsmanship which Tokoname's ceramic industry 
              had previously lacked.</p>
            <p><b>A square down-draft kiln with two mouths</b><br>
              A square down-draft kiln with two fire mouths was invented in the 
              late Meiji era. They were the result of improvements on conventional 
              kiln designs based on the latest European technology. Two fire mouths 
              were made on the each side of the kiln and the entrance at the front. 
              The flames coming from the mouths move up over the partition or 
              bag wall set in the kiln. The two flames collide on the ceiling, 
              and go down to the floor and out to the chimney through the flue.</p>
            <p> The sizes of kilns were diverse. The largest one was 19.4m x 6.4m 
              long and the average one was 7.3m x3.9m. The ceiling has an arch 
              shape. The chimney is built of bricks. This type of kiln rapidly 
              prevailed during the Taisho era. Eighty-six kilns existed in Tokoname 
              in 1929. Coal was used as a fuel in the early days, heavy oil gradually 
              took its place because it was easier to control and it reduced labor 
              costs. However as anti air pollution laws were tightened, and cheap 
              heavy oil was not able to reach the standards, production costs 
              to buy expensive heavy oil soared, which made these kilns obsolete. 
              Slowly these kilns disappeared.</p>
            <p> Ceramic pipes, flower pots, bonsai pots, charcoal braziers, ornaments, 
              jars and pots were fired in square down-draft kilns with two fire 
              mouths.</p>
            <p><b>Pottery and Porcelain</b><br>
              Pottery quite simply is fired clay. Porcelain is made of crushed 
              stones. The firing temperature of porcelain is higher than that 
              of pottery. Porcelain is baked at around 1,300 C compared with pottery 
              which require lower temperatures. In Tokoname red clay is fired 
              at about 1,150 C and mountain clay about 1.200 C.</p>
            <p><b>Craftsman with traditional techniques (Dento-kougeishi)</b><br>
              Dento-kougeishi is a title given to a craftsman designated by the 
              minister of International Trade and Industry Ministry as a person 
              who has excellent traditional techniques. He or she has to be nominated 
              by people who have more than 12 years experience with ceramics in 
              the area producing traditional arts and crafts.<br>

              <b>Egoro or Saggar</b><br>
              <img src="images/tokoname/egoro.jpg" alt="Saggars" width="267" height="200" vspace="3" align="left">Egoro 
              is a container for loading kilns which is also known as &quot;Saya&quot;. 
              They are used when products don't require to be touched directly 
              by flames. They protect the products from the combustion of wood 
              and coal and from unnecessary color changes. Moreover they are piled 
              up in the kiln allowing for greater kiln efficiency. Egoro is fired 
              many times, subsequently its surface acquires a natural glaze effect. 
              Some of them have an appeal equivalent to ceramic works.</p>

            <p><b>Clay</b><br>
              There are various kinds of materials used to make ceramics. Roughly 
              divided, the major kinds are pottery and porcelain. Clay is for 
              pottery, crushed stones for porcelain. In Tokoname crushed stones 
              is used for sanitary ware and construction tiles. On the other hand 
              different types of clay is used according to the products. Some 
              potters make their own original clay mixing many kinds of clays 
              to make their works distinguished. In addition, clay factories produce 
              a wide range of clays, as a result people in the pottery business 
              can buy suitable clays according to their needs.<br>
              Today, various types of clays from other pottery areas come to Tokoname, 
              so many clays from all over the country are available here. Material 
              for porcelain products has to be brought to Tokoname from other 
              places. Clay also comes from Seto, Shigaraki and Iga. In the old 
              days each pottery town had one specific and unique type of ceramics 
              due to its original clay, but nowadays it has changed.</p>
