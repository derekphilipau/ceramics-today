              by Delia Robinson<br>
            </p>
            <p>Drinkers carousing in a Medieval tavern could have their brew served 
              in pottery mugs especially designed for by Delia Robinson</p>
            <p><br>
              <img src="images/puzzle_jugs/puzzle_jug.jpg" width="178" height="228" align="left">In 
              the simple pre-electronic days of old, drinkers carousing in taverns 
              might have enjoyed their brew from pottery mugs especially designed 
              for boisterous amusement. A ceramic frog peering from the bottom 
              of the cup, or a chirping whistle mug, such were the creations of 
              long-gone potters to enhance the hilarity of happy hour.</p>
            <p>Unless held to the mouth in exactly the right way, a Puzzle Mug 
              would spill beer down the drinkers shirt. This was a big hit with 
              the tavern crowd. The mugs were designed with multiple dribble holes 
              and tunnels inside the handle and cup rim, the handle or walls connected 
              to a drinking spout at the lip of the cup. This would allow the 
              drinker to suck up his beverage, providing his fingers covered the 
              right combination of false drinking spouts also placed around the 
              cup lip. If he attempted drinking from the cup in the customary 
              fashion, the beverage would pour out through perforations carved 
              just under the lip. As the evening progressed into a rowdy uproar, 
              finding the safe spot from which to drink would become increasingly 
              chancy, providing merriment for all.</p>
            <p>Staggering home in clothing soaked in beer has lost some appeal 
              down the centuries. This might explain why puzzle mugs have gone 
              out of vogue. They linger in a crude modern counterpart, the dribble 
              glass, found in novelty shops. This, merely a glass drilled with 
              a dribbling hole, is a far cry from the elaborate pottery concoctions 
              designed to send tavern patrons into stitches. </p>
            <p>&#8216;Fuddling cups&#8217;, charmingly named, required less skill 
              from the potter, but more from the drinker. They consisted of multiple 
              cups attached side by side into one diabolically messy drinking 
              container. Passageways between the cups required the drinker to 
              carefully empty them in the correct sequence. The wrong choice resulted 
              in a drenching, the right choice in befuddlement.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/puzzle_jugs/fuddling_cup.jpg" width="247" height="256"></p>
            <p>Joke mugs have lost none of their popularity over time. A slip 
              trailed witticism on a Staffordshire cup has its counterpart in 
              the office coffee mug of today, with its snappy saying or cartoon. 
              Even the frog in the mug has surfaced repeatedly, metamorphosing 
              into everything from submarines to naked ladies. A cup of this sort 
              was named a Nightingale, a genteel name suitable for tea drinkers. 
            </p>
            <p>Another option for the noisy set was the whistle mug. These came 
              in several variations. In the simplest, a whistle was affixed to 
              the handle of the cup. In a more complex form, the whistle chamber 
              was made to connect with an air passage into the bowl of the cup. 
              When empty and the whistle blown, only one note was emitted. When 
              the cup was full, the air bubbling through the liquid created melodious 
              trills and warblings. Some people insist it is correctly called 
              a Hubblebubble, which would seem to require beer.</p>
            <p><img src="images/puzzle_jugs/communal.jpg" width="150" height="86" align="left">Drinkers 
              from the past must have been a convivial lot. Many of the early 
              tavern mugs are found with two or more handles. This allowed several 
              drinkers seated around the table to have equal access to the brew. 
              At banquets, two handled &#8216;loving cups&#8217; could be passed 
              easily along a line of guests, each taking a swig. Two handled cups 
              still persist, but, but primarily in their even more antique function, 
              for sports awards. Their utility is largely over; the beverage sharers 
              of today don&#8217;t require special containers but just pass the 
              bottle. </p>
            <p>Since their heyday in the raucous taverns of the 16th-18th centuries, 
              the trickier cups have become rare specialty items. Whistle mugs 
              are still produced in Germany with the barrel shape reminiscent 
              of old tankards. Like their predecessors, they are often impressively 
              large. They hold amounts that could easily put several drinking 
              cronies under the table, though the one handle with a whistle perched 
              jauntily on top, suggests that a single drinker is expected to finish 
              it all. </p>
