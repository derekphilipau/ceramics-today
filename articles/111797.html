<H3>Andy Goldschmidt: Sculptural Ceramics</H3>

<P> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/i_gills.gif" alt="I">t is not often that 
  a ceramics site comes along that is nicely designed and features good work too. 
  <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/"><B>Andy Goldschmidts</B></A> 
  site is such a one. The simply designed pages do not constitute html or java 
  overkill, making them difficult to download or impossible to view, as is sometimes 
  the case. Rather, the simple structure will allow just about any browser to 
  be able to read the page. 
<P> Goldschmidt says of his work, that it is intent on &quot;finding connections 
  between times and places, between peoples and cultures, and in the timeless 
  metaphors of the vessel and sculpture as the embodiment of man.&quot; His <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/sculptur.html"><B>sculptural 
  vessels</B></A> reflect historic designs, the traditional pueblo traditions 
  of the south west of North America. Interesting that another artist -- <A HREF="033197.html"><B>Michael
  Lucero</B></A>, comes from a similar background. 
<P> The <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/sculptur.html"><B>sculptural 
  work</B></A> is more geometric, with complex surface designs. The stone-like 
  <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/media/2equals1.gif"><B><I>Two 
  Equals One</I></B></A> displays intersecting pathways reminiscent of the art 
  of several aboriginal cultures. Perhaps it is the interconnectedness of the 
  people and the land that is being expressed here. A contrast to this is the 
  more stark geometric <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/media/prism4d.gif"><B><I>prism-4D</I></B></A>, 
  which has contrasting angular surfaces. The sky-like decoration on some of these 
  surfaces seem like a window into another realm, perhaps that of a lost Eden. 
<P>
Andy Goldschmidt was born in Buenos Aires, and now works in California and New Mexico. He also restores <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~agoldschmidt/wizzg.html"><B>ethnographic ceramics</B></A>.
