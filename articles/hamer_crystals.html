              are all keen to make a mixture of minerals, take it to a temperature 
              and wonder at transformations &#8211;or we should be. It is like 
              pushing seeds into a garden and, with a bit of nurture, flowers 
              open and spread their colours. Making crystals is like that: a lot 
              of science, patience and beauty. Large crystals grown in a glaze 
              even look like flowers. They often resemble lichens and three-dimensional 
              fans and feathers. </p>

            <p>Crystalline glazes are those in which the oxides in the melt reform 
              in new associations as the glaze cools to give a glass with crystals 
              visible at the surface. A mass of crystals too small to be seen 
              individually can give opacity and matt surfaces. Larger crystals 
              can be grown upwards of 15 cm, appearing to float in a glassy matrix. 
              These wonderful shapes, of distinctly different colour from their 
              background are the result of manipulating the glaze formula and 
              the cooling rate of the kiln. This is the science and the patience. 
              The beauty manifests itself magically from these processes.</p>
            <p> Typical crystal shapes are soft flat rounds which may impinge 
              on each other in clusters, modifying the symmetry. A central star 
              or bundle of needles can be seen in a smooth area before a fibrous 
              ring fans out as a halo. Further haloes edge the shape where it 
              meets the background glaze or matrix. The whole of this shape is 
              coloured by the penetration of a colouring oxide into the crystal 
              and is clearly seen against the background. There is often a delicate 
              fringe of a slightly different colour where crystal meets matrix. 
              The haloes can be deliberately placed centrally or around the border 
              of the crystal. Where the glaze is thicker, as in the well of a 
              bowl, the three-dimensional forms can be seen as fibrous fans filling 
              the depth. Time is needed during the cooling of the glaze for crystals 
              to form.</p>
            <p>In the early stages of cooling, if the temperature is held around 
              1090&ordm;C for approximately two hours, the crystals begin as simple 
              needle shapes. These can fan out at each end into &#8216;double-axehead 
              shapes&#8217;. These attractive and intriguing crystals can be retained, 
              frozen at this stage by cooling the kiln rapidly after this growing 
              period. The fuller rounder shapes develop when the temperature is 
              subsequently maintained for further crystal growing periods. These 
              periods, or pauses, are programmed into the cooling graph of the 
              kiln controller and may last from three to eight hours. </p>

                <td width="62%"> <p>Each glaze component has a particular role 
                    but these are not single elements and their contributions 
                    overlap. The frit is designed to make the glaze melt quickly 
                    at top temperature. This presents a fully molten mix which 
                    is immediately ready for the new bondings to be formed. The 
                    rapid firing up to and down from the top temperature avoids 
                    the formation of a body-glaze layer which inhibits the forming 
                    of large crystals. Zinc oxide combines with flint and provides 
                    the zinc silicate for large crystals. The china clay gives 
                    stability and hardness to the final glaze. The flint is almost 
                    pure silica. It can be a different type from that provided 
                    by the frit for the main glassy ingredient and supplies nuclei 
                    for crystals. Titanium oxide contributes nuclei as &#8216;seeds&#8217; 
                    for the initiation of crystals. It also brightens colours 
                    and assists the movement of colour in the glaze. </p>
                  <p>The oxides (or carbonates which lose their carbon and excess 
                    oxygen in the fusion) of copper, cobalt and manganese, colour 
                    the glaze matrix, or the crystals, or sometimes both in specific 
                    ways, according to their &#8216;field strengths&#8217;. </p>
                  <p>Crystals grow in the cooling glaze by the isolation of particular 
                    oxides from the surrounding glaze. Zinc silicate is most often 
                    the material of large crystals. In the molten glaze the molecules 
                    of the glaze minerals are loosened from their original combinations 
                    giving a fluid mixture of individual molecules. In a normal 
                    glaze, as cooling begins, these molecules link together to 
                    form irregular chains. This creates the amorphous substance, 
                    glass. For crystals to develop, the temperature is held for 
                    those periods when molecules orientate into more specifically 
                    organised chains. They establish bonds which produce lattice 
                    structures which are the framework of crystals. The unsatisfied 
                    valencies existing in the melt link to sites where they form 
                    new combinations. </p></td>

                    of the remaining oxides can no longer remain unattached. They 
                    combine as larger molecules and stiffen the matrix. The matrix

            <p><img src="images/crystals/quote.jpg" width="177" height="496" align="right">There 
              are orders and preferences for how the molecules which jostle freely 
              in the melt will re-bond into new lattice structures. Each element 
              is characterised by a value number or valency. This number is based 
              on the number of electrons in each atom and establishes its combining 
              power. Valencies are balanced to match. For example, hydrogen is 
              1, oxygen is 2, therefore two hydrogen atoms are needed to match 
              one oxygen, giving the familiar chemical symbol H2O (water). <br>
              The elements which are frequently used to colour the zinc silicate 
              crystals are cobalt, manganese and copper. They have valencies of 
              cobalt 2 and 3, manganese 2, 3 and 4, and copper 1 and 2. They have 
              2 in common with zinc and therefore compete for the same sites when 
              new combinations are being formed. In the Periodic Table the colouring 
              elements are grouped together as &#8216;transition&#8217; elements. 
              Other elements in this grouping have similar properties and are 
              likely to be useful in a similar way. <br>
              There are further rules which govern the selective process by which 
              crystals are positively coloured, why blue on an ochre ground predominates 
              whereas green can be subtly combined. The electrons of the atoms, 
              which are negatively charged, exert forces of attraction or repulsion 
              on others which are in close proximity. This activity is referred 
              to as an energy field. Colour separation is explained in the following 
              extract from the section on crystalline glazes in The Potter&#8217;s 
              Dictionary: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>In order to colour the precipitating zinc-silicate crystals, 
                the colouring oxides must be able to fit into the lattice structure. 
                To enter the crystal, the metal colouring atom must be able to 
                occupy one of the six sites otherwise held by zinc in the zinc-silicate 
                lattice. Cobalt, nickel, copper, iron and manganese are transition 
                metals and are adjacent to zinc in the periodic table. They are 
                polyvalent and can be divalent to match zinc. Their atom sizes 
                are also similar to that of zinc. Therefore all these metals can 
                enter and colour the crystals. </i></p>

            <p>The reason for the order of precedence is that they have different 
              liquid-to-crystal partition co-efficients, or field strengths. Cobalt 
              oxide and nickel oxide have high field strengths. Manganese oxide 
              is intermediate and copper oxide is low. Zinc oxide has a higher 
              field strength than does copper oxide and, therefore, copper oxide 
              tends not to partition strongly but will stain both the matrix and 
              the crystals at the same time. </p>

            <p>Avril Farley has been making crystal-glazed ceramics for four years. 
              Her workshop is a small, neatly organised outbuilding. The workroom 
              and its surrounding work areas are next to the cottage where Avril 
              lives with her husband, Ken. The setting is rural Gloucestershire 
              in the Royal Forest of Dean, England. The cottage and workshop stand 
              above a delightful sunny garden which slopes steeply down to a stream. 
              The slope and footbridge are the route up and down which all clay, 
              equipment and finished work must be portered. In the late 1780s 
              this cottage was a pub humorously named &#8216;The Sow with Three 
              Tits&#8217;. Here cider was made and served to the iron workers 
              who toiled immediately opposite, across the stream. </p>
            <p>Avril Farley&#8217;s production consists of thrown plates, bottles 
              and bowls. She prefers Limoges porcelain body, from Potterycrafts. 
              She uses a Mervyn Fitzwilliam Craftsman wheel. She does a small 
              amount of turning to make neat footrims which accommodate the inevitable 
              glaze run and grinding. The two 4 1/2 cu ft electric kilns are fired 
              at night for economy with the use of two Cambridge 401+ controllers. 
              She usually achieves two biscuit and one glaze per week, alternating 
              with one biscuit and two glaze firings.</p>

              are brushed on, thicker above than below to allow for considerable 
              glaze movement. Calcining the zinc oxide removes water and helps 
              to avoid flaking of the glaze. A binder, &#8216;CMC&#8217;, is used 
              to make the glaze less friable. Every pot is fired on a &#8216;catcher&#8217; 
              made to measure. Surplus run off glaze is contained by the &#8216;catcher&#8217; 
              which must be separated after firing. Glaze and foot are then ground 
              smooth. This is a demanding process requiring specialised grinders 
              for the particular shapes and a skilled operator who is efficiently 
              clad in protective clothing, goggles and helmet. Every firing contains

              at 1060&ordm;C for 30 minutes, then a rise to 1080&ordm;C again. 
              There may be as many as six pauses but Farley also likes to vary 
              the timing of of zinc silicate. These periods to give more interestingly 
              placed haloes.</p>
            <p>Farley declares her approach to ceramic chemistry was instinctive. 
              From a nonscientific early career she is now developing a firm understanding 
              of chemistry through methodical practice and application. She enjoys 
              the discipline which the creation of crystalline glazes demands. 
              In a detailed directive to herself, &#8216;The Learning Curve&#8217;, 
              she stipulates every practical rule steering a controlled course 
              through trial and error progress. </p>

            <p>Record keeping is unquestionable. Glaze making is precise and meticulous 
              with thorough attention to care of equipment. Firing records include 
              identification of all tests, positions in the kiln, weather (for 
              its influence on cooling rates), temperature readings and digital 
              pictures are stored. Suggestions for variations on every aspect 
              of the making follow with practical guidance for control of glaze 
              fusion, and ending with warnings against impatient kiln opening. 
              Avril Farley is currently experimenting with more materials based 
              on elements from the lanthanoid series sometimes called &#8216;rare 
              earths&#8217;. </p>
