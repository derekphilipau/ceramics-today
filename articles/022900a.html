      <p align="left"> The work of the department head at Sudan University, Professor 
        Salih El Zakir, has adhered to a meticulously executed Arabic style. One 
        quite successful alumnus is Yasir Mohammed. Yasir's elaborately formed 
        pieces are most often unglazed. Large sculptural vessels are slipcast, 
        with a clay body having no deflocculent. The plaster used for molds is 
        of a low quality typical in much of Africa but the addition of 4 percent 
        portland cement helps to give the molds strength.<br>

      <p><i>Left: At the Khorobhagarat kiln, a brick making team at work. These 
        soft mud bricks quickly lose their shape.</i> 
      <p> Across the White Nile from Khartoum, in neighbouring Omdurman, another 
        ceramic devotee is Dr Ahmed Hassan Hood. To financially diversify his 
        business making refractory brick, Dr Hood produces a line of decorative 
        planters and small ziers. As is often the case in Africa, where shared 
        information can be hard to come by, the artist must attempt to be a scientist, 
        and vice versa. Dr Hood is a chemical engineer turned ceramist. Remarkably, 
        with no prior experience other than research in books, he has begun production 
        of good quality kaolin firebrick fired to 1400° C. Dr Hood's oil-burning, 
        domed brick kiln was built through trial and error, and patience. His 
        own ceramic journey has been one of pure scientific inquiry: an acquired 
        understanding of what the local materials can do. 
      <p> Near El Obeid, at Khorobhagarat, the construction of a Hoffman kiln 
        is a new project of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Firing 
        with heavy fuel oil, an express objective for this kiln is to reduce the 
        amount of wood fuel used for brick making in the area. I gave brick forming 
        teams at the kiln some assistance in using a drier mix of clay. With this 
        improvement, the kiln's managers were able to achieve improved stacking 
        in the kiln, resulting in better firing, stronger bricks and reduced fuel 
        consumption.

      <p> Because success in marketing is closely dependent on good technical 
        skills, in 1992 in the United States, I founded Appropriate Technology 
        Transfer in Ceramics (ATTIC). My aim was to provide services and technical 
        information to aspiring ceramists. We distributed two do-it-yourself manuals. 
        I wrote one on making models and moulds and another on how to build and 
        operate an inexpensive air-release ceramic press. We also made available 
        25 out-of-print technical papers which give the basics on various ceramic 
        processes and materials. ATTIC flourished assisting ceramists from the 
        United States and many other countries, proving that what is appropriate 
        is needed everywhere and is forever relevant. Appropriate technology is 
        not only applicable to remote villages in the heart of Africa. 
      <p> A similar body of information exists in back copies of The American 
        Ceramic Society Bulletin, also from the 1930s to the '60s but the demand 
        has not warranted reprinting. Only more recent information, primarily 
        on advanced ceramics, is being rendered to electronic libraries. In the 
        1970s, my initial pursuit of ceramic information started in Liberia, West 
        Africa. There I worked for 11 years in glass art and I dabbled in ceramics. 
        I began to notice that Liberia and neighbouring countries appeared stuck 
        in a cycle of raw materials exportation and finished goods importation. 
        For export they could mine iron, cut timber and tap rubber, but they manufactured 
        little. In Liberia, I walked every day on a path of kaolin, yet I had 
        to import firebricks for our kiln. Although Liberians and their neighbours 
        were melting and casting iron and other metals in the 19th century, it 
        seems that the metal products imported from Europe and the United States 
        supplanted local products. The metal-working industries closed and craft 
        traditions were lost. When I saw this, I decided glass art was too ornamental 
        for me and I could work in ceramics to change these situations for the 
        better.
