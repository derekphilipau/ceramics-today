              Singh</a></b> (1898-1995) graduated from the Prince of Wales College 
              in Jammu (now Pakistan) with a Bachelor's degree in geology and 
              chemistry in 1918. After accepting a job at a brick factory run 
              by his father&#8217;s friend Ram Singh Kabuli, he became an apprentice 
              with Abdullah Musalmaan, a descendant of a famous line of Pathan 
              potters who came to India in the thirteenth century. In 1919 Singh 
              went to Japan to study industrial ceramics. There, he met Yanagi 
              Soetsu, Bernard Leach, Tomimoto Kenkichi and Shoji Hamada. 
            <p>On his return to India, he established a workshop at his old pottery, 
              which became known for its Persian copper-blue tiles. In 1927 he 
              founded the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society (AIFACS). He 
              was head of the Government Pottery Institute at Ambala in Jammu 
              from the late 1930s until 1952. Singh then returned to his old pottery 
              works, renaming it the <a href="http://www.potteryindia.com/GlazedPottery/delhiblue.html"><b>Delhi 
              Blue Art Pottery</b></a> (now the Delhi Blue Pottery Trust). Delhi 
              Blue tiles were used in many public buildings in India. In 1974 
              Gurucharan Singh was awarded the Sahitya Kala Parishad's best artist 
              award and in 1991 he received the Padmashree from the President 
              of India for his contribution to the field of ceramics. He is also 
              known as the author of <i>Pottery in India</i>, published in 1979.

              Singh</a></b> studied pottery with his father Gurcharan at the Delhi 
              Blue Art Pottery from 1956-1959. He also studied with Bernard Leach 
              and Geoffrey Whiting. In 1960 he joined his father at his pottery. 
              In 1976 Mansimran Singh assisted in establishing the <a href="http://www.lalitkala.gov.in/"><b>Lalit 
              Kala Akademi</b></a>'s (National Academy of Art) pottery studios 
              in Delhi. Later he held workshops for the academy in Lucknow. 
            <p>In 1984 he and his wife Mary, also a potter, moved to Andretta, 
              Himachal Pradesh, where they make functional, glazed earthenware 
              and conduct three-month long training courses.
