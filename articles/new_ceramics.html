              </b>The German magazine <i>Neue Keramik</i> goes international
 <p><img src="../images/clickable.gif" width="85" height="54">
            <p>In January this year a quiet transformation took place. A new kid 
              arrived on the block. The German Magazine <i>Neue Keramik</i> launched 
              its new international, English language version <i><b><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/start/m-eng-start.html">New
              Ceramics</a></b></i>, as well as a fully English language complimentary 
              website. 
            <p>Does the international ceramics community really need another English 
              language magazine, you might ask. Is it worth competing against 
              such heavy-weights as Ceramics Monthly (USA), Studio Ceramics (UK) 
              or Ceramics Art &amp; Perception (Australia)?
            <p><i>New Ceramics</i> introduces a fresh perspective into the world 
              of Anglo-Saxon ceramics magazines and literature. It not only offers 
              a European perspective, it offers a <i>continental</i> European 
              perspective. While offering a central European outlook, <i>New Ceramics</i> 
              is at the same time decidedly international. The German version 
              was already moving more in this direction.
            <p><b><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current-1-05.html"><img src="images/new_ceramics/Titel_01_2005-g-en.jpg" width="154" height="202" border="0" align="left">Issue
              1</a></b> (Jan/Feb 2005) featured artists portraits of such international 
              luminaries as Nino Caruso (Italy), Jiangshen Li (China) and Marta 
              Nagy (Hungary). Add to this reports on the 1st International Ceramic 
              Journal Editors' Symposium in China and the International Academy 
              of Ceramics General Assembly in Korea in 2004, plus exhibition reports 
              from around the world and you have an interesting mix. Add to this 
              the German perspective with a fascinating series on historical stoneware 
              from the Rhineland region and an equally interesting article on 
              Anagama firing at the Institute of Ceramics &amp; Glass in the ceramics 
              center of H&ouml;hr-Grenzhausen. Some of these names and terms may 
              be familiar to you. If they're not, you've got even more to learn 
              and discover. Reading these articles will broaden your horizon and 
              may give new inspiration, if you are a maker.
            <p><b><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current-2-05.html">Issue
              2</a></b> (March/April 2005) featured artists Shao-Ting Ju (Taiwan), 
              Rene Reichenbach (Germany), Sidsel Hamun (Norway) and others. A 
              highlight of this issue was a transcript of a talk by American ceramist 
              Gerry Williams on the goal of ceramic journals and their influence 
              on the field, as well as a report on Picasso's ceramics and another 
              on Turkish faience motifs.
            <p><b><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current-3-05.html">Issue
              3</a></b> (May/June 2005) again has that international perspective 
              - featured artists included Yikyung Kim (Korea), Prezemyslaw Lasak 
              (Poland), Nan Beyer (Finland) and Gabriele Koch (UK/Germany). An 
              article by Jane Perryman focused on the over life-size Aiyanaar 
              horses of Tamil Nadu, which was of particular interest, as Ceramics 
              Today also featured an article on the same topic by Ron Du Bois 
              around the same time.

            <p><b><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current-4-05.html">Issue
              4</a></b> (June/July 2005) features my favorite cover: a cropped 
              detail of works by German ceramists Rita Ternes and Thomas Naethe. 
              This issue features Vietnamese ceramist Dao Droste, German ceramist 
              Kyra Spieker and others. In the 'Forum' section, Garth Clarks presents 
              a paper on <i>Ceramic History and the Avant-Garde</i> (an excerpt 
              from his 'must-have' anthology of writing <i>Shards</i>). The exhibition 
              section features reports on NCECA Bltimore, the Richard Bampi Prize 
              (a major German ceramics prize) and a report on masterpieces of 
              Japanese pottery in a major German collection (including Koie Ryoji, 
              Tsujimura Shiro etc.).
            <p><a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current.html"><img src="images/new_ceramics/Titel_05_2005-m_en.jpg" width="154" height="202" border="0" align="left"></a>The
              current <a href="http://www.neue-keramik.de/english/magazine/m-current.html"><b>Issue
              5</b></a> features portraits of Frenchman Franck Rousseaux, Irish 
              potter Claire Curneen, Dutchman Mels Boom and Petra Bittl, who was 
              recently awarded the State Prize for Crafts From North-Rhine Westphalia, 
              Germany. The 'Forum' includes an intriguing article on <i>Einstein 
              and Ceramics</i>, by former editor Gustav Weiss, while the 'Exhibitions' 
              section covers the 3rd World Ceramic Biennale 2005 in Korea and 
              Ceramic Art London 2005.
            <p>By launching an English version of the German magazine <i>Neue 
              Keramik</i>, Bernd Pfannkuche has taken a bold step. It's a gamble, 
              but one I hope will pay off. Today's world is becoming increasingly 
              borderless and international. We see the Australian ceramics magazine 
              being distributed in the USA, the Greek magazine also publishing 
              in English (offering however a totally different perspective) and 
              any number of online resources reaching out to an international 
              audience.
            <p><i>New Ceramics</i> has a place in this scheme of things and I 
              am confident it will carve out a niche for itself in the world of 
              English language magazines. Not in competition, but complimentary. 
              If you still have doubts, give it a go. You won't be disappointed.
