              It Throwing?</font></b> <br>
              An investigation into the origin of words, by Dennis Krueger 
            <p><font size="-2">Images courtesy Edouard Bastarache.</font>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo5.jpg" width="180" height="120" align="left"></font>When 
              a person changes professions one carries the knowledge and experience 
              of the profession left behind into the new profession. In my case 
              the old profession was German language and literature; the new one, 
              pottery. I knew that language, like any other attribute of man, 
              is in a constant state of flux. Anyone who tries to read Chaucer, 
              or even Shakespeare, in its original form can see the enormous changes 
              that have occurred in English just since the Middle Ages. I knew 
              that language has a history just as political events or personalities 
              do, and I knew that most European languages can be traced back to 
              Indo-European roots that actually predate writing. </p>
            <p>When I first began making pots, I was naturally curious about the 
              new words I was learning - words which didn't seem to make much 
              sense. Until then, I had thought grog was a rum drink, slip was 
              something 'twixt the cup and the lip, and I wondered why on earth 
              wheel work was called throwing. Since I had the skills in etymology 
              to answer these questions myself, I eventually got around to doing 
              just that. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo7.jpg" width="142" height="208" align="left"></font>One 
              of my initial discoveries was of great personal interest. In graduate 
              school, I had been told by one of my professors that Krueger means 
              country innkeeper. Krug (not Stein) is the German word for beer 
              mug and a Krueger is the man who serves beer mugs. This is indeed 
              one definition. The other is that a Krueger is the man who makes 
              beer mugs: Krueger means potter. No wonder I had such an affinity 
              for clay! When I finally explored a larger number of potter's words, 
              some patterns began to emerge. Within the flux of language some 
              areas change rapidly and some resist change. Much of the specialized 
              vocabulary of pottery has resisted change for the simple reason 
              that the activities and objects described have changed so little 
              over the centuries. </p>
            <p>I shall begin with the words that appear in Old English (500-1050 
              A.D.), although many have even older roots. </p>
            <p>Clay appears in Old English as claeg and means exactly the same 
              thing it does today. To find the root for clay, we have to go back 
              to the Indo-European root *glei- meaning to glue, paste, stick together. 
            </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo8.jpg" width="180" height="122" align="left"></font>To 
              throw. Potters at Marshall Pottery in Texas describe their work 
              at the potters wheel as turning. They understand only the modern 
              meaning of to throw and do not use it to describe their work. However, 
              the Old English word thrawan from which to throw comes, means to 
              twist or turn. Going back even farther, the Indo-European root *ter- 
              means to rub, rub by twisting, twist, turn. The German word drehen, 
              a direct relative of to throw, means turn and is used in German 
              for throwing. Because the activity of forming pots on the wheel 
              has not changed since Old English times, the word throw has retained 
              its original meaning in the language of pottery but has developed 
              a completely different meaning in everyday usage. Those who say 
              they throw pots are using the historically correct term. Those who 
              say they turn pots are using more current language. Both are saying 
              the same thing. </p>
            <p>Glaze and glass come from the same root - the Old English root 
              glaer, meaning amber. Amber, as everyone knows, is a &quot;pale 
              yellow, sometimes reddish or brownish, fossil resin of vegetable 
              origin, translucent, brittle.&quot; (The Random House Dictionary 
              of the English Language, 1967). For the English-speaking world, 
              glass - and with it glaze - must have come into use at a time when 
              amber was a commonly recognized substance. Since amber was a substance 
              much like glass in appearance, the word for amber - glaer - was 
              transferred to the new substance. </p>
            <p>Kiln derives from the Latin word culina, meaning kitchen or cookstove. 
              Culina was introduced to England by the Romans in the first and 
              second centuries A.D., managed to survive the Anglo-Saxon invasion 
              of the fifth and sixth centuries, and showed up in the Old English 
              forms cylene or cyline, meaning large oven. Culina has retained 
              this specialized meaning ever since, and nowhere is it used to denote 
              kitchen. Its cousin, culinary, is of much more recent origin. Its 
              first written appearance was in 1638, and its closeness to the classical 
              Latin form indicates that it was reintroduced to English by sixteenth 
              century humanists. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo12.jpg" width="141" height="210" align="left"></font>Slip 
              has a history like that of to throw. It derives from the Old English 
              word slype, a relative of slop, and its original meaning is liquid 
              mud. Common usage retains a hint of this meaning in the verb to 
              slip, and in the common adjective slippery. As a noun, however, 
              slip means liquid mud only to potters and ceramists. Everyday language 
              has completely lost the meaning of slip as it is used in pottery. 
            </p>
            <p>Pot, potter, pottery. These words do not show up in England until 
              late Old English or early Middle English (1050-1450). There are 
              forms of the word pot in Old Frisian, Middle Dutch, Middle Low German, 
              Old Norse, Swedish, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. However, no 
              forms exist in Old High German or Middle High German. This suggests 
              that the word pot comes from some vulgar Latin derivative of the 
              classical Latin verb potare, to drink. Medieval Latin uses pottus 
              for drinking cup; classical Latin uses potorium for drinking cup; 
              and classical Greek uses poterion for drinking cup. The Oxford English 
              Dictionary, however, disputes this etymology and claims that the 
              origin of pot is unknown. Since the former explanation is better 
              than no explanation, I shall opt for it. Pot comes eventually from 
              the Latin word for drinking cup. It seems likely that the words 
              pot and potter were introduced to England at the time of the Norman 
              conquest (1066). Pottery seems to be a much later addition to English 
              than pot or potter. Apparently it was adopted from the French poterie 
              in the fifteenth century. By the way, the -er of potter means one 
              who makes, and the -ery means the place where. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo15.jpg" width="139" height="211" align="left"></font>Since 
              pot, potter, and pottery come into English relatively late, it is 
              logical to assume that they displaced another set of words prior 
              to their arrival. After casting about for a number of possibilities, 
              I hit upon crock, crocker, and crockery, and decided to see how 
              old they are. Crock goes back to Old English crocc - crocca meaning 
              earthenware pot or pitcher - and is related to Icelandic krukka, 
              Danish krukke, Swedish kruka, Old High German krog or kruog, Middle 
              High German kruoc, and German krug! The ultimate origin of crock 
              is unknown. There is a written record of the word crock, dating 
              from about 1000 A.D. Crocker is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary 
              as &quot;potter.&quot; The earliest written record of crocker occurs 
              around 1315. The existence of Crocker today as a surname is strong 
              evidence that it is quite old. Crockery is defined by the Oxford 
              English Dictionary as &quot;crocks, or earthenware vessels, collectively 
              earthenware, especially domestic utensils of earthenware.&quot; 
              Its earliest written appearance was in 1755. This suggests to me 
              that until the arrival of the Normans in 1066, crock and crocker 
              were the common Anglo-Saxon terms for pot and potter which were 
              pushed aside by the new terms imported by the French-speaking Normans 
              in 1066, but which lived on with a specialized meaning. Crockery, 
              however, seems to be a much later coinage, probably formed by analogy 
              to other nouns ending in -ery. Crockery did not come into common 
              use until the eighteenth century. </p>
            <p>Four words whose origins are unknown, but which are probably quite 
              old, are to wedge, bat, grog, and saggar. Their monosyllabic forms 
              would seem to indicate Anglo-Saxon roots, but no evidence exists 
              to prove that one way or the other. Even the Oxford English Dictionary 
              sheds no light on their derivation. </p>
            <p>To wedge. The Oxford English Dictionary contains the following 
              under to wedge: </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo18.jpg" width="143" height="214" align="left"></font>wedge, 
              v. in 7 wage (of obscure origin; the modern form is probably less 
              correct than the earlier wage but cf wedge Sb 4). Trans. to cut 
              (wet clay) into masses and work them by kneading and throwing down, 
              in order to expel air bubbles. 1686 Plot. Staffordish. 123 (Potter's 
              clay) is brought to the waging board, where it is slit into flat, 
              thin pieces . . . This being done, they wage it, i.e., knead or 
              mould it like bread. <br>
              The latter part of this entry contains the date, 1686, of the oldest 
              written record of the word. I suspect that the word is much older 
              and that if it is related to wage, it may simply mean something 
              like make, as in the expression &quot;to wage war,&quot; but that 
              is just speculation on my part. </p>
            <p>Bat. On bat there is even less information than on wedge. The Oxford 
              English Dictionary defines bat as a &quot;lump, a piece of certain 
              substances&quot; and calls its origin obscure. </p>
            <p>Grog. As used by potters, grog must be a figment of our imaginations 
              because it is not listed in any of the major dictionaries I consulted. 
              (It is found in An Illustrated Dictionary of Ceramics.) The Oxford 
              English Dictionary lists only the meaning for the rum drink. Perhaps 
              if potters who read this would send sharp letters of protest to 
              the editors of Random House, Oxford English, and other dictionaries, 
              this deplorable situation could be corrected. </p>
            <p>Saggar. Saggar seems to be a corruption of safeguard. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo21.jpg" width="180" height="118" align="left"></font>Many 
              words are derived from the names of the places they are found, or 
              from the way they are made or used. Ball clay is a type of clay 
              found in Dorset and Devon in England, so named because the clay 
              was cut into balls weighing about thirty pounds. Bentonite is named 
              after Fort Benton, Montana, where it was first mined. China is named 
              after the country of its origin. Kaolin is of Chinese origin and 
              derives from kao ling, meaning high hill - the place it was first 
              found. Faience, the tin-glazed earthenware, was made at Faenza, 
              Italy, in the sixteenth century. maiolica is named after the island 
              of Majorca (formerly maiolica), which was a transfer point for work 
              produced in Valencia, Spain, and exported to Italy. Mishima may 
              derive from the radiating character of certain almanacs made at 
              Mishima, Japan, or it may have been acquired by association with 
              the island of Mishima where the ware was transshipped from Korea. 
              Potash - potassium carbonate - was originally produced by burning 
              wood in a pot. The Dutch coined the term potasch in 1598, and it 
              entered English in 1648. Raku means enjoyment, and the ware takes 
              its name from a seal engraved with this word, which was used to 
              mark early pieces. It is also the name of a series of potters - 
              Raku I-XIV. </p>
            <p>The derivations of some words that came into the language in the 
              Middle English period (1050-1450), or later, are quite amusing.

            <p>Porcelain. Chinese porcelain was reputedly first introduced to 
              Europe by Marco Polo via Italy. The Italians therefore had the privilege 
              of giving it a European name (although some say it was the Portuguese 
              who named it). They called it porcellana. In French it became porcelaine. 
              The English took it over from the French and dropped the final -e. 
              The Italians probably kept the origin of the word a secret; it is 
              unlikely that the English would have had anything to do with it 
              otherwise. Italian porcellana originally denoted the sea shell concha 
              veneris. This Venus' conch shell is hard and white, and perhaps 
              the Italians named the Chinese ware porcellana because they thought 
              the shell was ground up and used in the body, or because of the 
              similarity in hardness and whiteness. More interestingly, the word 
              for the seashell itself comes from the word porca, pork. The shell 
              was so named because of its similarity to the genitalia of the sow.

              is an equally interesting word. Most of the dictionaries say that 
              the name comes from the character Celadon in Honore d'Urfe's novel 
              Astree. d'Urfe for his part is said to have borrowed the name from 
              the Latin poet Ovid. The character in d'Urfe's novel always wore 
              pale green ribbons. The connection seems tenuous at best, and no 
              one can explain how the name was transferred to a pale green Chinese 
              glaze. An Illustrated Dictionary of Ceramics offers this much more 
              likely derivation: &quot;The name is probably a corruption of Salah-ed-din 
              (Saladin), Sultan of Egypt, who sent forty pieces of this ware to 
              Nur-ed-din, Sultan of Damascus, in 1171.&quot; </p>
            <p>Stein. When I was an undergraduate student at the University of 
              Freiburg in the Black Forest area of West Germany, I remember being 
              asked by a friend back home to send her a beer mug. I went to a 
              shop and in my best German (which at the time was none too good) 
              I asked for a Bierstein. The saleswoman kept asking me to speak 
              English. I kept refusing because I was determined to speak only 
              German. She only figured out what I wanted when I pointed to the 
              object. Later, I realized that Bierkrug is the correct word, and 
              that Stein means stone. How the German word for stone has come to 
              mean mug in America is a mystery to me. I still feel embarrassment 
              for not having known the difference that day in Freiburg. </p>

              borrowings from other languages are common in the English language 
              for pottery. We have already seen kaolin, mishima, and raku. Some 
              others are ceramics, engobe, sgraffito, and temmoku. Ceramic is 
              of recent French origin. It was borrowed from ceramique in the nineteenth 
              century. Its root is the Greek word keram(os), potter's clay. Engobe 
              derives from the French en- plus gober which means, literally, to 
              gulp, take in the mouth, hence to coat something with saliva. From 
              this original meaning to its current sense is not too great a leap. 
              Its earliest appearance in written English was in 1857 in Birch's 
              Ancient Pottery. Sgraffito is borrowed from Italian and derives 
              ultimately from the Greek graphein, to write or scratch. Temmoku 
              is used to describe black-glazed stoneware cups and bowls made during 
              the Sung dynasty (960-1280) at Chien-an (Honan province), China, 
              and so called by the Japanese who sought the ware for use in the 
              tea ceremony. I do not know its meaning or origin. </p>
            <p>Modern technology has introduced a number of new words to the language 
              of pottery. Opax, superpax, and zircopax are all based on opacifier. 
              Fiberfrax is from fiber and refractory, kaowool from kaolin and 
              wool. While these are brand names, they are often also used as common 
              names. </p>
            <p><font size="4"><img src="images/bastarache_demo/demo30.jpg" width="143" height="214" align="left"></font>Finally, 
              I decided to see where art and craft would lead me. Art goes back 
              to the Indo-European root *ar-, to join. Craft derives from the 
              Indo-European root *ger-, to twist, turn. I was tempted to try to 
              make something out of the difference but gave up the idea, knowing 
              that it would be futile. </p>
            <p>In summary, the potter's language has a core of words that go back 
              to Old English roots, and beyond, which have changed little in form 
              or meaning over the centuries because the objects and activities 
              have changed little. Many new words have been added - largely from 
              foreign sources - describing new techniques, new bodies, new technology, 
              or new objects so that there is a continuous enlargement of the 
              core vocabulary: a sign of a healthy and vigorous craft.<br>
