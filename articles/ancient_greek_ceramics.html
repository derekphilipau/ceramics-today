                  Importance of Greek Pottery</h3>
                <p align="left">The pottery of the ancient Greeks is of specific 
                  interest to us as Potters. We can study its stylistic origins 
                  and development of forms, slip decoration and technical expertise 
                  in making, decoration and firing. Almost all of their techniques 
                  are worth checking out as possibly relevant and useful in your 
                  work.<br clear-all>
                </p>
                <p align="left">However, in the wider field of History of Art, 
                  Greek Pottery is also of considerable value for the light it 
                  sheds on the development of Greek pictorial art, which is in 
                  effect the beginning of European Drawing and Painting.<br clear-all>
                </p>
                <h3 align="left" class=second>Painted Pottery is Main Source of 
                  Information</h3>
                <p align="left">Because fired clay pottery is highly durable - 
                  and few or no Greek works in wood, textile, or wall painting 
                  have survived - the painted decoration of this pottery has become 
                  the main source of information about the process whereby Greek 
                  artists gradually solved the many problems of representing three&nbsp;dimensional 
                  objects and figures on a flat or curved surface. <br clear-all>
                </p>
                <h3 align="left" class=second>Many Greek Pots Have Survived</h3>
                <p align="left">The large number of surviving examples is also 
                  the result of a much wider reliance on pottery vessels in a 
                  period when other materials were expensive or unknown. The Greeks 
                  used pottery vessels for storage, transport or drinking. Smaller 
                  pots were used as drinking cups and very small ones made for 
                  perfumes and ointments.<br clear-all>

                  Pottery &amp; Figure Painting</h3>
                <p align="left">From at least 1700BC the many Hellenic tribes 
                  had migrated southwards through what we now call Greece. They 
                  gradually came to dominate the Aegean region, led by the kings 
                  of Mycenae under a loose confederacy of lesser chieftains.<br clear-all>
                </p>
                <p align="left"><a href="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch6793s.gif"><img src="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch6793th.gif" width="42" height="50" alt="" border="0" align="LEFT" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">004

                  On each side there is a stylized scene of warriors and a chariot 
                  amidst stylized flowers and marine motifs. It was found in a 
                  tomb in Kourion in Greece. Pots with warlike scenes like this 
                  were popular and often made for export.<br clear-all>
                  <a href="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch6795crs.jpg"><img src="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch6795crth.jpg" width="74" height="50" alt="Click for Detail" border="" align="LEFT" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">004a

                  with dotted or diamond shaped patterns<br clear-all>
                </p>
                <p align="left">During this early period these Greek tribes derived 
                  much of their culture from the Minoans on Crete, but in 1400BC 
                  they overthrew the Minoan kingdom. A common Mycenaean-Minoan 
                  culture spread throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. But still 
                  more Hellenic people continued to press down from the North. 
                  The powerful Dorians were the last Greek tribe to sweep down 
                  the peninsula in the eleventh century BC.<br clear-all>

                <h3 align="left" class=first>Epic Myths based on Actual Events</h3>
                <p align="left">The Trojan War, celebrated in the Iliad and the 
                  Odyssey of <a href="homer.html">Homer</a>, 
                  was probably an embroidered episode in this expansion or invasion 
                  by the Greeks into the islands and Asia Minor, probably about 
                  1200-1150BC. But, about 1100BC, the Mycenean Kings were in turn 
                  overwhelmed by a final wave of tribal invaders from the north 
                  - the Dorians - formidable Greek warriors with superior swords 
                  made of iron. These Dorians slowly blotted out the old Minoan-Mycenaean-Helladic 
                  civilization of the Aegean.<br clear-all>
                </p>
                <p align="left">The succession of wars and the turmoil which followed 
                  kept a once-flourishing civilization practically in caves. For 
                  at least half a century or more the pottery production in much 
                  of the mainland was reduced to rough, shoddily-made pottery. 
                  However, by the second half of the 11th century, improvements 
                  in pottery making suggest that life in some areas seems to have 
                  become more settled again. Pot makers gradually grew into artists 
                  once again. Eventually, a new Iron-Age farming culture began 
                  to evolve in Greece; a culture with a common language. The Greek 
                  nation was born, and gradually a style of art and architecture 
                  developed. <br clear-all>
                </p>
                <p align="left">In the 9th and 8th centuries, before written accounts, 
                  ballad singers wove the facts and legends of their early history 
                  into the Mythic Epic Stories of Gods and Heroes. Later they 
                  were written down or drawn as images on pots to become part 
                  of the foundation of <a href="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hellenic.html">Greek 
                  (or Hellenic) culture</a>. The Art and architecture created 
                  was to inspire artists and designers for ages to come.</p>

                  The existence of pots like this shows that the basic making, 
                  throwing and firing techniques recovered quickly after the turmoil. 
                  Simple geometric shapes and symbols soon began to reappear but 
                  often rearranged into a distinctly new style. Clearly the potter's 
                  wheel and probably a compass were needed to produce such regular 
                  banded lines and the perfect circles.<br clear-all>

                <h3 align="left" class=second>Early (or Proto) Geometric Pottery 
                </h3>
                <p align="left">This first Greek style of pottery decoration has 
                  been called the Geometric Style because the earliest examples 
                  show designs based on circles, arcs, triangles, and wavy lines. 
                  The earliest stage of simple geometric patterns is often called 
                  Early or &quot;Proto&quot;-Geometric and signals the reawakening 
                  of technical proficiency and a spirit of creativity amongst 
                  the Hellenic communities. <br clear-all>
                <p align="left"><a href="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch651bms.gif"><img src="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch651bmth.gif" width="46" height="75" alt="" border="0" align="LEFT" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">007

                  ht:40cm BM.</font><br>
                  The design elements are carefully placed in horizontal bands 
                  on significant parts of the vase, mainly at the shoulder or 
                  belly. The concentric circles were perhaps painted using a compass 
                  and multiple brushes. The lower portion of the jar was usually 
                  either left plain or painted in a solid black slip inherited 
                  from Bronze Age artists. (Notice that, by accident, part of 
                  the black band of slip has turned red(See Potters Notes, later 
                  on). Such pottery was now becoming better made, there is a new 
                  ability to discipline hand and eye. A new art is developing 
                  out of a ruined civilization.<br>
                  Large Storage Jars of this amphora shape, with handles attached 
                  to the neck, were also used for the cremated remains of men 
                  and boys. <br clear-all>

                  On this somewhat later pot there is more black slip and more 
                  decoration. There is a checker band on the shoulder, zig-zag 
                  lines and then a broad wavy line lower down. As yet the patterns 
                  are quite abstract and simple. Other devices such as the meander(key 
                  pattern), triangle, herringbone, and swastika will soon begin 
                  to appear. Notice that this pot also shows the accidental change 
                  from black to red of a broad band of slip(See Potters Notes).<br>

                  <br>
                  By about 900BC the Geometric style of decoration had become 
                  much more refined. The shapes are now more slender and the contours 
                  taut. Black bands increasingly dominate the surface but also 
                  frame alternate buff colored areas crowded with rich and carefully 
                  drawn linear patterns. These patterns and motifs are more complex 
                  than the Proto-Geometric style and the overall effect is now 
                  much richer.<br>
                  <a href="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch601dts.jpg"><img src="http://www.acss09.hemscott.net/hgrafs06/ch601dtth.jpg" width="89" height="50" alt="Click for Detail" border="" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="2"></a><font size="-3"  color="#0000ff">009a

                  This zone around the belly between the two handles is the center 
                  of attention; divided into rectangular shapes and embellished 
                  with a variety of patterns. The simple circles have been replaced 
                  with much more complex forms, plus the zigzag, cross-hatched 
                  triangles and some new elements, the meander and swastika. These 
                  sharply linear patterns in dark paint upon light ground suggest

                  This is a large funeral monument. The decoration consists largely 
                  of bands of geometric patterns, particularly the meander, checker 
                  and triangles. With increasing trade with towns on the Palestine 
                  coast and Egypt, Greek potters looked eastward for new decorative 
                  ideas and here we can see a radical new idea in the Geometric 
                  style which enriches the bands of abstract pattern: bands of 
                  animals and birds probably inspired by the impressed ornament 
                  on Syrian metalware jugs and other vessels, but now lines of 
                  brush painted images full of character. Each row placed in a

                  The animal friezes are now confined to the marginal zone of

                  a new idea painted in a prime position: an impressive pictorial

                  The scene is placed at the jar's widest point, alongside the

                  flanked on either side by a row of mourners. All the figures 
                  are seen as the sum of geometrized parts - upper bodies becoming 
                  triangular, arms becoming straight or bent lines. Figures were 
                  invariably portrayed from the side, i.e., in profile, but front

                  a funeral couch set on tall legs; the pall is of checker pattern; 
                  on either side stand the mourners with upraised arms: beneath 
                  the couch are four figures, two kneeling and two seated on stools. 
                  A small figure on the right, perhaps a wife or child, stands 
                  in a pose of misery alongside the bier. Empty spaces continue 
                  to be filled with strips of zig-zag pattern, stars, circles

                  Gradually the pottery painters soften the angular figures of 
                  humans and animals. By the late 8th century BC the figure painting 
                  is beginning to become as or more important than the patterns 
                  and banding. Here figure painting dominates, framed and made 
                  more impressive by the intricate meander or key pattern around 
                  the rim above and the bold black banding and zigzag patterns

                  the scene as naturalistically as we do now. In all the figures 
                  the complex joining and rounded shape of hips and thighs is 
                  glossed over in order to arrive at two legs which can march 
                  in the same direction! As a general rule, in this early Hellenic 
                  style, the size of the figure usually denotes its importance.<br clear-all>

                  The wife and child are shown twice, this may indicate different 
                  functions. Their lesser importance in the scene is emphasized 
                  by their smaller size. Traditional ways of representing things 
                  did change when the situation demanded it. Although of lesser 
                  importance still, the row of mourners needed, for design reasons, 
                  to be big enough to fill the height of the panel.(see full image) 
                  A row of tiny figures would not have seemed correct. As yet 
                  all these images are perhaps symbols rather than images. But 
                  changes were on the way. Notice the decorators still feel the 
                  need to fill empty spaces with various patterns and motifs. 
                  Sometimes called the &quot;horror of the vacuum&quot;, this

                  Looking now across to the Eastern Seaboard of the Mediterranean 
                  and the islands nearby. During the turmoil of the previous centuries, 
                  many Cretan and Greek refugees had found sanctuary along this 
                  coast or on islands like Rhodes. As stability returned to the 
                  region, normal life and trading became possible. Colonies became 
                  established and pottery exports grew. The decoration on these 
                  &quot;East Greek&quot; pots shows the lasting influence of the 
                  Minoans. <br clear-all>

                  the Greek world, on the eastern side of the Aegean world the 
                  pottery decoration was based more on the spirals, curvilinear

                  During the late 8th and early 7th centuries BC the Greeks found 
                  a growing market for their useful pottery in the coastal cities 
                  of Syria and Palestine and even into the interior of Western 
                  Asia. The Egyptians too bought Greek pots. Apart from any food 
                  and spices that came back to Greece from these eastern cities, 
                  fine jewelry, decorated metal vessels, ivory carvings and woven 
                  fabrics also were traded in return. The images of birds and 
                  animals on these Greek pots made in Rhodes were probably based 
                  on Syrian and Egyptian designs. <br clear-all>

                  Greek trade with the older cultures - coastal cities in Syria, 
                  Palestine and Egypt - was now considerable. They were quickly 
                  adapting their simple geometric patterns on their export pottery 
                  to the very different Eastern designs. This soon led to a growing

                  This "Orientalizing" phase is taken up on the Mainland of Greece 
                  by the great trading city of Corinth during the early part of 
                  the 7th century BC. Quality decorated pottery was highly valued 
                  abroad and, with their eyes on this export market, the Corinthians 
                  manufactured very small decorated pots that were suitable for 
                  shipment in large quantities. Shipped to the new colonies in 
                  Italy, Greece and Asia Minor, as tiny bottles(aryballoi), they

                  decoration which has the curvilinear style characteristic of 
                  the earlier Minoan Age. These free, flamboyant designs, so different

                  The local Corinthian clay was buff rather than red. Potters

                  earthenware clay to produce a superior black slip glaze to paint 
                  the birds, lions, monsters, etc. They then enhanced these silhouette 
                  designs by cutting fine incised lines through to expose the 
                  lighter body. This scratched line technique to show detail became 
                  very sophisticated. Often to increase the color range, a matt 
                  grape-purple iron slip was used - as in the reddish feathers

                    More Detail of Corinthian oil or perfume flask - Alabastron.

                    This even closer detail makes it possible to see the scraping 
                    effect of the needle-like scratches into the leather-hard 
                    clay. For example, notice the simple and effective way of 
                    defining the petals of the rosette. You can also see how the 
                    sharp scratch lines went on just a little bit beyond the edges 
                    of the rosette shapes.</p>
