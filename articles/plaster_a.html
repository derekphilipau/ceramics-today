              So Hard to Use</font><br>
              by Brian Crocker</strong></b></font>
            <b></b> 
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Quite some time ago a Potter Friend and I had a brief 
              discussion, at our Studio Potter's Club, about using Pottery Plaster, 
              he was setting up to make a clay slops drying container and knowing 
              that I had been a tutor in the Ceramic Design Dept., at the then 
              S.A.C.A.E. Underdale South Australia. He asked me a few questions 
              about Mold Making with Pottery Plaster. It was only then that I 
              realized how long ago it was since I had been involved with plaster.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was 1981 when I last taught students, scraps of 
              information came out of the memory bank bit by bit, with a few gaps 
              here and there, my friend said &quot; O.K. I've got some idea of 
              what you're on about&quot;.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>So I got into the Car and headed for the Hills and 
              home. Isn't it great the way driving gets the gray matter working; 
              it's like thinking of all the things you could have said in a discussion 
              <i>after the event</i>. I mentally sorted out the sequence and timing 
              of mixing and casting pottery plaster on the way home and when I 
              got there I gave him a phone call at the Club to add a few things.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>I'm sure I still wasn't as lucid as I should have 
              been, &quot;Oh yeah is that how it goes?&quot; was his reply.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>So out came the notes that were down in the cellar, 
              from my teaching days, out came the pottery plaster, model, cottles, 
              buckets etc., and I settled down to make a one piece sprig mold 
              from scratch. This cleared a lot of fog from the brain.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>And so from that exercise here are the basics of using 
              plaster and casting a Mold, I hope it will be of some help to you.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><img src="../images/plaster.jpg" alt="Plaster Mold" width="160" height="120" hspace="3" align="left">One 
              important point to start with, for the best results, -- USE ONLY 
              <b>FRESH POTTERY PLASTER</b> (no other plaster will do) it should 
              be &quot;NO OLDER&quot; THAN 6 MONTHS FROM A GOOD DRY BAG,, AND 
              USE ONLY CLEAN RAIN WATER or SOFTENED WATER. Sounds extreme? But 
              that's the way it works best.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Decide what you are going to use the mold for, because 
              this determines the water to <b>pottery plaster</b> percentage (%), 
              the more water, the more absorbency the plaster will have but also 
              the weaker it will be . </FONT></P>
            <B><FONT FACE="Arial">So here are a few percentages:</font></B> <ul>
              <li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial" align="JUSTIFY">Clay Slops Drying 
                8 - 9 kg of water to 10 kg of plaster. = 80 - 90 %</FONT></li>
              <li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial" align="JUSTIFY">Slip Casting Molds 
                7 - 8 kg &quot; 10 kg &quot; = 70 - 80 %Sprig Molds 7 - 8 kg 
                &quot; 10 kg &quot; = 70 - 80 </FONT></li>
              <li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial" align="JUSTIFY">Jigger / Jolley Molds 
                6 - 7 kg &quot; 10 kg &quot; = 60 - 70 </FONT></li>
              <li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial" align="JUSTIFY">Press Molds 6 - 7 
                kg &quot; 10 kg &quot; = 60 - 70 </FONT></li>
              <li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial" align="JUSTIFY">Case Molds 3 - 4 
                kg &quot; 10 kg &quot; = 30 - 40 </FONT></li>
            </ul>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now having decided, the next requirement is to make 
              a soap mixture of bar soap (the kind Grandma used to use, no color 
              no perfume no filler, as pure as you can buy, or it could eventually 
              attack the plaster and spoil the detail ) grate it into a bowl or 
              large glass jar, not a tin,, and add warm water [ 50 gm of grated 
              soap to 110 gm of warm water ] mix well and leave to soak and soften, 
              give an occasional stir over a day or two and add a <B>little warm 
              water</B> if it looks too thick, it has to be brushable with a brush 
              similar to a soft shaving brush. It is very important that there 
              are no lumps, spend time feeling the mixture with your fingers, 
              lastly pass it through a sieve.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b>NEVER USE GREASE, VASELENE, OILS OF &quot;ANY KIND&quot;, 
              OR WAXES,</b> they all clog the pores of the plaster. It is the 
              absorbency of the plaster ( the ability of the plaster to draw moisture 
              out from the clay ), that you require.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now after making sure the model is brushed {with a 
              large Artists Brush} to thoroughly clean it, soap up the model with 
              the prepared soap mixture. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>The model can be made of many materials, plaster, 
              pottery [ glazed or bisqued ] timber, plastic or metal etc., etc. 
              Brush on the soap gel, not too thick, feel it with your fingers 
              to be sure there are no lumps, let it dry a little and wipe off 
              any excess with another brush. <B>Let it dry thoroughly</B> then 
              burnish it with a cloth similar to an &quot; old &quot; child's 
              cotton nappy [diaper] ( no fluff or lint ) , don't use toweling, 
              it is abrasive and can remove the dry soap. Each time the model 
              is burnished there must be a shine created on the soap. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>Soap and burnish 3 to 4 times, but no more or it may 
              clog any detail.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>There are times when the detail on the model is so 
              fine and complex that a decision must be made regarding the number 
              of times to soap and burnish, it is best then to feel it with your 
              fingers to &quot;see&quot; if the detail is being rounded with the 
              soap. (Don't hesitate at any stage to wash off <b>all</b> the soap 
              let it dry and start all over again.)</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>When the soap is <B>thoroughly dry</B> give it a last 
              gentle shine, keep your fingers off the shine now, a good Pottery 
              Plaster can pick up even a finger print. Cover with a soft dry cloth, 
              not plastic, and leave to harden.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2><b><B>Now get &quot;all&quot; the equipment ready, 
              you will have no spare time once you start</b></b>, you need a timer 
              or clock, a weighing scale [ is it large enough? ], a clean dry 
              bucket for plaster [ old plaster or plaster dust will <I>seed</I> 
              the new mix and cause problems ], a bucket for water, a bucket for 
              slops and bubbles a dry bucket to rest the mixing tools in and a 
              clean dry bucket for mixing, a clean stirring paddle or a slow electric 
              drill fitted with a clean mixing propeller, a large spoon to skim 
              off bubbles a rubber hammer and something to pour the excess plaster 
              in, preferably another small shape to use as a sprig mold.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT SIZE=2>And last but not least the base to hold the model 
              and four cottles to retain the wet plaster, all soaped to prevent 
              the new plaster from sticking, also about 1 kg of soft clay to stop 
              up any gaps in the cottles.</FONT></P>
