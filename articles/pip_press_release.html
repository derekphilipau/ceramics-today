              Drysdale</b></font><br>
              </font>(March 2003)
            <p>&#8220;Only twenty years ago I was finishing my Undergraduate Degree 
              in Fine Arts&#8221; ,said Pippin, &#8220;who could have imagined 
              the journey life has taken in this relatively short time!&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Pippin Drysdale, Western Australian ceramicist, returned just last 
              week from a world trip that she describes as the &#8220;best trip 
              professionally that I could have imagined&#8221;. The journey encompassed 
              a highly successful solo exhibition organised by the Galerie Marianne 
              Heller at the Museum f&uuml;r Angewandtekunst in Frankfurt, followed 
              by visits to Denmark, the United States and Japan. Everywhere her 
              work was received with overwhelming enthusiasm. She felt that the 
              international world had made her welcome with open arms.</p>
            <p>Her new work &#8220;Tanami Traces&#8221; has sold very well indeed 
              and will appear in a number of Museums. Articles have appeared in 
              German and French magazines, including Neue Keramik, Januar/Februar 
              2003. She has invitations for international exhibitions and offers 
              of representation from credible galleries in the United States. 
            </p>
            <p>Most importantly she saw her work displayed at the new Museum of 
              Modern Art in Gifu, Japan, The Inaugural Exhibition: The Legacy 
              of Modern Ceramic Art. The Museum houses examples of world contemporary 
              ceramic expression and is the most important collection of its type 
              in Japan. Three Australian artists are represented.</p>
            <p>Last night Marianne Heller rang from Germany to say that she has 
              selected Pippin&#8217;s work as her sole artist to be exhibited 
              at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p>
            <p>The level of international reception is overwhelming. Pippin says 
              she feels she has evoked &#8220;Open Sesame&#8221; and a veritable 
              cave of opportunities awaits her. At the same time panic strikes. 
              Pippin&#8217;s work is hard won. It took her fourteen months of 
              solid work to produce the last body of work. Little of this remains. 
              In fact the last seventeen pots will be exhibited at the BMG Art 
              Gallery, Adelaide. More hard work beckons both for Pippin and her 
              colleague Warick Palmateer without whom she would be unable to produce 
              the beautiful forms, the canvases on which she depends.</p>
            <p>Pippin acknowledges the help given her by many people in this journey. 
              She acknowledges the enormous assistance given her by Australian 
              granting bodies that have allowed her the time to innovate, the 
              encouragement of Robert Bell now of the National Gallery; and Janet 
              Mansfield , a ceramist in her own right, publisher of Ceramics: 
              Art and Perception and countless others.</p>
            <p>Back, literally to the grindstone, more pots in the making. The 
              Tanami theme has proved such a success and it will continue to intrigue 
              Pippin. Tanami represents the acme of her Australian-ness. She feels 
              there is much to explore there still.</p>
            <p>Pippin has been described as a &#8220;painterly&#8221; artist on 
              numerous occasions, an expression that encapsulates her natural 
              flamboyance and intuitive decorative style. &#8220;Tanami&#8221; 
              is not about that. It is about a painstaking and time-greedy discipline; 
              a science of fine glazes, incised lines and careful workings that 
              create the essence of traceries in a constantly changing desert 
              landscape. Yet looking at the pots they are a testimony of the struggle 
              between a creator that is desperate to throw colour and form around 
              on a grand scale and the discipline of the application &#8211; a 
              struggle akin to nature itself.<br>
