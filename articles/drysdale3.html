            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="../images/potw/drysdale/drysdale5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/potw/drysdale/drysdale5_sm.jpg" alt="Enlargement opens in new window" width="120" height="186" border="0" align="left"></a>In 
              the Tanami series colors and surfaces are produced in a complex, 
              highly crafted process. First three or four layers of colored glazes 
              and stains are sprayed on the outside surface of the vessel. These 
              have been prepared with certain levels of density, transparency 
              and gravity induced running in mind though the final outcome is 
              always impossible to predict. The inside of the vessel is colored 
              by half filling it with colored glaze and swirling it round until 
              a perfectly graduated coloring is produced. An evenly colored inner 
              void in which form becomes a function of light is essential to the 
              overall presence of the work but this sublimely sensitive density 
              cannot be achieved with spraying alone, which leaves a dry powdery 
              effect.The groups of clusters of lines in crystalline vitrified 
              glazes moving roughly horizontally round each vessel are made by 
              applying color into incised lines after the initial spraying of 
              glazes. Using liquitex painting medium as a resist does this very 
              accurately. It is much more precise than wax or latex and burns 
              away without creating a vile odor or any other environmental problems. 
              It has the disadvantage, however, that it dries and spoils rather 
              quickly. The blades used for this work also wear out after a few 
              minutes work. Only a small patch of surface can be worked on at 
              a time, which can limit the form of the design. Once the surface 
              is incised, special dry brushes are used to brush out the groves 
              and to clean up the edges of the liquitex resist so that no ragged 
              fragments or particles affect the glaze. Then thick colored glazes, 
              almost a paste are rubbed into them. A single pot can take several 
              days to prepare and ‘ paint’ in this way. Sometimes a further transparent 
              glaze is rubbed over the surface. However, only one firing is possible 
              without risk. A Successfully fired pot is so vitreous it rings like 
              a bell.When Drysdale developed this technique she worked for several 
              weeks on shards doing all kinds of drawings but it eventually became 
              clear that different forms of ‘traces’ lines that resonate with 
              the form of the vessel made more sense. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Initially when I started to play with that 
                technique I created drawings that looked like cave frescos. From 
                that I suddenly though this would give me the ability to create 
                some lovely traces. The very title Tanami Traces came just from 
                my heart. </p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY">You’ve got to remember that I’ve never been able 
                to draw. I can’t draw I’ve never been able to draw bodies. I can’t 
                foreshorten anything. I ve got no sense of perspective. All that 
                has affected the way I see things. I see in a very abstract way. 
                I can’t really draw the landscape, I draw emotion and feeling 
                from the landscape; I think I always have.</p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY">The most realistic aspect of the landscape I 
                have done in the past is the use of the horizon line. To actually 
                make the commitment of a minute almost microscopic sensation of 
                the land as if one were looking through a microscope picking up 
                the little fragments or secrets and then representing that feeling 
                in this work is very satisfying.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            In firing the lines feather out or bleed slightly into the glazes 
            which themselves blossom and weep into the surrounding surface. 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="../images/potw/drysdale/drysdale6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/potw/drysdale/drysdale6_sm.jpg" alt="Vessel by P. Drysdale" width="120" height="176" border="0" align="left"></a>&quot;I 
              long to get that feathering or bleeding or that fusion in all the 
              works buts its very difficult, what happens is that all the stains 
              and colors produced have different degrees of melting in the firing, 
              some fuse, bleed more than others. When you are working with so 
              many colors you have to have cut pint for the flux that controls 
              the running temperatures you can’t have one running and one standing 
              stiff. It would be terrible mess.&quot;</p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">With the incise lines its nice to have strong lines 
              and variations of line to express different emotional responses 
              in relation to line fusing outwards, almost disappearing or coming 
              in strong but you cant control that.&quot;</p>
            <p>Even so Drysdale achieves a remarkable relation between the technical 
              possibilities of her art and landscape. Consider the way the glazes 
              thin out at the lip of each vessel during firing just like the sky 
              and land a the horizon one ‘process’ parallels another in this way 
              through out her new work. Technique and creative intuition could 
              not be more intimately balanced. </p>
