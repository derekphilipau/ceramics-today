              <p align="left"> <i>For an interview with Norwegian ceramist and 
                teacher Arne &Aring;se, a number of questions were prepared. These 
                included: Why did you choose to work in clay? What was your start? 
                And how did you develop your work until now? What would you like 
                to express with your work including your source of inspiration 
                and your intentions. Does the working process unique to ceramics, 
                that is, using exclusively clay as material, forming and firing, 
                have any particular significance in the making of your work? Do 
                you consider your work to be craft (applied art) or sculpture 
                (fine art) or pictorial art or none of these? I also suggested 
                that &Aring;se should feel free to give his idea or opinion on 
                Japanese ceramics, either in the traditional (tea ceramics) or 
                the avant-garde (more sculptural trend), as it related to his 
                own work. In replying &Aring;se began with some general comments.</i></p>
              <p align="left">Arne &Aring;se replies: First, people of my generation 
                are not too fluid in English. We didn't grow up with English-language 
                films, soap operas, songs or the internet. Because of that you 
                will have to excuse me for not being able to formulate my answers 
                as precisely as I could in my own Norwegian language. The problem 
                in giving this kind of interview is that it always has an element 
                of building up one's own image. I will try not to do that. I know 
                it is important, but I think artists are too keen on building 
                images. Staying in the art scene for so many years, talking to 
                so many people, about art philosophy, about concepts, that has 
                many aspects. I think I know the 'right' answers to most of the 
                questions that are asked and discussed by artists, journalists 
                and art historians. I will not do it in that way but try to answer 
                in a simple and understandable way. And I don't like big fat words. 
                The paradox is that an image can also be not to have any image. 
                I just want to be a person that has general professional respect 
                in the world for inventing original artistic expressions. Like 
                a scientist in his field. A scientist doesn't need an image, he 
                needs results. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="images/ase1.jpg" alt="Porcelain vase by Arne Ase" width="250" height="230" align="left">To 
                answer your first question, I never meant to become a ceramic 
                artist. It happened by coincidence. The plan was to study architecture, 
                but I was not accepted. When I applied to the art school there 
                was the possibility to make a second choice. I put my mark on 
                the ceramic department and was accepted (I had never seen clay 
                before). I remember I thought that this would be fun because I 
                had always liked to make things, draw and paint. But my parents 
                did not like it: 'How are you going to feed your wife and children?' 
                They would have liked me to become a doctor or a lawyer or something 
                like that. That was what well- educated young men did in Norway 
                in the early 1960s.</p>
              <p align="left">The first years (in the mid and late 1960s) I was 
                working in an abstract expressionistic style, mainly expressing 
                the material in a traditional modernistic way: rough clay, finger 
                marks and so on. I was looked upon as a modern (trendy) ceramic 
                artist, and made sculptural works. Looking back I am sure that 
                I did what I thought a modern ceramic artist should do, being 
                'correct' as an artist. And I had success in Norway. I used to 
                say that I was one of the first that jumped down from the potters 
                wheel and one of the few that climbed up again. I became tired 
                of the brown rough clay and wanted to work with clay that did 
                not have such a strong identity. The identity should belong to 
                me, not to the material. So porcelain became my material. It is 
                just like a sheet of white paper. And clay is what I am an expert 
                at. The art historians often say that I am representing a kind 
                of minimalism. That may be true, I prefer to express it in a different 
                way: I am trying to create complex visual expressions and experiences 
                out of nothing, painting with light. I have thought about it for 
                a while; it may be that the next development, concept or project 
                will be 'making as little as possible out of something', become 
                fuzzy, just disappear into smoke and fog but still be visible 
                &shy; and then just disappear &shy; but in my way. Another paradox: 
                When the noise is too strong and heavy, the way of being seen 
                is to become a whisper. That may be to stay in harmony with life.</p>
              <p align="left">The question about what I am expressing through 
                my work I find difficult to answer. It is said about poetry that 
                there are only three main topics: life, love and death. I regard 
                my work as visual poetry or, more precisely, visual music. It 
                should be the same for the eyes as music is for the ear. This 
                is not an original thing to say, but why should it be? I am trying 
                to create and communicate an emotion in the same way as a composer 
                is trying to create and communicate with his music. And it is 
                done in an abstract way in both cases. The audience should have 
                the possibility to interpret, mainly within frames defined by 
                me. I feel like a jazz musician playing around and improvising 
                on self-composed themes. It does not really mean anything, except 
                for the feelings it creates. And as a famous jazz musician, I 
                think it was Charlie Parker, said: 'You never get more out of 
                the horn than you are putting into it.'</p>
              <p align="left"><img src="images/ase2.jpg" alt="Porcelain vase by Arne Ase" width="223" height="181" align="left">I 
                do not have a love relationship with clay, but I know the material 
                well. I know my speciality, my niche, better than anyone in the 
                world. This fact gives my creativity a wide frame. I am examining 
                my tools precisely, seeking for possibilities that serve the message, 
                the expression, in the most optimal way. This message is also 
                formed by the tool. It is a spiral. I could have used many other 
                materials or techniques, whatever: glass, paper, flute, Photoshop 
                and so on. But then I would have had to dive into new possibilities 
                and study in detail new qualities, properties and characteristics. 
                That would take many years. I do not have the time for it. Many 
                artists say that the idea comes first, then the medium. You have 
                to understand a computer program in order to use it. You have 
                to know it well to use it in an advanced way. That doesn't mean 
                that you have to know the craft of pottery to be able to use it 
                in an advanced way. You do not have to be an old-fashioned master 
                of your craft. But you do have to know your program. Whether it 
                is a computer program or specialist knowledge like mine doesn't 
                matter. As a curiosity I may mention that the technical aspect 
                in my work is so little that everybody can learn it in short time. 
                But for familiarity, competence is needed. The challenge is what 
                to play and how. I have also eliminated the need of expensive 
                equipment as a criterion for my art. It is better to be a good 
                poet with paper and pen, than a poet with an advanced computer 
                and nothing to tell.</p>
              <p align="left">How do I consider my work? As I have said, I feel 
                like a composer who is performing his own music. The music is 
                made in a way that makes it possible to identify it without putting 
                on a signature. It is a signature in itself, like handwriting. 
                And everybody knows how many years it takes to develop handwriting. 
                Good forgers are able to copy it after some training. They are 
                craftsmen, dependent on other people's ideas. Quite apart from 
                the fact that most of the arts, or all of them, normally are, 
                let us say, 90 per cent craft and 10 per cent art and creativity. 
                And craft, including performing art, may be looked upon as 95&shy;100 
                per cent craft. Unsuccessful experiments cannot be regarded as 
                art but they are necessary to create the values. I think it is 
                like scientific research. I am undertaking research to create 
                some small and (hopefully) valuable changes to human culture. 
                That is why it is placed in museums. It is a part of the verification 
                process that research in art needs. It is publishing through serious 
                academic channels. I also write books, articles, give lectures 
                and demonstrations on how I work. The most common question I get 
                is this (a little simplified): 'Aren't you afraid of teaching 
                other professionals all your secrets?' I have a standard answer 
                to this question: 'Do you think the Norwegian violinist, Arve 
                Tellefsen, is afraid of showing people how he is playing the fiddle 
                &shy; or talk about it?'</p>
              <p align="left"><img src="images/ase3.jpg" alt="Porcelain platter by Arne Ase" width="218" height="214" align="left">Tellefsen 
                is a performing artist, but I am also composing music, and I am 
                the only person that can perform it. And it is impossible to industrialize 
                it. My privilege is to be an individual person. I consider my 
                work as fine art. If the criterion for being craft is that the 
                result is useful and has a practical purpose like containing something 
                , the definition of useful is narrow because it excludes most 
                of the communication values. Apart from that the definition is 
                wrong. We may try to define my bowls from that point of view. 
                They are not practical bowls, they are too thin. The bases they 
                are standing on are too small. It is not a bowl. It is the picture 
                of a bowl or the symbol for a bowl. The bowls are painted; and 
                the paintings have no practical purpose. The paintings are directly 
                impractical, difficult to keep clean. The paintings on the inside 
                and outside are the reality. They are not pictures. This reality 
                is composed in layers with lines, areas, plain squares, squares 
                that create optical illusions and more. Some elements are fuzzy, 
                others are clear and defined (like music). There are themes and 
                rhythms. If I take a photo of this reality, or draw it, it becomes 
                a picture of the reality. Often art is the picture of reality, 
                like a painting of a landscape. I am familiar with Japanese ceramics 
                and the two traditions mentioned quite well. It is good for culture 
                and for the traditionalists that they are highly respected and 
                evaluated. You could say that traditional ceramic is more like 
                performing art and that the 'avant-garde' wants to be a more creative 
                art. That doesn't mean that one is more valuable than the other. 
                I am not trying to be polite, I mean it. I have chosen to place 
                myself right in the middle of a tradition and am trying to find 
                new ways from that position. From my point of view that is one 
                of the most demanding challenges it is possible to choose.</p>
              <p align="left">From my own experience in earlier days I find it 
                easier to create expressions that look new (and artistic) when 
                I don't have to compete with sculptors &shy; which I should have 
                done. I have talked to sculptors about this; most of them regard 
                clay as an unpractical material for sculpture. There are some 
                exceptions, but that is well known from history. Chinese horses 
                for example, but these horses should not exist in the real world, 
                they should stay underground. There is a good possibility to create 
                large work from small elements. I think that it is more or less 
                a mistake to stress the sculptural possibilities in clay (except 
                indoor table sculptures). I am looking at modern ceramics from 
                Japan. I find much of it interesting and highly qualified work. 
                But from my point of view &shy; the less sculpture it tries to 
                be, the better it is.</p>
              <p align="left">The Japanese/American artist, Jun Kaneko, as well 
                as some Japanese living in Japan, are creating examples that show 
                us that you need to be smart to find a solution that is acceptable 
                from a sculptural point of view. Especially if the goal is to 
                make large-scale work. It is limited if you don't use the painting 
                possibilities. Some have done that. If it is a question of becoming 
                more like the pictorial artists, I think the best way is to develop 
                two-dimensional work in clay. But you know, most of the tile works 
                in Italy and Holland were painted by professional painters, not 
                by ceramists or potters. They did not have an adequate education 
                and tradition. The question of becoming more like the pictorial 
                artists is interesting. Who is becoming more like whom? If you 
                take a look at Western European painting and sculpture from the 
                past 500 years, it becomes clear that it has become more and more 
                abstract, ornamental and symbolic as time has passed. Visual communication 
                in general has been taken over by other media. These values or 
                means are the most central in the traditional craft-cultures all 
                over the world, independent of time, and it has been that way 
                forever.</p>
