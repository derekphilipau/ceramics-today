                  totally for the gas line. I called my gas company (propane)

                  it for me. I bought the actual burners themselves by mail from 
                  a source in Los Angeles. Then, the propane guy came out, scoped 
                  out the job and came back and connected the venturis to the 
                  system. </td>

                <td width="35%"> At this point I also ordered sheets of galvanized 
                  steel for the outer surface of the kiln. It serves both functionally-holding 
                  the thermal insulation and bricks in and visually, being much 
                  more attractive to look at than the outer layer of the kilnwall, 
                  which is rigid thermal insulation. When that was ready, I hired 
                  a welder from the want ads, to come and fix a few minor adjustments 
                  and put the galvanized steel into the frame. Unfortunately, 
                  the film was defective from this point 'til after the kiln walls 
                  and chimney are bricked.<br> </td>

                  The first thing I did, to start filling in this blank frame 
                  I had constructed, was to line the sides and bottom layers with 
                  thermal insulation. This kiln design has six burners coming 
                  up from the bottom along both sides. I had to cut the port holes 
                  for the burners in the insulation. It was then I realized that 
                  I had miscalculated and made the burner assembly 5.5" too wide, 
                  necessitating a crosspipe being shortened. Lining the kiln was 
                  easy, as the insulation material is much like layered cardboard 
                  and very easy to cut to fit. The only drawback about working 
                  with the insulation is the itchy dust. When the insulation layer 
                  was all in, we started on the walls. The side walls went fairly 
                  quickly and smoothly but the back wall, with the flue, chimney 
                  and damper to think about went a bit more roughly. I was unhappy 
                  with the back wall after the first try. After discussing my 
                  design with an online friend, in particular the meeting of the 
                  cart and the kiln at the back wall, I decided to take the back 
                  wall down and rebuild it, changing the cart/kiln seal and fixing 
                  the crookedness that bothered me. The second incarnation of 
                  the back wall was much better. My flue design is Nils Lou's 
                  venturi design from <i>The Art of Firing</i>, with a horizontal 
                  damper up above the flue.<br> </td>

                  I wrangled Gary to help me build an arch form out of plywood, 
                  cutting arcs of wood and running strips lengthwise. I used Fred 
                  Olsen's book to determine how many bricks I should need. I decided 
                  to cut the sideskews for the arch, as I had forgotten to order 
                  them with my other brick. </td>

                  as a guide to set the mitering square used to mark each skew
