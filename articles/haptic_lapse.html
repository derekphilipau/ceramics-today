              <BR>
              I recollect a recent conversation with someone who was in charge 
              of putting together an elective program in ceramics. This once great 
              department (which shall remain nameless) was still full of sufficient 
              equipment and<BR>
              materials to run a mid sized factory, but it could no longer attract 
              enough students or faculty support to offer a full time course of 
              study. Where once students had competed to gain entrance to a full 
              fee paying four-year diploma,<BR>
              the three-year subsidized degree had been cancelled due to lack 
              of interest. Art school life had become a series of electives, the 
              educational equivalent of channel surfing. The bothersome discipline 
              of clay and wheel had long ago lost ground to the fidgets of undergraduate 
              conceit, and no amount of spin could disguise the fact that the 
              situation was terminal. With multi-skilling and the departure of 
              the last of the tenured staff it was only a matter of time.<BR>
              <BR>
              In response to my highly undiplomatic suggestion that many ceramics 
              departments had brought this situation upon themselves, I was rather 
              archly informed that they still offered a unit called 'The Vessel', 
              by which I was to assume that they had the situation well in hand.<BR>
              <BR>
              My thoughts turned to a formidable artist and educator I had the 
              privilege of knowing, who was once heard to mutter that it would 
              be better if, and I quote, '.all the ceramists would just take their 
              vessels and sail away', or words to that effect.<BR>
              <BR>
              There is probably nothing intrinsically wrong with an environment 
              where students wander in, fiddle with a lump of clay, paint it blue, 
              stick a feather in the side and call it art. It happens in sculpture 
              departments all the time. It does no permanent harm, or good, which 
              is not to say that it is a wholly benign activity. The damage occurs 
              when such things are confused with several thousand years of a enerable, 
              and utterly different tradition, that of pottery.<BR>
              <BR>
              How, you may ask, is this possible? Surely a lumpy feathered blue 
              thing cannot be mistaken for a pot?<BR>
              <BR>
              The problem is one of nomenclature.<BR>
              <BR>
              Pottery is not sculpture, and it is only nominally ceramics.<BR>
              <BR>
              Pottery refers to types of objects and materials, the place where 
              these materials are manipulated and the objects are made, and the 
              general disciplines associated with making them. People who work 
              in this field are called potters.<BR>
              <BR>
              Sculpture is a different activity entirely, well understood, albeit 
              periodically contested, within a western paradigm of art history. 
              It is also a widely used term describing certain types of non-functional 
              objects. What a sculpture is made of is entirely irrelevant, insofar 
              as it does not effect the categorization of the object as sculpture. 
              Sculptures are made from marble and ice, telephones and twigs, and 
              the musings of seagulls in the rain, as long as they have a presence 
              in German biennales. People who make sculptures are called sculptors, 
              when they are not being called installation artists, thus explaining 
              why their work only 'occupied the space' for a week.<BR>
              <BR>
              Ceramics are a group of materials with defined chemical and physical 
              properties. Ceramics are also objects made from these materials. 
              A brick and a Ming vase, and our lumpy feathered blue thing, are 
              examples of these objects. Ceramists, or ceramicists, base their 
              work on these material choices, and if they have been to art school 
              they 'define their practice' as making objects primarily or exclusively 
              out of ceramic materials, otherwise known as clay. Ceramics is also 
              a hobby, where overglaze decoration is applied to a bewildering 
              variety of slip-molded forms, designed to be fired at low temperatures. 
              Sometimes these same techniques are utilized by 'ceramists', potters 
              and sculptors, where the desire for irony or bright colors can be 
              given full reign. A ceramist may make either pots or sculptures, 
              but they generally like to call these objects 'ceramics'. I'm not 
              sure why.<BR>
              <BR>
              Lately, we have seen the arrival of a new group of practitioners, 
              the 'designer-makers'.<BR>
              <BR>
              'Hi, my name is Troy, and I'm a designer-maker with a ceramics based 
              practice. I am currently developing a body of work, which explores 
              the gender politics of domestic objects, and locates the kitchen 
              as a site of abjection.'<BR>
              <BR>
              Troy is a completely understandable product of the average ceramics 
              department, the logical outcome of a system which privileges Habermas 
              over Hamada. For the ceramics and painting student alike, the teaching 
              of art<BR>
              history, when it struggles back to a time before Andy, may dwell 
              on 16<SUP>th</SUP> century Italy, but it won't be Majolica that 
              is celebrated. This is because there is a hierarchy of art, an ever 
              repeated narrative reified behind the massive<BR>
              stone columns, or more lately titanium scales, which fence off the 
              paddocks where curators chew the cud of futures past. The temple 
              trains its acolytes, and, unlikely as it seems, some of them begin 
              life at places like art school.<BR>
              Fine art is money and power, the designer gym where Western culture 
              flexes and preens, and the decorative arts are something you pass 
              on the way to a wonderful new eatery. In this world pottery is way 
              out of its league.
