              Similarly, the increased spontaneity arising from the ability to 
              stick together then pull apart and rejoin dry parts of paperclay 
              art, opens up the possibility of artists making pieces, sending 
              them unfired to other artists who might add to, subtract from, and 
              modify the work before firing. This offers the possibility of physical 
              transcultural exchanges in ceramic art &#8211; an 'Internet of Objects' 
              rather than text or images. Delicate unfired pieces may be traded 
              or shipped around the world, assembled and fired for exhibitions. 
              The resulting reduction in insurance and freight costs may open 
              up international exchanges in lighter and more delicate work. 
            <p> As whole unfired works can be broken apart and reassembled again 
              and again until a satisfactory result is achieved, for me the result 
              of working in this way has fostered an even greater degree of irreverence 
              to material traditions. The impact of this cumulative process is 
              best illustrated when I find myself continuing to break off and 
              add pieces to the work even after firing. Sometimes this involves 
              adding unfired paperclay and refiring, or works are designed to 
              have pieces broken off after firing. This may challenge the general 
              perception that a broken work is damaged and devalued, but some 
              potters find this irreverent attitude personally liberating in their 
              own work. 
            <p> By building with dry pieces and rods, the conventional vessel 
              wall and illusion of mass may disappear. Viewer attention can be 
              drawn away from the profile towards gaps in the wall and glimpses 
              of its interior surface and space. This can be taken further in 
              that the lines formed by the rods suspend or support themselves 
              in space. It is as if the work is a three dimensional drawing in 
              space, rather than the conventional painted lines of glaze on the 
              surface of the vessel wall. That is, the 'lines' of clay have real 
              mass rather than being merely an illusion of mass. Prior to paperclay, 
              this effect required considerable skill in joining and drying this 
              type of work; now the same effect can become quick and easy, as 
              well as increasingly spontaneous. 
            <p> Thus paperclay increases the number of ways of building in clay, 
              increasing the visual vocabulary of ceramic artists and challenging 
              them to become more irreverent about their own and others' work. 
              It challenges established traditional ceramic skill hierarchies 
              but, provided it is taught in an open manner, it may increase the 
              appeal of ceramics as an artistic medium. Perhaps its greatest potential 
              lies in its pre-fired strength and dry-to-dry joining. These properties 
              suggest a number of new and real ways for ceramic artists to interact, 
              regardless of distance.
