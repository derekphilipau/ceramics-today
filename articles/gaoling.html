<P>Half a day's trip to the north of Jingdezhen is the "High Ridge", which is 
  the exact meaning of the word Gaoling or Kaolin. From this place came the white 
  hard-fired clay, which was the secret ingredient of Chinese porcelain. It made 
  up the "bones" of the porcelain clay body. The Kaolin clay was mined in open 
  quarries and dug out of tunnels. Sometimes practically clean, sometimes mixed 
  with whitish gravel. The gravel was washed out of the clay here, before it was 
  delivered to Jingdezhen in the form of white clay bricks. 
<P>By the end of the Ming dynasty the clay mining here came to an end. But in 
  huge mounds, ridges or hills the white gravel is still here. Actually the clay 
  is still here to, but the gravel that was separated from the clay became to 
  much for the local peasants, when it flushed down on their fields and ruined 
  the soil. The district mandarin is then known to have reported that the clay 
  had come to an end and that the production must stop. Whether this also was 
  an act of opposing the conquering Manchurian Qing dynasty is as far as I know 
  still to be researched, but the timing make it seems like it could have been 
  part of the considerations. </STRONG>

<P>During 1991 and 1992 I had the privilege to visit the city of Jingdezhen and 
  its surroundings as an interested student of Chinese porcelain functioning as 
  expedition photographer in a small group of scholars and students of Oriental 
  art, the most notably being Bo Gyllensv&auml;rd, former head and founder of 
  The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm. All pictures illustrating 
  this article is taken then.
