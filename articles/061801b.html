            <p><a href="061801j.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/fred-benny_sm.jpg" width="131" height="120" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>In
              1989 VisGirda had the opportunity to be an exchange artist with 
              the <i>Soviet Arts Union</i> and visited Moscow, St. Petersburg 
              and Vilnius, in his home country of Lithuania (then still part of 
              the Soviet Union). There VisGirda met relatives of his family and 
              became interested in his own background as a Lithuanian national. 
              Since then, VisGirda has developed the links to that country by 
              revisiting and attending various symposia. He also regularly exhibits 
              at the Lithuanian Museum (just outside of Chicago). </p>
            <p><a href="061801k.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/lucky_dog_sm.jpg" width="120" height="120" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>When
              VisGirda's mother moved across the street from where he now lives 
              in Champaign, Illinois, the artist spotted another opportunity to 
              meld dog and ceramic. His mother's dog is a Cocker Spaniel named 
              Benny. Benny is a very friendly and excitable dog and is spoiled 
              rotten by VisGirda's mother, who also takes care of 3 feral sibling 
              cats named 'Form', 'Function', and 'Fiction'...</p>
            <p>Now, VisGirda and his wife Billie have a Dalmatian named Dorothy. 
              They have had her for 14 years. Dorothy is much easier to incorporate 
              in ceramic work - VisGirda says it's fun and easy to make black 
              dots on a white background. The hard part is making the dots look 
              right - not real but 'right'. &quot;It's like the difference between 
              Japanese and Chinese horse sculptures: Chinese horses are wonderful 
              in their anatomical correctness, whereas Japanese are all out of 
              proportion and there is no particular attention to a semblance of 
              reality - however when one looks at a Japanese horse, one gets a 
              wonderful feeling of 'horseness'. I would like my dog pieces to 
              have a similar feeling of 'dogness' - without having to rely on 
              physical proportion and anatomy&quot;, says VisGirda.</p>
            <p><a href="061801l.html"><img src="../images/visgirda/family_sm.jpg" width="132" height="120" align="left" border="0"></a>VisGirda
              and his wife haven't got any children (yet) so he's tending to use 
              their pets as a source of imagery. They have Dorothy, the Dalmatian 
              and Fred, the Lovebird. Lately VisGirda has been thinking more about 
              relationships and commitments and things that matter to him especially 
              in terms of what he considers as 'family'. Conditions of repression 
              and later developments in the old Eastern Bloc have also been on 
              his mind. While VisGirda hasn't changed much stylistically in the 
              past ten years, his subject matter has become more personal and 
              emotional. Instead of being a detached observer, he is now incorporating 
              elements from his past and reworking them with the present. </p>

              in the USA.</p>
