              article by Reid Harvey
            <p>My ceramic safari continued through Ethiopia to Uganda and from 
              there I went to Kenya to work with their Ministry of Commerce, Department 
              of Industry. The legions of tourists that come to Kenya are here 
              to see the wildlife, however, not ceramics. But there is adventure 
              in technology transfer that leads into uncharted areas where appropriate 
              technology in the high temperature processes must be tried, adequately 
              researched and documented. Further areas that need appropriate research 
              include: development of appropriate mould materials as alternatives 
              to plaster-of-paris for casting and pressing; identification and 
              winning of minerals on a micro-scale; development of an appropriate 
              glazed food storage container; and an effective low-cost water filter. 
              While having done work in each of these areas, I am also developing 
              appropriate electric test kilns and their refractories and appropriate 
              crucibles for high temperature processes. All these must be made 
              using available resources because Western-style supplies are rarely 
              available. There is some literature available on this subject and 
              what first comes to mind is Cardew's classic, Pioneer Pottery, based 
              on his own ceramic journey in Nigeria. But a more recent and comprehensive 
              approach to ceramic education and training can be found in a four-volume 
              set of books "The Self Reliant Potters Series," by Henrik Norsker 
              and James Danisch and published by GATE, the German Appropriate 
              Technology Exchange. This series offers the only information of 
              its kind on simplified, appropriate technology of ceramics. Its 
              volumes include: Clay Materials, Refractories and Kilns, Glazes, 
              and Forming Processes. But with respect, Norsker and Danisch's invaluable 
              contribution is only the tip of the iceberg. Each section of each 
              of the four books suggests volumes of additional research. </p>
            <p> <img align=Left src="../images/safari8.jpg" hspace="5" width="152" height="150"><i>Left: 
              Low-fire ceramic drums, Dajo, Sudan.</i> 
            <p>Another set of books is the series "Build Your Own Metal Working 
              Shop from Scrap," by David Gingery, published in the United States 
              by Lindsay Publications. The seven volumes in this series start 
              with a book called "Build a Charcoal Foundry." The second book in 
              the series is called "Build a Metal Lathe." Again, using scrap metal, 
              the cast parts needed for the lathe can be made with the help of 
              the charcoal foundry already built. Gingery's subsequent books tell 
              how to make a drill press, a shaper, a milling machine and all the 
              other accessories needed in a complete metal fabrication shop. All 
              these machines can be made using parts turned on the lathe. The 
              cost of the entire metal fabrication shop is negligible. Through 
              Gingery's books and those of Norsker and Danisch, the means of industrialisation 
              through ceramics and metal are adequately proven. One other book 
              on appropriate technology makes the case for small projects. This 
              is the Schumacher classic "Small is Beautiful." This book stresses 
              developing skills and traditions in various crafts and underlines 
              the problems with large scale industries.
            <p> The history of failure of large projects is understood. A brick 
              plant requires electricity for blowers but can get none. A vocational 
              school in the desert has massive machines but neither teachers nor 
              students. But there still exists an impetus to create and fund these 
              white elephants. The allure of a quick fix is irresistible, and 
              the subsequent news of failure is easily squelched. There is a lack 
              of commitment by donors, contractors and beneficiaries, starting 
              with a feeling that no one really owns the project. 
            <p> So what can we do? If you want to help bring ceramics and micro-enterprise 
              to developing countries, start by telling people that teapots are 
              beautiful, but there is a whole lot more to ceramics. Inform donors 
              and politicians just how vital ceramics is in the development process. 
              Tell them that education and training are the only key inputs and 
              that in developing countries, all other resources are locally available. 
              Let them know that ceramic manufacturers' products make possible 
              a wide variety of other micro-scale industries and that your country's 
              development assistance should be applied to such projects. Get together 
              with other ceramists you know and find ways of assisting ceramists 
              in developing countries. 
            <p> The goal of this safari is to give individuals a decent and productive 
              livelihood through micro-enterprise and help them to stem environmental 
              degradation at the same time.
