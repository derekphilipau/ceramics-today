<IMG align=left SRC="../images/c_gills.gif" alt="C">ontinuing our survey of international ceramics instiitutions, this week we have a look at schools in Australia and Europe.
<P>
Perhaps the best designed university ceramics department web page in Australia is the <A HREF="http://www.rmit.edu.au/departments/fa/Fineart/ceramgal.html"><B>Canberra School of Art Ceramics Department</B></A> online gallery. The well made site features work by staff members Alan Watt, Greg Daly, Janet De Boos, Anita McIntyre and others.
The <A HREF="http://www.rmit.edu.au/departments/fa/Fineart/ceramgal.html"><B>RMIT University Ceramics</B></A> web site features work by Gary Bish, David Ray, Natash Patkovski and other staff and students.
<P>
Top marks for the <A HREF="http://www.uiah.fi/kll/gallery.html"><B>University of Art &amp; Design Helsinki, Ceramic &amp; Glass Design Department</B></A>, web site, which not only features an appealing web design, but also interesting and beautifully photographed ceramics and glass works. <A HREF="http://www.wmin.ac.uk/media/designmedia/ceramics/student/exhibitors.html"><B>Harrow</B></A>, the well-known British insitution also offers a well-made site with about 2 dozen students pages, with innovative work. The <A HREF="http://www.ikts.fhg.de/index.engl.html"><B>Fraunhofer Institute of Ceramic Technologies and Sintered Materials</B></A> is a school of a different nature, which concentrates on materials research, technological developments and manufacturing of components in the area of inorganic non-metallic high performance materials.
