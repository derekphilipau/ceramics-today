            <p><br>
              <b>The Objective of Organizing the Emomm Exhibition</b></p>
            <p>The past twenty years has seen a considerable change in the ceramic 
              tendency within the contemporary ceramic movement of Korea. Although 
              the Korean tradition and custom is deeply rooted in the Korean mentality, 
              most people today have been influenced by the abundance of imported 
              utility wares found in our current ceramic market. In general, most 
              Korean people possess at least one type of traditional ceramic ware 
              &#8211; be it a celadon, buncheong, onggi jar, white ware. Yet despite 
              such phenomenon, more and more people are turning their eyes towards 
              purchasing imported ceramics in the likes of Royal Doulton, Wedgwood, 
              Rosenthal or Royal Copenhagen. The last ten years has seen an increase 
              in preference towards such imported ceramics.</p>
            <p> The basis of the Korean culture is still dominated largely by 
              Confucian philosophy, which began in the Joseon Period (late 14th 
              century &#8211; early 20th century). Even today many of the rites 
              that we practice daily descend from Confucianism and neo-Confucian 
              mentality. Therefore our customs root back to the past and much 
              of it has been preserved in our current life style. The Korean people 
              rely more on the Lunar Calendar and many of our major national holidays 
              coincide with the 12 Solar Systems of this calendar.</p>
            <p> When we examine the life style of the Korean people today, it 
              is evident that many of the ceramic wares appear to be inappropriate 
              for our inherent habits. This applies to both imported ceramic wares 
              and those that are made nationally by our own companies. Until now 
              there has not been a production line that best accommodate our custom 
              and daily diet.</p>
            <p align="center"><a href="images/emomm/Choi1.jpg"><img src="images/emomm/thumbs/Choi1.jpg" width="180" height="120" hspace="2" border="0"></a><a href="images/emomm/Jung2.jpg"><img src="images/emomm/thumbs/Jung2.jpg" width="180" height="120" hspace="2" border="0"></a></p>
            <p> Consequently, the professors of the <a href="http://www.ewha.ac.kr/eng/academics/college/art_design_index.jsp"><b>Ewha 
              College of Art and Design</b></a>, renowned national designers and 
              ceramic artists have gathered together at the Ewha Womans University&#8217;s 
              Ceramics Research Institute to design a contemporary tableware that 
              is most apt for our customs with reference to the modern transitions 
              in life style. Furthermore, the initiative commemorates the 46th 
              anniversary of the Ewha Ceramics Research Institute, the pioneer 
              of contemporary ceramics movement in Korea and also the leader of 
              ceramics as an academic subject in universities.</p>
            <p> With the leading specialists in design and crafts, the Ewha Ceramics 
              Research Institute has planed an exhibition on ceramic tableware. 
              It is an attempt to redefine the contemporary Korean table setting 
              with the different ceramic wares designed by the Ewha Ceramics Research 
              Institute as a glimpse into the contemporary tendency and preference.</p>
            <p>The exhibition has been titled E-MOMM after Ewha Womans University's 
              E and MOMM meaning spirit and embracement. From ancient times, the 
              Koreans believed that the spirit has been vesseled by our physical 
              body. Therefore to accommodate both the importance of Ewha Womans 
              University and the spirit of craftsmanship, the exhibition has been 
              titled E-MOMM. This title is also used as the Brand Identity for 
              the ceramic wares on display in the exhibition. The brand name integrates 
              the current social tendency simultaneously as representing the Korean 
              mentality in crafts.</p>
            <p>Like a mother preparing a hearty meal for her family, the maternal 
              spirit and mentality has been vesseled in all of the objects on 
              display for the E-MOMM exhibition.</p>

                <td>The Ewha Ceramics Research Institute was the first to be established 
                  within an academic environment along with its ceramic art department. 
                  It was founded in 1958 and this year marks its 46th anniversary. 
                  It began as an organization researching on methods to modernize 
                  traditional wares of Korea. Its founder, Hwang, Jong Gu came 
                  from a long line of ceramic tradition and he is looked upon 
                  as the father of contemporary Korean ceramics. His achievements 
                  are highly praised as he attempted to start the contemporary 
                  ceramics movement during a period when any cultural preservation 
                  was bleak in Korea. He pushed to develop the existing traditional 
                  wares a step further for modern appeal.</td>

              is a collaborative initiation to redefine the existing tableware 
              of Korea. The subject for the exhibition is based on Korea&#8217;s 
              12 main Solar Seasons. Our national holidays are connected to these 
              Solar Seasons and they usually announce seasonal changes in the 
              weather. In general, many of the Korean custom, is closely tied 
              to these 12 main seasons and they are usually about paying respect 
              to ancestors, evil spirits, maintaining an opulent life, good health 
              and fortune. Furthermore, special dishes and foods are eaten on 
              national occasions, which are often celebrated with formal rites. 
              For instance a year begins by celebrating the Lunar New Year&#8217;s 
              Day and on this day we eat a soup dish with rice cakes in addition 
              to specially made desserts. Each dish is served on a particular 
              type of ceramic ware as they have different significance, color 
              and taste. These aspects of the Korean diet and food serving, has 
              been taken into consideration in the designs for the Emomm Exhibition.</p>
            <p> <a href="images/emomm/emomm3.jpg"><img src="images/emomm/thumbs/emomm3.jpg" width="147" height="150" border="0" align="left"></a>Spring 
              is welcomed by serving different herbal dishes as they act as medicines 
              to preserve the health so that the body is able to prepare itself 
              for the hot season to come. Even the herbs and vegetables have different 
              significances. Some are said to heal the body and some for boosting 
              certain organs.</p>
            <p> In Korea it is important to pay respect to the deceased ancestors 
              as they protect the family descendents from evil spirits while bringing 
              good fortune. Subsequently, respect is paid by laying a table filled 
              with delicious food, on specific ceramic wares for the spirit to 
              return and enjoy some of their favorite dishes.<br>
              The Korean way of life is closely related to such rites and practices. 
              Therefore it is necessary to design ceramic wares that can serve 
              the rites properly.</p>
            <p><b>The Significance of the Emomm Exhibition for the Development 
              of Korean Contemporary Ceramics</b></p>
            <p><img src="images/emomm/artists.jpg" width="167" height="436" align="left">Korea 
              possesses a remarkable ceramic history and culture that is more 
              than 5 000 years old. It is renowned for its own celadon, buncheong 
              and white wares. Yet despite the nation's rich historical inheritance, 
              most of its people are unaware of its cultural value. There is a 
              lack of national support given to the preservation and the development 
              of contemporary ceramics. The Japanese Colonization severed Korea's 
              ceramic tradition leaving the nation in loss of its own identity. 
              This was further aggravated by the intervention of foreign troops 
              and the Korean War. Therefore, it is not until the 1980's that Korea 
              began to raise the standard of its overall lifestyle and to begin 
              concentrating on the preservation of its culture. The 1980's saw 
              a sudden acceleration in Korea's economy but this continued to affect 
              the Korean culture as it underwent many radical transitions. Consequently, 
              the advancement from Korea's fundamental ceramic wares has been 
              considerably difficult. Until now there has not been a contemporary 
              substitute that is able to best represent Korea&#8217;s rich tradition 
              simultaneously as possessing a universal appeal that can contribute 
              to Korea's ceramic development.</p>
            <p>Today, the social tendency is to integrate cultures. It is an era 
              where styles are crossing over and where cultures are being shared 
              to understand one another. In art, there have already been attempts 
              to move away from existing principles and genres. Instead of following 
              any one concept, art is crossing boundaries taking on a more interdisciplinary 
              form. The same phenomenon is making a mark in culture and economy 
              in search of a brand that can accommodate the contemporary trend. 
            </p>
            <p> The Emomm exhibition is an initiative to create a variation of 
              ceramic tableware that relate to tradition simultaneously as making 
              an advancement by fulfilling the requirements of modern life. Furthermore 
              it hopes to contribute to the development of contemporary Korean 
              ceramics.</p>
            <p align="left">The EMOMM exhibition will be on view at the EWHA Art
