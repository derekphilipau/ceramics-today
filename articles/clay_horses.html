            <p>Massive terracotta horses have been built by Tamil villagers in 
              south India for thousands of years. Stephen Inglis states that &quot;technically 
              they are the most ambitious achievements in clay found in India 
              and by any survey probably the largest hollow clay images to be 
              created anywhere&quot; <sup>(1)</sup>. </p>

                  porous a solution of oxides used as colorants are easily absorbed 
                  and thus made durable. Fifty years have altered them only slightly. 
                  Although the annual rains soak the porous clay, no harm results 
                  because Tamilnadu never freezes. In other climates water penetrating

            <p>The methods used to construct and to fire images nine to fifteen 
              feet or more in height are unique in ceramic history and of unusual 
              interest to clay specialists. They differ dramatically from the 
              images of horses and soldiers recently excavated in China, in that 
              they are larger than life-size and fired in situ. Not only is the 
              size impressive, but the proportions and embellishment are superb. 
              These works are created by a caste of hereditary potter/priests 
              who are products and heirs of an ancient tradition in which clay 
              and religion are inseparably linked.</p>

            <p>Tamil people of the cities know little of them and for the ordinary 
              village people, work on such images involves skills and a sacred 
              ritual of which they have little knowledge. The work is almost never 
              seen in big towns or cities, sold in fairs, or otherwise displayed. 
              Although some attention has been given by scholars to the religious 
              complex in which they playa part, information about massive images 
              and the craftsmen who build them is not to be found in the literature 
              on south India&quot; <sup>(2)</sup>. </p>

            <p>In May, 1980, as an Indo-American Fellow, I was able to observe 
              at first hand, in remote and abandoned village shrines, ancient 
              examples of these massive terracotta horses &quot;with fiercely 
              noble heads standing ready to carry god or demon&quot; <sup>(3)</sup>. 
              As I looked at them, numerous questions came to mind: How old were 
              they? Who made them? What was their purpose? Were they still being 
              made? How could such huge clay images be fired? How could passages 
              of clay varying in thickness from two to sixteen inches be dried 
              and fired without mishap of any kind? </p>
            <p>The answers to these questions would shed new light on the methods 
              used in the past by the Etruscans, the Chinese, and pre-Columbian 
              peoples to create such larger-than-life terracotta images. The 
              craftsmen who made them clearly used methods of construction and 
              firing outside the spectrum of Western ceramic skills and processes. 
              Few, if any clay specialists in the Western world would attempt 
              to build and fire on-site ceramic sculpture of such monumental scale.</p>
            <p>Through the unfailing support of Ray Meeker and Deborah Smith of 
              the Golden Bridge Pottery in Pondicherry, I found some important 
              answers. Former students of Susan Peterson, they are the only American 
              potters successfully producing hand-thrown stoneware in India at 
              present.</p>
            <p>Their plan of organization made the documentation possible. Intrigued 
              with the projected filming of the construction of an Aiyanar horse, 
              they offered me the use of their recently purchased jeep to search 
              for Aiyanar shrines and potters. The three of us, together with 
              Ray's assistant, Ratchagar, to serve as translator, set out on a 
              four-wheel drive field trip.</p>
            <p>On a single day's outing, we sighted five Aiyanar shrines in the 
              outskirts of Chidambaram. Each of the sites held one or more terracotta 
              horses, each ten to twelve feet high constructed within the last 
              one hundred years. The surface decoration, in most cases, had weathered 
              away and the patina indicated considerable age. There was nothing 
              to indicate the date or the names of either the potters or donors. 
              Such facts were never recorded.</p>

            <p>Were such horses still being built? Thanks to my friends' fluency 
              in Tamil we soon found a pottery community reputed to have horse- 
              building skills in the village of Puthur, sixteen kilometers from 
              Chidambaram. When we found the earth and thatch dwellings of the 
              potters, we discovered an Aiyanar shrine nearby complete with a 
              huge standing terracotta horse, which the potters claimed was more 
              than one hundred years old. Near the older form was a more recent 
              horse built of cement, a material that has now almost completely 
              replaced clay as the medium for shaping ritual images. To the west 
              stood a large cement image of Aiyanar and to the south, a shrine 
              housed a much smaller image flanked by two consorts. The shrine 
              is in active use. Each evening some forty villagers worship there, 
              the women touching their foreheads to the ground and the men prostrating 
              themselves completely.</p>
            <p> The indigenous religious system, involving the belief in a male 
              deity, at once hero, protector, companion, and councilor, is Dravidian. 
              It predates by centuries the Aryan introduction of Hinduism with 
              its complex pantheon of deities in the second millennium B.C. During 
              the Middle Ages, in order to upgrade and legitimize Aiyanar through 
              association with mainline Hinduism, devotees evolved the story of 
              his birth as a son of Shiva and Vishnu (in the form of a beautiful 
              woman). Aiyanar helps on many important occasions in life -to choose 
              a bride or groom, to cure sickness, or to punish a wrongdoer. He 
              holds a metal sword in his hand on which devotees thrust paper messages 
              stating their various problems. Often the solutions are revealed 
              in dreams.</p>

            <p> We learned that the last large Aiyanar horse was commissioned 
              more than twenty years ago. But the potters assured us they still 
              knew how to build one. Would they do it? Would they accept a commission 
              from a non-Hindu - a foreigner? I was impressed with the potters 
              and had a genuine sympathy and liking for Aiyanar and his shrines. 
              Unlike Hindu temples, his shrines were always located in secluded 
              country areas in which trees were a necessary and auspicious component. 
              They were restrained-the sculptural quality of the clay or cement 
              images was stable and impressive. Perhaps the potters were moved 
              by my positive attitude and interest in Aiyanar; at any rate, they 
              decided to accept the commission. They agreed to build a horse nine 
              feet high in twenty days; it was to be situated next to the existing 
              horses. They quoted a price of 500 rupees. After haggling, they 
              reduced the figure to 400 rupees- ($48.00) - a good price by Indian 
              standards but by Western standards extremely low when one considers 
              that four or five men would work for twenty days to complete the 
              commission. </p>
            
              <p><b>Day One</b>: <br>

                They knew their business. On Monday, May 26, 1980, a puja (ritual) 
                was held to ensure the success of the project. To consecrate the 
                ground on which the horse was to be built, the potters encircled 
                the area using the blood streaming from the neck of a decapitated 
                rooster. Coconut halves were placed to each side of the area. 
                Liquor, an essential ritualistic ingredient, was present although 
                Tamil Nadu is a &quot;dry&quot; state. Technically, liquor is 
                illegal but this was &quot;home brew,&quot; which escaped official 
                scrutiny. Food offerings to Aiyanar completed the ritual. Secure 
                in the assurance that Aiyanar was now companion to the project, 
                the potters began construction.</p>
              
            <p>The preparation of the clay had taken place the day before. A circular 
              earth pit about four feet in diameter served as a mixing trough. 
              One part sedimentary earthenware is mixed with one part earthenware 
              topsoil. Although fine-grained, it contains silt. To this enough 
              water is added to produce a medium-viscosity slurry. The potters 
              knew this clay would fail as a medium for building large sculpture. 
              Large quantities of non-plastic ingredients are essential to prevent 
              shrinkage and hence cracking, as well as to permit thick passages 
              of clay. The non-plastic ingredients consist of three parts rice 
              hulls and approximately one part (by volume) of three-to-four-inch 
              lengths of rice straw. The potters added this to the earthenware 
              slurry and mixed it by foot to produce a medium soft mixture possessing 
              all the qualities of a &quot;castable.&quot; </p>

            <p>Large coils of this material were used to form rings around previously 
                inscribed twelve-inch circles on the ground marking the four &quot;hoofs&quot; 
                of the horse. A second coil of clay joined to the initial ring 
                extended the diameter to sixteen inches. Four of these clay rings 
                were formed to establish the four &quot;hoofs&quot; of the horse's 
                legs. This accomplished, a potter, using a metal excavating tool, 
                dug holes approximately twelve inches deep inside each ring of 
                clay. A potter set a wooden pole about six feet high inside one 
                hole and held it while a colleague quickly filled the entire hole 
                with clay thus supporting the pole in a vertical position. In 
                a similar fashion, vertical poles were set in the three remaining 
                holes. Each wooden pole, therefore, was supported by a solid mass 
                of clay mixture about sixteen inches across and twelve inches 
                deep. Without the use of rice hulls and straw such passages would 
                shrink and crack.</p>
              <p> These ingredients are the major part of the mixture by volume 
                and are essential to this type of monumental clay construction. 
                The last part to be constructed was a clay base for the central 
                rectangular support, 24&quot; x 24&quot;. This completed the first 
                day's work. Nothing further could be done until the moist clay 
                mixture stiffened.</p>

              
            <p> The potters spent their time in the afternoon preparing ropes 
              made of rice straw. Wrapped around the wooden uprights these ropes 
              create a compressible internal support system for the application 
              of about a four-inch wall of clay thereby eliminating any possibility

              On the morning of the second day of construction the potters completed 
              the task of winding the straw ropes around the four wooden uprights. 
              They then applied a four-inch wall of clay so that four large tubes 
              about 40 inches tall were formed, each serving as a metaphorical 
              leg. Next, four vertical uprights were fixed at the inside comer 
              of the base of the central rectangular support previously completed. 
              Straw ropes were wound around them to create an armature for a thick 
              application of clay. The potters worked surely and quickly in spite 
              of a 112 degree Fahrenheit temperature. Descendants of generations 
              of clay craftsmen, they have learned the skills from childhood and 
              are concerned only with the work at hand, In the afternoon they 
              completed the front and rear legs and the central rectangular support. 
              The front legs now stood as a single unit 44 inches high, 38 inches 
              wide, and 17 inches across, measured at the top center. By fixing 
              wooden supports to the wooden uprights, the potters created a horizontal 
              passage of clay that bridged the two front and rear legs. The clay 
              mixture was laid over and under these supports to create a level 
              horizontal surface. This completed, nothing more could be done until

              been part of the Western paradigm - yet the Etruscans, pre-Columbians, 
              Africans, and the potter-priests of India as well all constructed 
              temporary clay walls for on-site firing of monumental ceramic forms.</p>

              Ron du Bois, an emeritus professor of art, taught ceramics and studio 
              art at Oklahoma State University, USA. He was Fulbright professor 
              to Korea in 1973-74, where he taught ceramics at three Korean universities. 
              His award winning documentary, The Working Processes of the Korean 
              Folk Potter, was filmed at that time. In 1979-80, du Bois traveled 
              extensively in India as a 1979-80 Indo-American fellow to research 
              and document the work of Indian potters. Among other projects he 
              filmed the entire construction of perhaps the last massive terracotta horse to be built in India. The documentary, &quot;The Working 
              Processes of the Potters of India: Massive terracotta Horse Construction&quot; 
              was completed under the auspices of the National Endowment for the 
              Humanities and deals with the subject matter of this article. In 
              1987, du Bois was awarded a 10 month Fulbright Senior Research Scholar 
              grant, African Regional Research program, to research and document 
              Nigerian potters. For information on his POTTERS OF THE WORLD FILM/VIDEO
