<B>The Fl&acirc;neur and the Cyberfl&acirc;neur</B>
<P>
<IMG align=left SRC="../images/t_gills.gif" alt="T">he transitory figure of the Fl&acirc;neur was a partly real and
partly literary persona documented by Charles Baudelaire and Walter Benjamin.
He, (and he was largely seen as a male figure at the time<SUP>3</SUP> ),
was a social type who flourished in the second half of the 19th C and frequented
the arcades of Paris. His activity was that of flanerie -to stroll the
streets and observe the bustling life of the modern city. Since his beginnings,
the figure of the Fl&acirc;neur moved on to Vienna (Robert Musil, The Man
Without Qualities), Berlin (Walter Benjamin, Berlin Chronicle) and has
been witnessed in Satre's Nausea. The Fl&acirc;neur would mingle with the
crowd, endeavouring to remain anonymous, seeing and being seen, but not
recognised. He "jealously guards his individuality and agency by obscuring
it beneath the mask of the anonymous and insignificant 'man of the crowd',
pursues a course which alienates him from even the possibility of a deeper
inter-subjective exchange with the other members of the crowd scene. ...
fl&acirc;nerie is a sociability of Ones.(...) This is the life of watching
the world go by, not ever exchanging a word acknowledging the presence
of an Other. " <SUP>4</SUP> Poignant is here the Internet figure of the
'lurker', defined as someone who reads newsgroup or Listserve messages
without responding to them, thus remaining unnoticed.

<P>&nbsp;If Bruce Mazlish asks "what serves as the analogue to the city
for the post-modern spectator?" <SUP>5</SUP>, I would posit that today's
Fl&acirc;neurs can be found in Web space. The Cyberfl&acirc;neur 'strolls'
through information space, taking in the virtual architecture and remaining
anonymous. To take an analogy from aerial photography by Chombart de Lauwe,
s/he is "a voyeur of sorts, who not only enjoys the erotics of seeing all
from his hidden vantage point, but also enjoys the erotics of knowing all."
If the Fl&acirc;neur was a "decipherer of urban and visual texts" <SUP>6</SUP>, then the Cyberfl&acirc;neur is a decipherer of Virtual Reality and Hypertexts.
S/he is the voyeur of the post-information age. To "the list of contemporary
manifestations of fl&acirc;nerie adduced by Buck-Morss, for example the
'aural flanerie' of the grazing and zapping radio listener, the window-on-world
fl&acirc;nerie of television news, and the insular package-tour fl&acirc;nerie
associated with the mass tourist industry" <SUP>7</SUP> I would like to
add the fl&acirc;nerie of grazing information space.

<P>&nbsp;What the city and the street were to the Fl&acirc;neur, the Internet
and the Superhighway have become to the Cyberfl&acirc;neur. Both here and
there, there is "a beginning that does not threaten to solidify into a
consequence, a beginning which can only be followed by other beginnings,
and thus may be lived with the benign feeling of impunity." Here "the fl&acirc;neur
finds reprieve from time." <SUP>8</SUP>

<P><B>Of Malls and Cybermalls</B>

<P>&nbsp;In post-modernity, the refuge of the Fl&acirc;neur had become
the shopping mall, "a flaneur's paradise if ever there was one.(...) And
after all, to 'get out there and away from it all' was always the fl&acirc;neur's
dearest wish. And as a means to do that 'West Edmonton Hall (the worlds
largest shopping mall) is as gratifyingly mind-rotting an experience as
you could wish'." <SUP>9</SUP> "...this implausible, seemingly random collection
of images [West Edmonton Hall] has been assembled with an explicit purpose:
to support the mall's claim to contain the entire world within its walls.(...)
Sealed off from the tasks of everyday life, shopping became a recreational
activity and the mall an escapist cocoon." <SUP>10</SUP> But the world
of the mall, be it ever so huge, can't compete with the world of Cyberspace,
and as kids and adults spend ever more time in front of the computer terminal,
the figure of the post-modern shopping-mall-Fl&acirc;neur is being replaced
by the Cyberfl&acirc;neur of a new 'recreational site' and 'escapist cocoon'
-the Net. Today's Fl&acirc;neur is no longer to be found in the arcades
or the malls that mimic the arcades, but rather in front of an arcade game.
S/he no longer cruises the streets in search of modernity, but rather cruises
Cybermalls to do on-line shopping or in search of 'freebies' and Net sites
-s/he has become a Cybershopper, Net Voyeur and Information Tourist. Freed
from the dangers of physically moving around in the city, be they crime,
pollution, traffic hazards etc., today's anonymous immersion into the 'crowd'
happens in Cybermalls, Multi User Dungeons, File Transfer Protocol or Internet
Relay Chat. As Negroponte points out in his book, "The Internet surfers
are the crazy kids on the block. The digerarti have moved (...) into something
closer to a real life-style than an intellectual manifesto. Their nuptials
are in cyberspace. They call themselves bitniks and cybraians. Their social
mobility covers the planet. Today, they are the Salon des Refuses, but
their salon is not a cafe in Paris (...). Their salon is somewhere on the
Net. It is being digital."

<P>&nbsp;<B>Distorting Perceptions of Bodily Space on the Net</B>

<P>&nbsp;This move into Cyberspace brings with it a negation of the body,
ie when we enter the Infosphere, we leave our bodies behind. Instead, our
mind interacts with and traverses virtual space. But not only do we become
somewhat immaterial when we log onto the Internet, more and more activities
which are normally the realm of bodily space are being digitised.

<P>&nbsp;A good example of digitising bodily space is 'virtual tourism',
eg. in the form of 'The Digital City', a Dutch cybertown, with links to
real-life city Amsterdam. "The Digital City has 10,000 inhabitants. Its
streets and alleyways are links of hypertext strung through the World Wide
Web. On a good month 120,000 tourists pass through," says Peter Hinssen
in Wired (June '95). The way we experience a digital city is going to be
fundamentally different from actually being there, at least until Virtual
Reality overcomes its infancy stage. Looking at an on-line image of Amsterdam's
town hall, can't be compared to actually standing in front of the building,
but its better than not seeing it at all and a whole lot cheaper than physically
going there. Sound, video and VRML can add dimensions which make the experience
of Virtual Tourism more real. How real can such a virtual city be? Peter
Hinssen says that "The Digital City faces issues all too familiar to real-world
boom towns. What sort of services should it provide? How can it pay for
them? What is the proper relationship between public authority and private
enterprise?" Well, at least as a Cybertourist in the "Digital City" you
can't get mugged, or can you?

<P>&nbsp;The Digital City also offers a 'cyber bike path', another example
of how we are embracing virtual life to the detriment of physical being.
Access is via the bike sign in the (digital) city square. For a nation
of cyclists, it seems natural to have a representation of this transport
medium in the Digital City. The cyber bike path will take you on cyber
bike tours around the world, give information on bike races and link to
other sites of interest to the bike fan. Does this mean that we are about
to give up the physical activity in favour of the virtual activity? Probably
not, but we are associating more and more body related activities with
the on-line world.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Of Virtual Museums, Digital Art and On-line Galleries</B>

<P>&nbsp;An increasing number of Virtual Museums and Virtual Galleries
are to be found on the World Wide Web. Images of art, that are otherwise
inaccessible or only available in print form can now be viewed from the
comfort of one's own swivel chair. The implication may be that fewer people
will make the effort to physically visit the museum building when a possibly
much more exciting multi-media museum 'site' can be visited on the Internet
-and that museum could be located anywhere in the world. Speaking on multi-media
at the 1995 National Crafts Conference, Kylie Winkworth said that "multi-media
does challenge the primacy of the object in the museum -both in terms of
space on the display floor, and by replicating museums in multi-media form.
(...) real objects and multi-media involve two inimical ways of looking
that do not sit comfortably in the same context."

<P>&nbsp;The Virtual Museum of the Internet and its multi-media relative
the CD-ROM loom over the user with potential information overload, leading
to information grazing of the museum infosphere. Says Winkworth: "Multi-media
invites users to scroll quickly through hundreds of images with the relentless
clicking of a mouse (...) and does not encourage critical examination or
analysis." Will museums "teach us the skills of critically seeing the material
world" while we become ever more "visually satiated with graphic overload"?
Or will today's graphic overload become tomorrows accepted norm to the
detriment of experiencing the physical world? I think a survey amongst
arcade game prone teenagers of the First World would throw light on the
subject.

<P>&nbsp;The on-line gallery offers the artist a certain freedom of expression
and freedom from the constraints of physical materials. But those very
freedoms from physicality are also its shortcomings: its difficult to see
the rich texture of an on-line painting, or feel the rough surface of a
woodfired bowl. Nonetheless, Nicholas Negroponte is of the opinion that
"we are entering an era when expression can be more participatory and alive.
We have the opportunity to distribute and experience rich sensory signals
in ways that are different from looking at the pages of a book and more
accessible than travelling to the Louvre. Artists will come to see the
Internet as the world's largest gallery for their expressions and as a
means of disseminating them directly to people."

<P>&nbsp;Is the digitising of the Visual Arts and Crafts also taking place
on the Net? The emerging field of Virtual Craft and CyberCeramics is a
new expression of computer craft, which can only be experienced on a computer
terminal or at its molecular best be printed out as a laser print. Still,
Virtual Craft is a valid form of expression which can invigorate thought
processes that may feed back into physical art and craft practice. But
while there is a trend to increasing numbers of artists getting involved
in digital art, I'm still not sure that crafts practitioners are fleeing
the material world in increasing droves and that we will be witnessing
a "crafts diaspora", as Kevin Murray has stated.

<P>&nbsp;When more and more people are looking towards digital self-expression
and digital consumerism, does this mean that we are developing from a nation
of 'couch potatoes' to a nation of 'Netheads', that we are trading one
screen (the TV) for another (the computer terminal)? There is a danger
on the Net of mass information consumerism. The less discerning information
consumer could become tomorrows cybergoat, downing every digi-morsel that
comes across his or her path. The fact that there is a popular list of
'Useless World Wide Web Sites' on the Internet seems to support this idea.
In the meantime software developers are constantly refining applications,
eg. Voice Mail, CUSEEME Video Conferencing, VRML Virtual Reality...While
the developers are keeping up the momentum, the average user is usually
lagging one or two steps behind. But the above examples do point to an
ever increasing dematerialisation of bodily space and growing playground
for the Cyberflaneur.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Memories of Cyberspace</B>

<P>&nbsp;The spaces and places that we experience in Cyberspace remain
as memories in our mind, over time metamorphosing into a multitude of potentially
experienced realities. Bachelard observes that "of course, thanks to the
house, a great many of our memories are housed, and if the house is a bit
elaborate, if it has a cellar and a garret, nooks and corridors, our memories
have refuges that are all the more clearly delineated." The rooms we visit
in the virtual architecture of the Infosphere create the virtual house
that we decorate with virtual art and furnish with modules of information.
The Internet becomes a story, a mixture of fact and fiction, that we add
to every time we log on. As Cyberflaneurs we go 'window' shopping, admiring
the glitz of 3D graphics and on-line video and animation. The potential
for discovering new niches and drawers in our cyberhome makes us want to
come back. The cyberhome's cellar is the Multi-User-Dungeon, its main entrances
the search catalogues Alta Vista and Infoseek and its emergency exit the
'disconnect' button. Its doors are hyperlinks that lead to other rooms,
other realities. Sometimes we can't go any further because the house is
'under construction' and sometimes rooms have totally disappeared, leaving
only a vague memory -Alvin Toffler's shock of the 'missing supermarket'
can now be found on the Web, exemplified by the message "URL not found".
It is not a house but a mansion, and it is constantly metamorphosing. It
is alive.
