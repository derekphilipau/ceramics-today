            <P> <IMG align=left SRC="../images/b_gills.gif" alt="B">uilding on 
              previous issues relating to <a href="toxic_materials.html"><b>toxicology
              of ceramic materials</b></a>, this page concentrates on general 
              safety rules for the ceramic studio. Many of the rules below are 
              common sense and you may be well familiar with them. However, many 
              people are either not aware of some of these general guidelines, 
              or choose to ignore them... Most of these rules apply to the small 
              or large studio or college department alike. 
            <P align="center"><FONT color="#004000"><B>Studio Safety Rules</B></FONT> 
            <ul>
              <li> 
                <CENTER>
                </CENTER>
                Never sweep the studio ...rather vacuum with a small particle 
                filter in place or wet everything and mop or vacuum with a wet 
                pick up filter. Use an air filter if possible.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Open footwear, e.g.. sandals, etc., are inadequate. Full protection 
                is needed for your feet. <BR>
                </li><li>Loose clothing which 
                may accidentally find its way into operating machinery should 
                also be avoided. <BR>
                </li><li>Similarly with long 
                hair -- as above. <BR>
                </li><li>Floors should be 
                kept clean. Clean up spilt clay, slip and water and other materials 
                immediately. <BR>
                </li><li> Don't put your hand 
                into operating clay mixers etc., or you may find yourself neatly 
                blended into the mix. <BR>
                </li><li> Arrangement of benches, 
                bins, storage areas, etc., should allow maximum freedom of movement. 
                <BR>
                </li><li> Fire extinguishers 
                should be placed in an accessible position near the studio. If 
                a fire develops in the studio and you are keeping a fire extinguisher 
                there, the heat may prevent you from reaching it. <BR>
                </li><li> Accessibility of 
                power and light switches: keep switches and electrical cables 
                away from water or if this cannot be avoided sufficient protection 
                against contact should be made. <BR>
                </li><li> Never turn off electrical 
                appliances with wet hands especially in combination with water 
                on the floor. <BR>
                </li><li> Avoid use of extension 
                cords where they may intersect areas where traffic is most likely. 
                <BR>
                </li><li> Materials should 
                be stored in a dry place. Plaster should be set aside from these 
                materials. <BR>
                </li><li> Areas set aside 
                for plaster work should be cleaned thoroughly after use. Buckets 
                and other materials used for this work should be for plaster work 
                only, minimizing the possibility of foreign matter fouling up 
                clay. <BR>
                </li><li> Food and drink is 
                best consumed outside the studio or in an area where contamination 
                by chemicals, dust in the air, etc., is minimal. <BR>
                </li><li> Hands should be 
                washed immediately and thoroughly after handling glaze materials 
                and any other toxic minerals. <BR>
                </li><li> A well ventilated 
                area in the immediate vicinity of the kiln is mandatory; in fact 
                it is best to have kilns of all types outside the main studio 
                area thus eliminating the risk of poisoning yourself with carbon 
                monoxide, unburned gas, sulfurous gases, etc., emitted especially 
                during reduction. <BR>
                </li><li> Safety clothing, 
                eye protection, gloves, etc. should be easily accessible.<BR>
                </li><li> Wear welding goggles 
                when looking into a glowing kiln, otherwise eye cataracts will 
                develop over the years. <BR>
                </li><li> Never brush a kiln 
                shelf with bare hands. Jagged pieces of glaze or grit stick to 
                the shelf and can easily tear the skin. <BR>
                </li><li> Kilns should be 
                checked, so that they meet regulations stipulated by your regional 
                councils. <BR>
                </li><li> Never ignite a gas 
                kiln without opening the door a short way first. Accumulated gas 
                can ignite and explode. Opening the door allows igniting gas to 
                escape. <BR>
                </li><li> To check for gas 
                leaks use a gas detector or soapy water and a brush, but never 
                use a naked flame. <BR>
                </li><li> Auto cut off and 
                failsafes are preferable and should be checked periodically. <BR>
                </li><li> Extreme care should 
                be exercised when lifting heavy articles. It is essential for 
                the studio potter to be aware of correct lifting techniques otherwise 
                physical damage is inevitable. A trolley should be used if necessary.<BR>
                </li><li> Incorrect methods 
                of wedging large pieces of clay may cause injuries, especially 
                to the back. Damage may occur after a period of several years. 
                When wedging you should be well aware of your capabilities of 
                lifting a piece of clay, remembering that this weight has to be 
                maneuvered at least 21 times before it is wedged. Back and stomach 
                muscles are strained if the weight is too heavy. Secondly, the 
                hands should be released from the piece of clay on the downward 
                movement, just before it makes contact with its other half, otherwise 
                the sudden curtailing of momentum at table level creates jarring 
                tremor which is transferred through the body via the hands, the 
                latter of which acts as a lever and jerks the spine upward - not 
                good at all. </li>
