            <p> Most ceramics glazes are simple to formulate and very easy to 
              fire. But there are some glazes and glaze effects that have the 
              reputation of being elusive or at least difficult to obtain. This 
              was certainly the case early in the 20th century with copper reds 
              and celadon blues. These glazes had a history of secrecy and myth 
              surrounding them. One story even claimed that a Chinese emperor 
              had slaves thrown into the kiln during the firing in order to produce 
              the elusive copper red. Thankfully, that was found to be unnecessary, 
              because we learned that reducing the kiln early in the firing produced 
              beautiful copper reds. Oil spot glazes also have the reputation 
              of being elusive but, as I will show in this article, they are very 
              easy to create, once you know the process which makes them work.

              most important factor in obtaining oil spot glazes is firing in 
              an oxidation atmosphere. This cannot be overemphasized. Oxidation 
              is essential because of the mechanism by which the oil spots are 
              created. Simply stated, the red iron oxide molecule, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 
              will let go of an oxygen atom at approximately 2250&deg; F (1232&deg; 
              C). At this temperature, the red iron oxide molecule cannot maintain 
              its complex structure and will release an oxygen atom to become 
              the simpler FeO molecule, or black iron oxide. As the oxygen leaves 
              the red iron oxide molecule it bubbles to the surface of the molten 
              glaze, dragging a bit of iron with it (image on left). When it reaches 
              the surface and leaves the glaze it deposits the &#8220;spot&#8221; 
              of iron which creates the characteristic oil spot look. However, 
              if the glaze is reduced early in the firing cycle, the red iron 
              oxide will already have changed into black iron oxide, and there 
              is no possibility of an oxygen molecule being released later to 
              create the oil spot effect. So you can see that without an oxidation 
              firing cycle there will be no oil spot effect.</p>
            <p>The second most important factor is the glaze recipe. It must contain 
              some red iron oxide and be sufficiently stiff to hold the oil spots 
              that are created, but not too stiff to prevent the bubbling out 
              of the oxygen. Feldspathic bases are perfectly suited to create 
              oil spots. The following are some excellent recipes:</p>

            </table>
            <p>Each recipe contains a high amount of feldspar, over 50%, some 
              magnesium oxide, either from talc or dolomite, and between 6.0 - 
              8.5% red iron oxide. Finally, the glaze needs to be fired between 
              cone 10 and 11, which I will discuss later.</p>
            <p>Another critical factor is the glaze application. If the application 
              is not thick enough there will be no oil spotting or only very small 
              spots, while thicker application will give larger spots (see image 
              5). The final glaze thickness should be at least 1/8&#8221; (0.3 
              cm) and can be as thick as 1/4&#8221; (0.6 cm). Usually if you apply 
              a glaze this thick it will run and fuse the pot to the shelf. But 
              this does not happen as frequently with oil spot glazes because 
              the feldspathic glaze is so stiff and, in addition, when iron is 
              fired in oxidation it is refractory which makes the glaze even more 
              viscous. This often results in a characteristic hanging glaze drip 
              at the base of the pot (see image 6).</p>

            </table>
            <p>So to summarize, oil spot glazes are usually stiff glazes which 
              contain red iron oxide and magnesium oxide. The glaze needs to be 
              applied thick and fired in oxidation to cone 10 or 11. If you follow 
              these simple steps then oil spot glazes are no more mysterious or 
              illusive than any other type of glaze. The hurdle that many people 
              run into is that they want to fire all their work with a standard 
              early reduction firing cycle. They then put some oil spot test tiles 
              into this firing cycle, only to be disappointed. Since early reduction 
              changes the iron they get no oil spots and think it is a difficult 
              glaze to achieve. But simply switching to an oxidation cycle is 
              all that is necessary. </p>
            <p>Once you know the mechanism which causes the oil spot effect then 
              producing it is actually quite easy. The difficult but fun part 
              is then creating variations in the effect and creating forms which 
              accentuate those effects. For example, you can alter the size of 
              the spots by varying the length of time it takes to fire from cone 
              7 to cone 11. If you go slowly, (4 hours), the spots will be larger, 
              while going faster will give you smaller spots. This is because 
              the process of releasing oxygen takes time and lengthening the firing 
              will allow more oxygen to be released, while firing too fast may 
              leave large unhealed blisters on the surface of the glaze. (This 
              can be corrected simply by refring the piece.) You can use a slightly 
              more complicated firing cycle to reduce these unhealed blisters. 
              In this firing cycle the kiln is in full oxidation to cone 9 and 
              is then is put into reduction through cone 11. This will help to 
              stop the bubbling and flux out the surface iron creating a smoother 
              glaze surface. Draw tiles are extremely helpful to determine when 
              the firing is complete. </p>
            <p>Another interesting variation is the &#8220;hare&#8217;s fur&#8221; 
              effect. This can easily be created by firing the glazes very hot, 
              above cone 11, which causes the glaze to run down the side of the 
              pot, pulling and lengthening the spots. Another interesting variation 
              is to put a stiff light colored glaze over the oil spot glaze. This 
              will cause an interesting leopard spotted glaze as the iron is drawn 
              to the surface (images 7 &amp; 8). These are only a few of the innumerable 
              variations possible with oil spot glazes.</p>

            <p>From this article you can see how simple it is to achieve the oil 
              spot effect. And knowing the process by which it works eliminates 
              the need to perform any brutal sacrificial rituals on your assistants. 
              Hopefully, you can use this knowledge as a spring board to create 
              new and beautiful variations of this ancient glaze.</p>
