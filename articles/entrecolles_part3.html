              Part 3 
            <p>From William Burton's <i>Porcelain, It's Art and Manufacture</i>, 
              B.T. Batsford, London, 1906. 
            <p>I have before remarked that the foot of the porcelain piece was 
              left solid; in fact, only after it has been glazed and is dry do 
              they put it on the wheel to hollow out the foot. After that they 
              paint on it a little ring, and often a Chinese letter, and when 
              this painting is dry they glaze the part that has just been excavated, 
              and that is the last thing they do to it before it is taken to the 
              firing. 
            <p> I have been surprised to see how a man can balance on his shoulders 
              two long and narrow planks on which the porcelain pieces are carried, 
              and that he goes like that through several well-populated streets 
              without breaking his ware. It is true that the people carefully 
              avoid knocking against him, however slightly, because they would 
              be obliged to pay for the damage they had caused, but it is astonishing 
              that the carrier himself controls his steps and all the movements 
              of his body so well that he does not lose his balance. 
            <p> Where the furnaces are we find another scene. In a kind of vestibule 
              before the furnace one sees piles of boxes and cases made of clay 
              prepared for holding the porcelain. Each vase of porcelain, however 
              small it may be, has its case ; the pieces that have covers as well 
              as those that have none-these covers are only slightly attached 
              to the bottom part during the firing, so that they easily come apart 
              by a little blow. The small porcelain pieces, like tea- and chocolate-cups, 
              are placed a good many in one case. In this operation the workman 
              imitates Nature, who to ripen the fruit and bring it to perfection, 
              puts it into a case so that the heat of the sun gets at it little 
              by little, and its action inside is not too much interfered with 
              by the air that comes from outside during the fresh nights. 
            <p> These cases (saggars) are lined inside with a kind of sand-down, 
              for they are covered with kao-lin dust as this sand does not stick 
              too much to the foot of the piece that is put on it. The bed of 
              sand is first pressed and given the shape of the bottom of the porcelain 
              piece, which does not itself touch the sides of its case. The top 
              of the case has no lid; a second case, after the shape of the first 
              and similarly filled with porcelain, comes on it, so that it covers 
              it completely without touching the porcelain underneath. In this 
              way they fill the kiln with big cases all containing porcelain. 
              Thanks to these thick veils the beauty, and, if I may say so, the 
              complexion of the porcelain piece is not sunburnt by the heat of 
              the fire. 
            <p> With regard to the small pieces of porcelain which are enclosed 
              in the big round cases, each one is put on a saucer of clay about 
              as thick as two crown pieces, and as wide as the foot of the piece 
              itself ; kao-lin dust is also strewn over these supports. When the 
              cases are a little too wide, they do not put porcelain pieces into 
              the middle, because these would be too remote from the sides, so 
              that they might fail in strength and open and sink, and thus cause 
              damage to the whole pile. It is well to know that these cases are 
              one-third of a foot in height, and that they are partly filled before 
              they have been fired at all. Those that have been fired previously 
              and are still serviceable are filled entirely. 
            <p> I must not forget the manner in which the pieces of porcelain 
              are placed in these cases. The workman does not touch the pieces 
              directly with his hands as he might break them, for nothing is more 
              fragile. He takes them off the planks by means of a little cord. 
              This cord is attached to a two-pronged wooden fork which he holds 
              with one hand, while with the other he holds the two ends of the 
              string that are crossed or opened according to the size of the piece; 
              the cord is passed round the piece, which is then gently lifted 
              and placed in the case or on its little saucer. All this is done 
              with incredible quickness. 
            <p> I have already said that the bottom of the furnace is filled with 
              gravel to the depth of half a foot. This gravel serves to steady 
              the piles of cases, which in the middle of the furnace rise to a 
              height of at least seven feet. The two bottom cases of each pile 
              are left empty, because they would be insufficiently fired, and 
              also because the gravel bed partly covers them. In the same way 
              the case which is placed on the top of the pile is left empty. The 
              piles in the middle of the furnace are filled with the finest porcelain 
              ; at the far end they place those pieces that are less fine, and 
              near the mouth they place those that are very strong, which are 
              composed of equal parts of kao-lin and Pe-tun-tse, and which have 
              been glazed with a stone that is somewhat black or reddish, because 
              this class has more substance in it than the other. The piles of 
              cases are placed close together, and are united by pieces of clay 
              put between them, at the top, at the bottom, and in the middle, 
              but so that a free passage is left for the flame to penetrate everywhere 
              evenly.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
            <p> Every kind of clay is not equally suitable for making the cases 
              ; here they have three kinds ; a common yellow clay which predominates 
              in quantity, a hard clay, and a very unctuous clay. The last two 
              kinds of clay are mined in the winter in very deep mines, where 
              it is impossible to work in the summer. 
            <p> Before the cases are fired they are yellowish ; after the firing 
              they are of a very dark red. For the sake of economy the yellow 
              clay is largely used, and that is why the cases only stand two or 
              three firings, after which they break completely. If they are only 
              slightly cracked or split, an osier ring is used to hold them together; 
              the ring burns away, but the case can be used this time without 
              the porcelain being injured. They have to take care not to fill 
              an oven entirely with new cases ; at least half of them must have 
              been fired before. These are placed at the top and the bottom of 
              the piles, while in the middle they place those that are newly made. 
              It is stated in the history of Fou-liang that the cases were formerly 
              fired alone before they were used for firing porcelain ; no doubt 
              in those days they thought less of the expense and more of a perfect 
              piece of work. 
            <p> [Here follows an account of the construction of the Chinese porcelain 
              furnace, but in place of it we reproduce the plan and elevation 
              of a furnace in use at Ching-to-chen at the present time, which 
              will explain its construction much more clearly than the account 
              given in the letters.] 
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ching-te-chen_kiln.gif" width="264" height="298"> 
            <p align="center"><b>A</b>.&nbsp;Fire mouth <b>B</b>.&nbsp;Body of 
              furnace <b>C</b>.&nbsp;Chimney <b>D</b>.&nbsp;Retaining wall <b>E</b>.&nbsp;Steps 
              to ascend to crown of furnace 
            <p> On the top of the furnace there are three little peep-holes, covered 
              with some broken pieces of pot, and they relieve the air and smoke 
              of the oven. The workmen judge the progress of the firing by uncovering 
              the peep-hole which is nearest to the chimney, and with some irons 
              they uncover one of the cases. They judge that the porcelain is 
              finished by the brightness inside the oven and especially how the 
              colours shine in their brilliance.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
              Then they leave off the firing and close up the furnace for some 
              time. The furnace is fired as follows : They first heat it for a 
              day and a night, then two men, who relieve each other, keep on putting 
              in wood, of which they burn as much as 180 loads. It is stated in 
              the annals that formerly they used 240 loads of wood, and twenty 
              more if the weather was rather rainy, although at that time the 
              ovens were only half as large as at present. They first kept up 
              a small fire for seven days and nights, and on the eighth day they 
              made a very fierce fire. It will clearly be seen, therefore, that 
              the old porcelains must have had more substance than the modern 
              ones. Formerly they observed one thing that is neglected nowadays. 
              When the firing was finished they did not open the furnace for ten 
              days for the big porcelain pieces, and for five days for the small 
              ones. At the present time they wait, it is true, a few days before 
              they open the furnace and take out the big pieces, for without this 
              precaution they would crack, but the small pieces are taken out 
              the following morning if the fire has been put out at the beginning 
              of the previous night. When the porcelain is burning hot the workman 
              who pulls it out can only touch it by protecting his hands with 
              the ends of a long scarf which hangs round his neck. I have been 
              surprised to hear that, after having burned in one day as much as 
              180 loads of wood, there were no ashes left in the fireplace the 
              next morning. 
            <p> After all I have said no one can be astonished that porcelain 
              is so dear in Europe, and still less so when they hear that, besides 
              the great profits of the European and Chinese merchants, the whole 
              oven-full is hardly ever successful. Sometimes it is quite lost, 
              and when they open the furnace they find the porcelain pieces and 
              the cases reduced to a mass as hard as rock. Neither is it easy 
              to regulate the fire, for the state of the weather instantly changes 
              the action of the fire, the quality of the material it acts upon, 
              and that of the wood which keeps it going. For one workman who gets 
              rich there are a hundred others who ruin themselves, though they 
              still try their fortunes further in the hope that they may save 
              enough to become shopkeepers. Moreover, the porcelain that is sent 
              to Europe is made after new models that are often eccentric and 
              difficult to reproduce; for the least defect they are refused by 
              the merchants, and so they remain in the hands of the potters, who 
              cannot sell them to the Chinese, for they do not like such pieces. 
            <p> <img src="images/hexagonal_lantern.gif" alt="HJexagonal lantern with flowers, birds and butterflies. (famille verte)" width="171" height="240" align="left">I 
              have said that the difficulty of making certain models sent from 
              Europe is one of the reasons why the pieces are so costly. It is 
              almost impossible for the Chinese to make some of the shapes sent 
              to them from foreign countries, although they make many things at 
              which foreigners are astonished, or that they would consider impossible. 
              For instance, I have seen a large porcelain lantern made in a single 
              piece, through which a candle lit up the whole room; this piece 
              was ordered seven or eight years ago by the heir-apparent.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
              <font size="-2">(See image on left)</font> 
            <p> The same Prince ordered also different musical instruments, amongst 
              others a kind of little organ called tseng, which is about a foot 
              high and contains about fourteen pipes, the melody of which is agreeable 
              enough; but every attempt to make this failed. They were more fortunate 
              in making flutes and flageolets, and another instrument, called 
              Yun-lo, which is composed of a set of little round, somewhat concave, 
              plates, each of which gives a particular note. Nine of these are 
              hung in a frame in different rows and played upon with small sticks 
              like the dulcimer; they ring like little bells and are used to accompany 
              other instruments or the voices of singers. They had, so they tell 
              me, to make many experiments to find out the thickness required 
              and the correct firing needed to produce all the tones and get all 
              the notes that are necessary for a chord. I had thought they must 
              have the secret of inserting a little metal in the body of these 
              porcelain pieces to vary the note, but they have undeceived me. 
              Metal is so ill-adapted to combine thin slabs with a space between, 
              joining them together only by cross-bars. These slabs have two holes 
              pierced at either end, so that they may be inserted in some cabinet 
              work or upon the back of a chair, where they look very effective. 
            <p> The history of Ching-te-chen speaks of different pieces, ordered 
              by the Emperors, that the potters have tried in vain to make. The 
              father of the reigning Emperor ordered some boxes, three and a half 
              feet long and two and a half feet high, and the bottom was to be 
              half a foot thick and the sides a third of a foot. They worked at 
              these pieces for three consecutive years, and made nearly two hundred 
              examples, not one of which was successful. The same Emperor ordered 
              some slabs for the front of an open gallery ; each slab was to be 
              three feet high and two and a half feet wide, and half a foot thick. 
              All these, said the old people of Ching-t2-chin, cannot be done, 
              and the Mandarins of this province presented a petition to the Emperor 
              supplicating him to stop this work. 
            <p> The Mandarins, knowing how great is the genius of Europeans in 
              inventions, have often asked me to procure from Europe new and curious 
              designs so that they might present something unique to the Emperor. 
              On the other hand, the Christians beg me very strongly not to procure 
              such models,, because the Mandarins cannot be so easily convinced 
              as our merchants when the workmen tell them that something is impracticable, 
              and often the bastinado is liberally administered before the Mandarin 
              will abandon a scheme that he thinks may be of profit to him. 
            <p> As each profession has its particular idol, and as Divinity is 
              conferred here as easily as the rank of count or marquis in some 
              European countries, it is not surprising that they have a god of 
              porcelain. Pou-sa (the name of this idol) owes its origin to those 
              designs which the workmen find it impossible to execute. They tell 
              us that formerly the Emperor decreed positively that some porcelain 
              pieces should he made after a pattern which he gave. He was told 
              several times that it was impossible, but all these remonstrances 
              only served to excite his desire. His officers redoubled their demands, 
              and used all kinds of severities to the workpeople. These unfortunates 
              spent all their money and tried their utmost, but they received 
              only beatings in return. At last one of them, in a moment of despair, 
              threw himself into the burning furnace and was consumed in an instant. 
              The porcelain in that furnace, so they say, came out perfectly beautiful 
              and to the satisfaction of the Emperor, who asked for nothing more. 
              From that time the unfortunate man was regarded as a hero, and became 
              in consequence the idol that watches over the workers in porcelain. 
              I do not know whether his elevation has tempted any other Chinese 
              to follow the same route with a view to a similar honour.<br>
              As porcelain has been so highly esteemed for many centuries, one 
              would wish to know how the porcelain of the earliest times differs 
              from that of our own days, and what the Chinese themselves think 
              about it. There is no doubt that China has her antiquaries who greatly 
              favor old things. The Chinaman himself is naturally prone to respect 
              ancient productions, though one finds those who defend modern work; 
              but porcelain is not like ancient medals, which reveal the science 
              of bygone times. Ancient porcelain may be decorated with Chinese 
              characters, but these do not denote any historical period, so that 
              the curious can only prefer them for something in the style and 
              the colours. I think I have heard it said, when I was in Europe, 
              that porcelain to be perfect must have been buried for a long time 
              in the ground. This is a false opinion which the Chinese ridicule. 
              The history of Ching-te-chen, speaking of the most beautiful porcelains 
              of earlier times, says that it was so much sought after that the 
              furnace was hardly opened before the merchants were disputing for 
              the first choice. It cannot be supposed from that that it had been 
              buried. It is true that in digging in the ruins of old buildings 
              and especially in cleaning out old, disused wells, beautiful pieces 
              of porcelain are sometimes found which have been hidden there in 
              times of revolution. This porcelain is beautiful because at such 
              times people would only think of hiding what was precious, that 
              they might recover it when the troubles were over. If it is esteemed 
              now it is not because it has acquired any fresh beauty in the heart 
              of the earth, but because its old beauty has been preserved, and 
              this alone is prized in China, where they give large sums for the 
              smallest utensils of the common pottery that was used by the Emperors 
              Yao and Shun, who reigned several centuries before the T'ang dynasty, 
              during which porcelain began to be used by the Emperors. All that 
              the porcelain acquires in growing old in the earth is a slight change 
              in its colourings or, if you prefer, in its tint, which shows that 
              it is old. The same thing happens to marble or ivory, but more readily, 
              because the glaze prevents the moisture penetrating so easily into 
              porcelain. I can say this, that I have found in old ruins porcelain 
              pieces that were probably very old, but I have not noticed anything 
              special about them. If it is true that in growing older they become 
              more perfect, they could not have been like the porcelain made nowadays 
              when they left the hands of their makers. What I believe is, that 
              formerly, as at the present time, there was porcelain of all prices. 
            <p> The Mandarin of Ching-te-chen, who honours me with his friendship, 
              makes his patrons at the Court presents of old porcelain that he 
              has the talent of making himself. I mean that he has found the art 
              of imitating old porcelain, or at least that of a moderate antiquity; 
              he employs at this work a number of workpeople. The materials of 
              these false antiques is a yellow clay found in a place near to Ching-to-chen 
              called Ma-an-shan (Saddle-back Hill). The pieces are very thick, 
              for a plate that the Mandarin has given me weighs as much as ten 
              ordinary ones. There is nothing special in the workmanship of these 
              pieces, only that they are given a glaze made from a yellow stone 
              which is mixed with the ordinary glaze, the latter predominating; 
              this mixture gives the porcelain a sea-green colour. These false 
              antiques also resemble genuine pieces in that they do not ring when 
              struck and make no humming noise when held close to the ear. After 
              it has been fired it is boiled for some time in a very fat broth, 
              and after that it is placed in the foulest sewer, where they leave 
              it for a month or more. When it comes out of this sewer it passes 
              for being three or four centuries old, or at least of the preceding 
              dynasty of the Ming, when porcelain pieces of this colour and thickness 
              were highly esteemed at Court. 
            <p>They have brought me from the debris of a large shop a small plate 
              that I value more highly than the finest porcelain pieces made a 
              thousand years ago. On the bottom of this plate is painted a crucifix 
              between the Holy Virgin and St. John ; I am told that formerly they 
              used to export such pieces to Japan, but that none of them have 
              been made for sixteen or seventeen years. Apparently the Christians 
              of Japan made use of this industry, during their persecution, to 
              procure images of our sacred mysteries ; this porcelain piece, mixed 
              in the case with the rest, might have escaped the search of the 
              enemies of our religion. These pious artifices must have been discovered 
              in the course of time and rendered of no avail by a stricter search, 
              and that is no doubt the reason why they have ceased to make this 
              kind of ware at Ching-te-chen.</p>

              be given here, but we cannot refrain from quoting the final sentences.]</p>
            <p> Ching-te-chen owes to the liberality of M. le Marquis de Bruise 
              a church which has a numerous congregation, increasing considerably 
              every year. May God pour His benedictions more and more over these 
              fresh faithful: I recommend them to your prayers. If they were helped 
              by some assistance to increase the number of catechists the people 
              of China would be enabled to learn that not only the luxury and 
              cupidity of Europeans make them send their money as far as Ching-te-chen, 
              but that there are zealous persons who have nobler intentions than 
              those who bring from there such fragile jewels.<br>
