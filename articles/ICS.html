              Kecskemét, Hungary 
            <p><b>About the International Ceramics Studio</b>
            <p> The <a href="http://www.icshu.org"><b>International Ceramics Studio 
              (ICS)</b></a> is a ceramic art center located in the town of Kecskemét, 
              eighty kilometers south of the Hungarian capital, Budapest. The 
              center was created over 25 years ago on the initiative of Hungarian 
              artists who had felt culturally and ideologically isolated by the 
              political system of that time. It was the wish for freedom and the 
              desire to work alongside international artists that led to the founding 
              of the center Since its establishment it has welcomed over 350 artists 
              from all corners of the world, and boasts an impressive collection 
              of over <a href="http://www.icshu.org/collection.html"><b>3000 works
              of contemporary ceramics</b></a> in its recently opened <a href="http://www.icshu.org/museion.html"><b>museum</b></a>.
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ics.jpg" width="394" height="163">
<p> The mission of the studio is to promote the formal, aesthetic 
              and technical development of ceramics and to help foster creative 
              skills. The studio is open to all challenges of ceramic research, 
              design and experiment. With this in mind the ICS offers modern facilities 
              and kilns, ample studio space and technical support.
            <p> We provide artists with the space to create new works, experiment 
              with innovative ideas, explore new directions in their work and 
              research new and different ways of making. Artists are encouraged 
              to explore all our facilities to open up new possibilities and directions 
              for the contemporary ceramist. Resident artists are able to exchange 
              ideas and experiences through presentations and informal discussion
            <p><b>Organized work programs</b>
            <p> Alongside the <a href="http://www.icshu.org/residency.html"><b>artist-in-residence
              program</b></a> the ICS organizes a series of <a href="http://www.icshu.org/courses.html"><b>thematic
              workshops, courses and events</b></a>, led by internationally respected 
              masters. Artists in residence may like to consider these programs 
              when scheduling their residency time. It may be that some programs 
              will be interesting or relevant to your work. Participation in some 
              Organized workshop programs may require an additional participation 
              fee. Please see the program pages on our website for information. 
            <p><b>Artist-in-Residence Program</b>
            <p> The <a href="http://www.icshu.org/residency.html"><b>artist-in-residence
              program</b></a> is open to all artists who wish to work independently 
              on their own pro|jects Artists may use the residency to accomplish 
              a specific pro|ject or to work in a creative and supportive atmosphere 
              alongside other international ceramic artists The luxury of time 
              and the studio environment allows for intense periods of creativity 
              free from the distractions of everyday pressures A valuable time 
              where art and life become one - in perfect balance. 
            <p> The ICS artist-in-residence program allows artists to work in 
              the context of a different country and culture We have created, 
              here in Kecskemét, a center of international cultural exchange, 
              allowing artists to work alongside others from a variety of rich 
              and culturally diverse backgrounds as well as local arts professionals 
              and students. 
            <p> On average the are up to ten artists in residence at the ICS at 
              any one time There are plenty of opportunities to interact with 
              the other artists but enough space to be quiet and reflective.

              Residency and International Contact at the studio Email <a href="mailto:mfo@icshu org">mfo@icshu
