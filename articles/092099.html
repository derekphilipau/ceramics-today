<A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/"><IMG align=left SRC="../images/m_gills.gif" alt="M" border="0"></A><A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/"><B>ary-Ann Prack</B></A> is a sculptor from Jefferson, North Carolina, USA, working in clay and metal. Her <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/image4.html"><B>semi-figurative</B></A>, <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/splitcenter.html"><B>semi-abstract</B></A> sculptures are colorful and fresh, while her <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/redwing2.html"><B>precise geometry</B></A> has a 'northern European' feel about it.
<P>
As she states in her <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/profile.html"><B>profile</B></A>, Mary-Ann see her work as a &quot;visual language of form, color, line and texture into... spirited, serious and elegant large scale clay abstractions&quot;.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/"><IMG align=left SRC="../images/prack.jpg" alt="Sculpture" border="0"></A>While working in clay, not many of Mary-Ann's forms reflect a tradition of pottery making and where this tradition becomes evident, it is undermined by techniques such as a hole in a vase form, such as in the work <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/redcenter.html"><B>'Red Centre'</B></A>.
<P>
May-Ann hand-builds her sculptures, with stoneware clay and carves the linework into the surface. Occasionally she will also use bronze, aluminum or stainless steel alloys. She is not only a maker of <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/c.html"><B>large ceramic sculptures</B></A>, suitable for outdoor public places, but also draws in a similar vein to her sculptural work. Despite the use of ceramioc materials, it would be good to see more of her <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/profskt2.jpg"><B>drawings</B></A> on the site.
<P> As far as web sites go, this one is simple but elegant and practical. Its 
  simple design is made up for by May-Ann's wonderful sculptures, more of which 
  can be seen on her <A HREF="http://www.prackart.com/gallery.html"><B>gallery
  page</B></A>.
