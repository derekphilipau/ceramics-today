              An Interview with Kanzaki Shiho<br>
              by Dick Lehman</b> &copy; 
            <p align="center"><img src="images/lehman/lehman1.jpg" width="170" height="257"><br>
              Shigaraki-yaki in Kanzaki's Showroom <br>
            
            <p>Northwest Airlines Flight #69 descended into Osaka, and I was returning 
              to Japan once again. Even though I am a foreigner here, this place 
              has been full of friendship and learning for me. My visits, over 
              the past 10 years, have enriched my life and widened my understandings. 
              But more than anything else, my times in Japan have prompted deep 
              ponderings, and have raised questions for my consideration -- questions 
              I may never have encountered anywhere else.
            <p>This trip was a little different from previous visits. Two writing 
              projects prompted my travel -- some work as technical editor for 
              the Furutani Michio text Anagama: Building Kilns and Firing (now 
              being translated into English), and work on an article I'm writing 
              that focuses on interviews with three generations of Masters and 
              Apprentices within the Japanese apprenticeship tradition.</p>
            <p><img src="images/lehman/lehman2.jpg" width="208" height="253" align="left">My 
              first stop was a visit with my friend Kanzaki Shiho, who lives in 
              Shigaraki. There I met with and interviewed Kanzaki sensei. Later 
              I interviewed his Master, Matsuyama Suketoshi, and Kanzaki's now-independent 
              Apprentice Matsukawa Hiromi -- all in an effort to learn more about 
              the Master/Apprentice system in Japan.</p>
            <p>&quot;Work&quot; was interspersed with visits to the Miho Museum 
              and the Shigaraki Cultural Park, travel to Tamba to visit friends, 
              and later a trip up to the Eichizen coast in search of area pots, 
              beautiful sunsets, and giant (delicious) crabs.</p>
            <p>It would be impossible to condense my hours of interviews with 
              Kanzaki-san. But I'd like to tell you about just one aspect of the 
              discussion. Kanzaki and I had a conversation about how he continues 
              to learn -- and how he (as a Master) teaches.</p>
            <p>In the early stages of learning, says Kanzaki, there might be the 
              need for inspiration that comes from outside of oneself. When he 
              was much younger, he would sometimes begin &quot;intentional learning&quot; 
              by examining pots, or images of pots, that he found interesting. 
              He said that he tried to look only at the things that were most 
              stimulating to him. And then, he would view a single piece continually 
              for two days. If, after two days of constant looking, he was still 
              fascinated with the piece, he would measure it as a piece worth 
              learning from. </p>
            <p>After this initial &quot;concentrated&quot; looking, Kanzaki would 
              not look at the piece for at least one year. (And he would not try 
              to make a piece that was inspired by this piece for at least a year.) 
              Instead he would let the image of the work, and his own imagination, 
              begin to mature in his mind. He describes this process as &quot;chasing 
              the image.&quot; The image began to change as it integrated into 
              Kanzaki's heart and soul and spirit. As the image changed, Kanzaki 
              continued to chase it. Over time, it became his own -- not so much 
              resembling the initial form, but having been distilled into something 
              of the spirit of the initial piece -- having been flavored by his 
              own spirit. And thereafter, as the making began, the chase continued. 
              The works themselves began to inspire a new round of chasing. &quot;It 
              is a matter of making works according to my own mind and heart and 
              spirit,&quot; Kanzaki emphasized. &quot;If you are a ceramic artist, 
              all your life and spirit and self can be explained through your 
              work.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But how do you teach your apprentices to make these kinds 
              of works,&quot; I asked.</p>
            <p>In response, Kanzaki says he never demonstrates the making process 
              for his apprentice, nor do they ever watch him actually make the 
              pots. &quot;Why?&quot; I wondered aloud. &quot;How can this be good 
              teaching?&quot; I pondered. </p>
            <p>&quot;If I show them how to make a chawan, maybe my apprentices 
              will always be only tracing my work. Maybe they will not be making 
              works that come from their own heart and spirit. Sometimes my apprentices 
              ask me, 'How do you do that?' Sometimes I say, 'I don't know.' In 
              this way I help them discover for themselves. Of course they make 
              some failures when they try to make their works. But there is much 
              learning by trying and failing. And if I tell them how, from the 
              beginning, they will not know, forever, the things they did not 
              learn by trying. In this way, I teach them everything that I know. 
              If I told them all the details of 'how-to-do,' they might be successful 
              one time. But by failing, they will have learned in a way that will 
              cause them to be successful every time in the future. If I show 
              them how, they know only that technique and cannot change easily. 
              If I don't show them how, my apprentices have to be thinking, thinking, 
              thinking to learn many ways of working. Then they can change their 
              way of working easily, and make the works that come from their own 
              heart and spirit.&quot; </p>

              Above: E-Shino Chawan by Matsuyama Suketoshi</p>
            <p>Kanzaki's teacher, Master Matsuyama, emphasized in my interview 
              with him the ultimate value of learning from failure.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;This is the important learning -- to know more than technique. 
              In this way I open all secrets to my apprentices. To have a big 
              heart is to open all secrets. And big hearts can make big works. 
              And if my apprentices learn this important lesson, they will become 
              successful at making their own works. And if they become successful, 
              I do not hate or envy them. (To envy their success would be to have 
              a small heart, and small hearts can make only small works.) No, 
              to the contrary, I am very proud when my apprentices succeed in 
              learning all my 'secrets.' I will have been, for them, the 'founder' 
              of this way of working.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I always try to teach my apprentices everything, to teach 
              them to go beyond all that they have been taught, and to make works 
              that come from their own heart and soul and spirit.&quot; </p>
