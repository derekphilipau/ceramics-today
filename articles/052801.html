              following article by Mark Brabham on kilns and kiln firing was initially 
              published on Claynet. Part 1 covers the following areas: Check List, 
              Natural Gas vs L.P. Gas, Safe Kilns and Firings, Safety Devices 
              for Kilns and Maintaining Burner Safety Controls. Part 2 covers 
              Temperature Measurement and Control, Color Scale Chart and Industrial 
              Firing Processes. 
            <p><b> Check List</b></p>
            <p> Please note: The following information relates to atmospheric 
              gas burners only, i.e. burners that rely on atmospheric air, as 
              distinct from air from an air fan, for combustion. 
            <p> The chimney passage must not be restricted and the sizing should 
              be checked carefully first. A rough rule-of-thumb ratio is 1 square 
              inch of flue area to 8,000 BTU's of maximum gas input. Tight packing 
              of the ware without a definite passage for the hot gasses can cause 
              a problem. Increased firing times and reduction may indicate a problem 
              here. Ensure the burners are mounted outside the burner port openings 
              and the correct amount of secondary air (the air pulled in around 
              the burner tip) is available. This can vary between burner types. 
              Venturi type burners require less wasteful, secondary air other 
              burners may need larger ports to enable complete combustion. 
            <p> Make sure the gas supply components such as the feed line, gas 
              regulator or gas bottles are of a sufficient size. Freezing of any 
              of these indicates a problem. It is wasteful to undersize components 
              and have large pressure drops. It is also important to make sure 
              the burners are assembled correctly with adequate mixing length 
              between the air inspirating section and the burner flame retaining 
              tip. 
            <p> It is important to keep the right ratio between the amount of 
              gas fed to the burners and total air required for combustion (secondary 
              and primary air) as close as practicable. This is approx. 24 parts 
              air to 1 part gas for L.P. Gas and 10 parts air to 1 part gas for 
              natural gas and will make sure the kiln fires to temperature as 
              quickly as possible using minimum gas. This is only possible during 
              those periods when reduction or excess air firing is not necessary 
              (some excess air can be helpful in the earlier stages of a firing). 
              Altering the chimney damper changes the pressure condition in the 
              kiln, thereby controlling the amount of secondary and primary air. 
              Primary air can also be controlled separately on venturi burners 
              by altering the "wheel" or shutter on the inspirator casting. 
            <p> The most common problem is the kiln not reaching temperature. 
              Although there are many possible reasons, the first thing to check 
              is the gas supply pressure. It is a benefit with L.P. Gas kilns 
              to have a gauge on the burner as well as the bottle/tank as this 
              acts as a check to ensure dirt particles have not been trapped in 
              the line. The pressure on the cylinder is compared to the pressure 
              at the burner, a large pressure drop indicates a restriction. Ensure 
              the gas bottle outlet valve is absolutely clean before refitting 
              the connection after filling.
